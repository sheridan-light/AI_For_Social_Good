SuicideWatch,"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",t3_cz6nfd,1

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here.

SuicideWatch,"All I want is to be a normal person who can just *do* the things they need to. Instead, it's an immense struggle just to motivate myself, convince myself my life isn't worthless, for even half an hour. And no matter what I do — whether I try to use that motivation to better myself, learn things, exercise, or I just sit around and do nothing, it always ends the same way. Wondering why I ever felt optimistic. Everything is such an effort. Sometimes breathing is too much of an effort. 

How can people not only come up with something that makes them happy to be alive, but *work* towards those things?

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here.

I've realized that I'm unattractive, I have a weak chin and two broken front teeth and my parents don't give a single shit about that, my lips are too small and my nose is too big or wide, I have acne and scars, everything about my face just doesn't fit. I'm overweight too to make it worse.

I live in asia. I hate the country that I live in right now, it's a 3rd world country with corrupt leaders. I don't like how close minded the people here. This country is also very religious and homophobic and I'm a raging bisexual who's mostly into men, I dunno I might just be gay. I'm still struggling with my sexuality and. I can't relate to anyone here cause we don't share a lot of interests. I mostly watch western shows and I can relate more to western pop culture, the people I follow on youtube and tiktok and other socials are mostly westerns too. I don't have friends to talk to about my interests and no one will get the references and jokes I'd make so I just don't talk.

I have two older brothers and a younger sister and we don't talk at all, my parents also don't talk to each other. Because we're poor I have to share a room with my father and two brothers so I don't really get even a tiny bit of privacy to be myself. 

I'm tired of living like this, living a gay, ugly, fat, poor, and uninteresting life. Everyday since this quarantine started I've thought about ending my life.

i could see the edge, i felt like jumping. i saw her, and i swear she ignored me. i couldn't do that though but i carefully observed the place for the best part to do it.

somebody offered me sleep medicine, and i spit out my first cup but drank more. suddenly, she went near and held me.

it's fake. she just doesnt want to be caught being in the same place and not doing anything and i dont want to settle for lies.

I've convinced myself before that I'm a coward for giving up and that I need to try absolutely everything before going through with it. But at this point I'm just done.

At school, home and in public, I been constantly ripped on for being disabled and existing in this cold world. My grammar is at 4th grade level at best. Autism has caused me to be completely unresponsive and shut down on others when I attempted to communicate and relate to others, so the internet is the only way to communicate. 

My philosophy about people with intellectual disability and autism is they should live in apartheid type of segregation, and deserve no dignity and get treated as a convicted child molester. And my mom didn’t like my autism and that abet me from having a bad attitude towards the disabled, lgbt and any genetic lowlives. 

Suicide isn’t a way out of this merciless suffering, being a murderer, ruthless person will. The fact is that slow people are more likely to commit abhorrent felony than the general population, and that’s considered INFERIOR BEHAVIOUR!

I don’t really know anymore. I am overwhelmed by various mental illnesses, and all of them together is just absolute HELL. I didn’t think one person could have so many mental illnesses....

I still miss my first love. I’m so dumb because we were together for such a tiny period of time and we were 15, but it felt so real and it felt like we’d been together for a long ass time. When she broke up with me, something inside of me broke. Something just kind of...left. And I haven’t been able to get it back. Shit SUCKED back then. She was the only positive thing about that time. But yet when you look at pictures of me back then and compare them to pictures of me now, something looks to be missing. Like something tore me apart. It’s in my eyes, for the most part. I guess my eyes look more dull now, after experiencing that. I didn’t realize that a short relationship would destroy me so much and that I was nothing without her.

We’re coming up on some painful anniversary dates now. It’s been 6 years since our relationship. I don’t know what makes a 6 year anniversary so painful, but this year it just seems excruciating beyond belief. The circumstances surrounding the breakup make it worse.

I’m so lonely. I’ve been single for like a year or more, despite trying so many dating apps. No one is attracted to me. It’s really sad how some people my age are having relationships that have lasted for like 5+ years, meanwhile I can’t even keep a relationship for more than 3 months most of the time. My longest relationship was 9 months, but that’s it. I’m unlovable, I guess.

This quarantine isn’t necessarily helping either. Let me talk about some of the mental shit I’ve been going through during this whole pandemic.

Even before it was declared a pandemic, I was terrified and convinced that it would come here. Well, guess what? It DID. And it’s apparently hit us harder than any other country. Lovely. Especially when I worry about my health in general (I have Illness Anxiety Disorder; it was formerly known was hypochondria but that’s an outdated term that, honestly, I don’t really appreciate because at this point it’s used more of a joke or insult so I hate that word).

When it was declared a pandemic, I was horrified. It didn’t make it any better that I came down with an awful “cold” (looking back on it, I think I might’ve had it...I won’t go into detail but let’s just say it was awful). Earlier on, I saw lots of posts about how stores were super crowded, how people were hoarding toilet paper, etc.
I remember pacing back and forth in my living room, asking my parents a bunch of questions no one could really answer at the time. “What does this mean?” “When is this gonna end?” “Who the hell brought it to the US?!” “It’s not in (insert my city name here), is it?” “How much longer until we can do normal stuff again?”

However, early on I was able to keep a positive attitude. Even when I was sick, I told my mom, “If I do have it, I want to take the opportunity to help other patients by giving blood or participating in some kind of study. I just want to help and would gladly use this to help others.”

Within a few weeks, though, my fear turned to rage. Absolute, unadulterated rage. My mind was trying desperately to place the blame on someone who was involved, and my rage was mainly directed at whoever brought it to the US. The reason was because it’s more abstract to be mad at the world; it’s rather simple when you can blame a single person. I guess that’s how my thought process works. Sometimes in these attacks of rage I was unable to see straight because I was so mad. (Now might be a good time to mention I have borderline personality disorder so that makes it so much worse)

And then I went numb. I was completely unable to cry. I started isolating myself from friends (isolating in all senses of the word; of course, I’m a responsible person so I’m respecting the mandatory quarantine, but I’m also not really staying in touch with friends I used to text or call every day). I was in denial for the longest time. I was irritable beyond belief. I started snapping over the tiniest things. I seemed to be on edge all the time. I’m a very jumpy person, but I mean I’d be startled by the sound of a light switch. It was bad. And it’s still going on.

I’m having constant nightmares. Sometimes I’ll wake up screaming or panicking. A good percentage of them are about the virus. Others are just generally about death and destruction. In most if not all of my dreams, I’m fully aware that we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Sleep is no escape.

I went through a period of being incredibly tired. I couldn’t be comfortably awake for more than like 5 hours without feeling tired and having to resist the temptation to fall asleep again. Luckily this only lasted a while, and it’s gotten a lot better, but I’m still sleeping a lot.

I’m not really taking care of myself either. I can’t tell you the last time I showered. Not brushing my teeth regularly nor washing my face or applying my face cream, not using deodorant, etc. because what’s the point? I’m also emotionally eating.

The other day I dissociated so much I legitimately questioned whether the world was real or simply a simulation. I convinced myself nothing was real, that everything was in my head. It’s scary feeling so detached and not there.

If you read this far, thank you. It’s been really hard and my already-intense emotions seem to be a bit stronger during this. I do believe that I am going to develop agoraphobia. Hell, I even Googled “is it possible to stay home for the rest of your life” yesterday. I know that, even after quarantine ends, I’ll still refuse to go out. I haven’t left the house since March 11th. I took a walk around the block like a month ago, with a mask on, but that was it. I won’t even get in the car for a car ride because I’m so paranoid.

The world is so fucked up too, so I wonder what the point is. There will always be animal abusers, abusers in general, crimes, etc and there’s nothing I can do about it, and that’s absolutely not a world I want to live in. I’m just super overwhelmed.",I just don’t know anymore.,t3_gtce77,1

SuicideWatch,"Seven billion of us all packed together on a spinning ball of rock. I feel like I'm incapable. Of living properly, the way our society is built. All I've ever wanted was a purpose, I guess. Childhood years of TV and books boasting hero's with greater divine purpose made me bitter about my own pointless existence. In every story there's the protagonist. I feel as though I'm not even the protagonist to my own story. There's no great quest, no objective. 

On top of that, out of seven billion people on this shit hole planet, I am a sorry excuse for anything. I am the biggest waste of talent and space I know. I could do so much better but for whatever reason my whole life I've always been stopping myself. All I do is scroll endlessly on my phone. I can't change. It just doesn't work. I'm stuck because my own brain will always be fucking me over, and I can't live with the what could have beens. I've shot down so many opportunities for me to succeed. I don't have a chance when everyone else on this planet is better than me it seems. Maybe that's irrational but I can't help looking at others and comparing myself. I don't stack very high.

I'm so scared of not being able to find a niche. Like I'll just be bumbling around at various dead end jobs without living up to my full potential.

SuicideWatch,"I am sorry in advance this is going to be a little long. I am a 22 year old male who suffers severe depression, Social anxiety and maybe even more that i don't know about. Just a little backstory: 

I was born in a developing dirt poor country but grew up in Germany, Berlin from ages 2-12. My mother was physically very abusive towards me the last time she beat me i still clearly remember she used to hit me to the ground and stomp on my knees even when I was crying my eyes out she didn't care and my dad didn't really do much aside from pathetically pleading a little. I feel sorry for my mother because she never really lived before coming to Germany i think that's why she lost it so much. She had me when she was 15. My mother was a housewife and living under my father for almost a decade. My father had especially at that time the midset that women are lesser. Anyway I grew up with my father for most of the time and he really tried to fuck me up mentally just because he grew up a certain way in a different environment he thought he was right. I went to school til 5th grade and halfway through my father took me with him back to his origin country. I didn't really have a say in it. He was scared that my mother would take me away from him and because of their fights i was the one being fucked. Imagine growing up in a first world country and then somebody throws you to fucking animals in another place. From 12-17 I had the worst time of my life! Alot of people there were racist, sexist and violent and for alot of people it was the norm. They don't understand depression or any other disorder. If you can't see it it must be unimportant. I was bullied in school everyday from 7th to 9th grade. My teacher was somewhat of a bully too and she made fun of me alot for being the way i am closed off, had extreme ocd at the time too and nobody understood. Cousins were the worst assholes imaginable i am glad i'm away from them. At the time I didn't have anywhere to run to and the hope that someday i'll get out was the only thing keeping me going. When I was 17 my father understood that this country isn't for me and took me with him to Russia. There I started working my first job at a restaurant for 2 years. We both did. After 2 years of that I couldn't take it anymore because i was fatigued and hated the job and the disorders don't help. The reason we did all this was my Visa for Germany expired after months after leaving and the documents were either thrown away or lost. My father decided that in Russia we could somehow make some money and pay for documents and everything(Don't judge please). The last 2 years i haven't worked at all. The place that i worked at the owner was a friend of my father so no workpermint was required. After being depressed as hell and with no hope i got out of there had some fight with the owner who was a real prick and now i am jobless. I know my father is sorry for what he did to me but i resent him and sincerely wish him death. I don't care that half of the time he was good the bad was truly unpleasant. Unfortunately we live together and in the moment he is the only one working and i don't know what to do. My destination has always been to come to the states and become an actor(I know theres millions of those) but  that's who i am theres nothing i can do beside that. I even got professional headshot done and opened a backstage account but bad fucking luck for me because after 1 month this fucking Virus hit the world and now i am stuck. Thrown out of 2 apartments allready because some people don't care that there is no work. This has been the worst 22 years of my life! I don't want to keep going and every year i get more and more depressed. I blocked people out of my life not only the bad ones. For some reason i don't like to be around people. I am a virgin and never was in a relationship mostly through my own fault. Don't have any friends. As much as i am a loner sometimes i get extremely sad and have a panic attack. I might be at home and fall to the ground and break down and start crying. I have body dismorphia also but some days i can handle it. I feel weak and pathetic for not being able to  help myself. I have mommy issues. Sometimes when i see a mother on the street holding their child i am very happy for them and at the same time i get extremely sad that i'll never have that. I am crying while typing this down i am so sorry for this long post but theres sooo many feelings inside of me that i don't know how to write down. I remember seeing Mad men and Don Drapers depression really resonated with me. For the past 2 years my depression has been getting worse and worse and i can't get out of this rut and i don't know what to do. People expect me to get over it, the bad relationship with my father gets worse and worse but i know i can't keep fighting with him over what he did, i have nobody in my life because of being a recluse. I feel like i never grew up and it's soo difficult getting out of my comfort zone. Been thinking about killing myself more times than i can remember but i lack the courage to do so but i always come back to it. I don't want to suffer! I know that everybody has to look out for themselves but i can't do this alone. I am a scared little kid in a grown up body. Someday my death will be by suicide i can feel it. I cant imagine living another 30 to 40 years because no matter how good things might be the damage is already done the scars are deep.

I HOPE NOBODY EVER GOES THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. 22 YEARS HAVE SUCKED THE LIFE OUT OF ME. I USED TO BE THE HAPPIEST KID BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST LONG. FUCK MY PARENTS AND FUCK MY LIFE.

TLDR at the bottom 

She has a very abusive family, her mom beats and belittles everyday. Since her mom is so crazy her dad is stressed out because of it and treats her like shit because he's stressed out because of her mom. And her little sister was manipulated into only trusting her mom because her mom is manipulative. And it's been like this her entire life, and now that she's stuck inside with her family because of quarantine it's gotten a lot worse.

Even when her mom kicks her out she'll search the streets and go to all of her friends house to find and drag her back to their home again. And i've always tried to stay positive but she just kind of broke recently. And tbh yeah her situation is pretty damn hopeless. Until she can graduate highschool and be on her own she's stuck being abused mentally and physically for the next two years. 

How do I keep her from killing herself when it seems like she doesn't really have any other option left? How do I keep her motivated to stay alive when there's really nothing else to live for?

Well, for some reason, I have multiple friends that have depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. And when I say ""multiple"", I mean all of them. Idk why, tho

Had the ""live is good and continue"" talk to many times, it actually helped most of them, but some... just, no matter what I do, it's always someone who I can't help, someone who captivated me and now is just... Leaving. Leaving me, and all that they could live for. 

I had the talk to many times, it failed to many times, I'm scared and it's meaning just start do disappear. I'm going to be like them? I don't want to keep it, don't want to keep this life without them. I always think the problem is me, most of my friends are like this and maybe it's me who brings it to their life???  But, I fear that if I gave up and make what they did, my other friends are going to be sad like me and I don't want them to be sad.

I have a family who is not supportive or whatever, it's just a ""do your work and have good grades. If u don't, u aren't going to get food or things u like"", because of it I searched for friends who could be the family who I need/wanted. Found them, and they are just fucked up like me, I do my best for them! So why Everytime I say I am the one who is felling really down, they say like ""Oh, me too, wants to know why I'm felling down and ignore whatever u was going to say about ur life or whatever""? I mean, I always listen to them, why they can't listen me one time? 

I mean, I'm not really complaining about them, they are the only ones who accepted me, I love them. But be the one who always need to """"""""""""""save"""""""""""""" them is tiring af. I just want to have a conversation with them, just one who I can say my problems and not listen theirs. I mean, I know it's probably arrogant and egoistic, but, one time is just everything I need.

I lost so many friends and family to suicide, and I can't take it anymore. Do u know how it feels don't knowing when one of the most important persons of u live are just gonna disappear? And its just gonna be your fault, MY fault.

I don't know what to do anymore.

SuicideWatch,"Hi folks, 

A few months ago I made an attempt (I’m not sure if it was real or a cry for help myself) for the first time in life. 32 years old. Anyone who knows me would say I used to be the life and soul and a happy go lucky kinda guy. 

Over last few years I’ve deteriorated.

The reason I’m here today to ask for help (as these strong feelings of suicide aren’t new).

My life unravelled around this time last year when I pissed of an entire workplace by basically being a nob. It started with some nasty comments and then became a vicious circle of bullying and me being abrasive because of it. Through cocaine, other drugs and heavy mental abuse and bullying towards me I basically imploded. I sent some nasty text messages that have been used against me and follow me everywhere (workplaces) by people I pissed off. 
After not being able to get away from gaslighting in other workplaces I made the attempt on my life. Since the attempt now my friends are making comments and also seem to have no empathy nor care for what they’re doing.

Unfortunately I’ve now lost all my friends, and family. No job. No money. And am currently residing at my grandmother’s who is supporting me. My grandmother lives where I grew up and people just make comments to me about stuff that happened at that workplace. I’ve been dragged through the mud because of that places fear of a court case. It’s a long story and I don’t think telling it would help any advice. It’s all my fault, but I’m not what I’ve been made out to be.

I can’t motivate myself anymore for tomorrow, I’m scared, upset and hurt. The worse part is I’m now gaslighted by everyone (dad, sister, so called friends).

They won’t tell me anything but yet still make comments.

Basically I’m at rock bottom, and today I ran out of tobacco so everything’s on top of me right now.

Any enjoyment seems so far away. I honestly feel powerless and lost and I used to have such a drive in me.

I’ve got into a wierd horrible habit of planning to kill myself a week later so that that week in question seems easier but even that fails to cheer me up.

SuicideWatch,"The past couple days, I've been feeling incredibly down, and it always ends with me wanting to end it all. But then again, I fear the pain that comes with death. I finally had enough when I was so scared of myself that I texted a crisis hotline. About two minutes into our conversation, the worker on the other end just told me that they were concerned for my safety and asked if I wanted to end my life. I was pretty sure she was going to call the local police department if I had said anything else. I got super scared because while I was thinking about death, I still had no plan, and I still live with my parents but they don't know what I am going through. Because of that, I decided to make it seem like I was just struggling in school and not doing that well because of COVID, (true to some extent, but not the root of my thoughts). 

I feel with these hotlines, while they are helpful to some, in many situations, they are too direct to the book instead of actually listening to your feelings. I would have been okay speaking about my suicidal tendencies, in that I had not really come up with a plan but just have been thinking about it, but the fact that the worker mentioned that they were concerned and going to get me help really worried me. I think that if the conversation just went as normal, it would have cleared up the thoughts on its own.

I need to leave this place or I will never earn the respect of anyone. People even looked down on me when I was 21 in this position. And I spent so much time smoking weed. I'm only two weeks clean. It could take fucking months until I can even piss clean. I think every fucking minute about how I'm going to afford to live. Every asshole tells you something different. Oh you need to stay at home and get an education. Oh you need to get the fuck out out at all costs. Oh don't worry about what people think as long as you have a plan. Move away to a different town. Stop being a pussy and join the military. This and that, this and that, this and that. But what do I want? I don't want fucking anything anymore. Two weeks clean, one month down of living on an actual budget, trying to figure out how much more housing is going to cost. I live in a piece of shit area where the rent even with roommates is going to be too much. Enough to be barely scraping by on but not enough to even be upwardly mobile in life. Then assholes tell you go fuck yourself just join the military or stay at home and go to school or get an apprenticeship. But I can't deal with the fucking shame of being here anymore.

SuicideWatch,"i've never used reddit before but i have no one to go to anymore, so please understand as i type this out. if anyone is out there, though, please help me. i'm sorry this is long, but i can't stop waking up feel hopeless.

i am not going to lie and change my story to garner pity, but i will provide context so people know what is going on and why i feel this way. i was rightfully called out (along with a friend) for ignoring someone in months ago when they (i'm going to call them person A) asked for my help, specifically when they were getting racist lynching and anti-r\*pe threats. person A asked me to do something because they thought my friends had something to do with it and felt desperate. i feel guilty for not at least trying to help this black teen especially in times like these. i was not close to them but they were an old friend my friends cut off, and i was under the impression person A was a liar and sought out petty drama because of the things i was told. but i am not going to defend me being an awful bystander by saying i didn't know. i will say i told them the threats were vulgar and horrible, but said there was no way i could control the person sending them to them because i was also receiving similar things like people anonymously telling me to kill myself on social media. i told person A ""i have the flu, i'm a full-time college student, please don't accuse my friends of doing this"" and i regret that. on top of that, i turned a blind eye to one of my friends making racist tweets a while ago because she was my friend and i was letting that cloud my own judgement. i'm angry at myself for that alone because being chinese, i should KNOW better. i know better now, but i should've known better THEN. i am ashamed of myself for not doing anything. not doing anything is not any better than doing something. i was a bystander. i am angry at myself and i was prepared to face the consequences of my poor decisions because i believed it was fair. i refuse to run from my mistakes like those who have hurt me have. and this all came to the notice of my friends about 2 days ago.

at first, i apologized over and over and acknowledged that i was not doing my part as a POC and being an ally to others. i've said it so many times i feel like a broken record. i know i deserve to face the consequences, but i did not think it included losing all my friends. and to those who are reading this, they may wonder why losing all my friends feels like i am dying. my biological family is broken and i am a victim of abuse, so i do not trust them. i am already depressed and some other people in my life, more distant friends, wouldn't understand and aren't particularly good at comforting. my main friends are the only ones who feel like a genuine family, and i was happiest with them. these were the people who would pick me up when i was down and help me laugh. but having 99% of them cut me off was like i got my own heart ripped out. during quarantine, too, i'm so desperate for any semblance of contact. i miss seeing group chats light up, i miss waking up and calling my friends, and i miss all of them. but after they cut me off, i don't know how they're feeling, some of them replied to me bluntly, and many of them told me they were disappointed in me. everything i've said to try and express my remorse is met with silence or it feels like what i say is being misinterpreted constantly. i am already bad at writing down my thoughts. i know i deserve to be yelled at it but it hurts to read alone because i'm stupidly sensitive. it hurts knowing they're in another group chat laughing together when i wish that were me, knowing they're discussing ""what to do with me"" and wishing i could just speak. but i'm scared of what they may say, having my words twisted, and not saying the right thing.

being alone yesterday for only a few hours drove me up the wall and i started sobbing in and out of the day because i felt like i had nothing and i didn't want to live with myself because i was so disappointed in myself. i rarely cry unless i really am in a lot of pain. i was sad that i had nothing to reach out to and i was grasping at air. i haven't been this alone since i was 15 and battling my suicidal thoughts then. i need someone to talk to and i don't know what to do. i have so many questions and i can't sleep because i am haunted by what i have done. i haven't eaten anything in over 24 hours except for maybe some watermelon, and i still don't feel hungry. i sat on my bed in the afternoon and looked out the windows and the sky was practically gray. all i could hear were the cars driving past me and thinking is it really worth living is this how you'll feel every day? unable to live with yourself and alone? i refuse to forgive myself. and if i cannot forgive myself, i don't see the point of staying alive. i want to step in front of those cars so badly, but they might not even put me out of my misery. the pain is not worth staying alive, but how do i make it stop?

there's so many things i want to say. i'm partly confused why my friends cut me off when a lot of them also did the same thing as me, making fun of the person afflicted, as we all immaturely gave in to things like mob mentality. they egged me on. i egged them on. we were all complicit in hurting person A, not myself alone. and i don't say this because i'm in pain and i want them to be in pain with me. but i'm not sure why only i should be punished, rightfully so, when i was in a similar boat as everyone else. the only difference, i think, was that i was the one approached. i provided the reply. i feel like i am breaking not only under the weight of my wrongdoings, but the wrongdoings of others, too. but i'm scared to vent about it in other places because i do not want to be seen as guilt-tripping or grasping at straws.

now i've reached the part that i'm incredibly scared about. i've been suicidal times in my life, when things have been bad, but nothing like this. i've never called a suicide hotline before because i've been too scared to, but i needed someone to talk to so badly. an adult with more knowledge, someone who could tell me how to fix this, or give me a reason to be alive. i called 4 times and sobbed every time on the floor in my closet with disgusting wet tissues, one was a man and he gave me very half-hearted and poor responses, and i was disheartened almost every time. i don't want to live without my friends. i don't want to live with myself. i don't have anything else to look forward to in my life anymore. i feel betrayed not because of my actions, but that my friends aren't willing to acknowledge that we were all bad to person A. i feel betrayed by myself for not living up to my strong morals. i'm trying so hard to be mature but it's so hard when all i want to do is breakdown and cry. all i do is lay down in bed, with nothing to laugh at, unable to sleep or distract myself with things i like to watch. i am empty. i keep trying to find a reason to live, because killing myself sounds so scary, but it seems like the easiest and best option. my friends don't need me. no one needs me. but i am afraid. please help me.",please help me i feel like i have nothing,t3_gtfqxh,1

Giving up sounds so much easier than trying to fight it off honestly. I always surrender to those thoughts, I never have a clue how to go about dealing with them at this point that I don’t even try. 

I have some sort of paranoia, so when I lay in bed at night wondering if someone might break in, I don’t often fear them dragging me off my bed and shooting me point blank. Yet in other cases, my mind and body acts differently and automatically makes choices to save myself. It’s stupid. 

Apparently still being alive means you don’t want to die and that you want to be here. How utterly bullshit that is, I probably couldn’t encompass in this one post. I’m only here because you fuckers can’t live without me, not because I want to be. 

Lives are literally at stake if I take mine away. My best friend follows the same fate, the other one becomes extremely depressed, they all wonder where they went wrong or what they could have done differently to change the circumstances or to save me.

So no, it’s not some cheery “well a part of you is subconsciously wanting to live!” bullshit. I’m only here because of other people, I’m basically making the choice to live in this cruel world and suffer for others to be happy having me around, where my only escape is sleep. 

And they don’t even appreciate me for that, they only want to make excuses to try and dictate and pick out how I’m feeling as if they’re in my body and understand my feelings. It’s a poor form of empathy or understanding. It’s pathetic. 

Apparently chickening out on every attempt you make means you want to be alive. Also complete and utter bullshit, I chicken out because I think of *you* idiots who would have to find my body. I think of *you* fuckers that would be sad without my existence. It’s because not because I want to be alive, it’s because I’m sparing ***you*** the trouble. 

So to sit and tell me, as another suicidal person, “well, I’m still alive because everyone wants me to be, therefore you should do the same”- THATS EXACTLY WHAT IVE BEEN FUCKING DOING THIS WHOLE TIME, EVEN IF I ABSOLUTELY DONT WANT TO. ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU CANT SEE THE REAL MOTIVE BEHIND MY ACTIONS, AND CHOOSE TO MAKE UP YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS. 

Anyways I apologize for getting riled up, I’m just honestly completely and utterly pissed off that people can choose to sit here and make their own conclusions about your thoughts and feelings without taking into account your reasons and motives behind acting the way you do.

It comes off less as supportive and understanding, but more as “I don’t understand what you’re going through at all, therefore I’m going to sit here and dismiss the way in which you feel and make up my own conclusions to suit myself and my selfish needs”.",Apparently I don’t even have a say in dictating choices for my own life anymore,t3_gta7bx,1

Thank you for the people who read this and gave some time to notice my situation. 

Lets start. 

I was never the type of person to be sad and emo ( in fact I was the normal kid who makes people laugh by ridiculing myself) I really liked the impression people smiling when I try to make their day less shitty. (this was when I was 14 and starting 3rd year highschool) me and my 2 friends j (jensen) T (tyson) would always walk a really long way to sit on a big overpass and just talk about what happened in our day and after that we go home and do it again the next. 

It started when my 2 sisters criticising me over ""why do you ridicule yourself, aren't you being a bit weird?"" at first I pay no mind to this since they are just asking and I just shrug them off but it started to roam inside my mind, the sentence that she gave. (note : my 2 sisters N : older sister and C : middle sister and me D ; male youngest. My sisters were top notch students and had high paying jobs and basically the breadwinners while im still here stuck in last year highschool) . 

They gradually make remarks about my personality on being a ""class clown"" and slowly calling me stupid to retarded which shocked me to the point that I can't give a reaction. And when I make some food for myself they always say to me that ""your cooking again? How much of a retarded cook can you be?"" I can't talk back to them since my parents would just side to them and just shrug it off knowing that it will happen again. 

I never talked back to my sisters and parents to which im basically a robot, listening to their needs and do their chores. The remarks slowly burned through me till I became numb to the shit talk. And in school is just the same thing but far more worse since my bully is a smart douchebag whom the teachers can't complain since he's the ""top 1 in my class"" it sucks everything sucks every time I go home with J and T I was always on the verge of crying on the edge of breaking down mentally but they were their to give me tough love which helped but they soon moved houses or went home to their province which damaged me more. 

Here is when my mind went dark after my family announced. 

I got home finished junior high and they said in a serious voice ""son you should become a soldier"" I was surprised and laughed at first but then they said ""your sisters are financially stable and we can live more comfortably now and we would want you to go to the military and when you finish, our family can have the benefits for you becoming a soldier"" I said to them I'll think about it and went on outside. 


I walked through the day mindlessly going to the over pass on which my friends used to hang out and sit on the railings thinking about jumping off. 

Imagine your whole life learning something that you want to pursue and achieve that dream only to be caught in a choice between helping your parents in a way in which you have to sacrifice that dream or pursue that dream and be shunned by family. 

I cant process any of this. It doesn't hurt, I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad im just numb my brain just feels heavy and closing my eyes helps soften the numbing that im feeling. 

Im sorry if you didn't understand some of this. English is not my first language.

SuicideWatch,"For the last few years I’ve (30F) been battling with crippling forms of depression and anxiety. I’ve seen multiple psychiatrists, psychologists, and participated in many forms of therapy. I’ve tried many different medications and various forms of treatment such as exercising, eating certain foods, meditation, etc. I’ve checked myself into psych units on multiple occasions (I have mental breakdowns every few months from exhausting treatment options and feeling suicidal) Once the thoughts of suicide become overwhelming I try to control it by putting myself in an environment where I’m constantly monitored. I have truly exhausted every route and suggestion been given to me. I’ve tried “natural” routes such as various herbs and even medical marijuana. I began reading studies of the effects of magic mushrooms on depression, all it did was make me more aware of how truly depressed I am. I studied articles and the personal experience of others for weeks before I attempted this. 

At one point I stopped eating meat because I read somewhere that if something was sad and depressed when it died that the sadness and depression could enter your own body. 

I’ve become obsessed with trying to heal my mind. I’ve never put so much effort into anything. I’m desperate to feel relief, to feel anything besides how I feel now and have felt for years. For a long time I didn’t wanna give up, the thought of my family finding me or having to plan my funeral terrifies me. 

I’ve reached a point where I don’t think I can keep holding on for them. I don’t want to keep disappointing them. I’m exhausted. I’m tired of daily panic attacks, I’m tired of pretending to be okay to friends and co-workers, I’m tired of trying different medications, I’m tired of trying talk therapy, I’m fucking tired. 

I’m going to set a date for a few months from now. (It’s very hot where I live, I fear if I’m not found right away my body will decompose much faster/smell in the heat, waiting for the cooler season seems more considerate to whomever finds me) My family is and always has been very poor. I want to save the money for my own funeral so they don’t have to worry about that. I recently moved a fair distance from my family, this comforts me that they won’t be the ones to discover me.

SuicideWatch,"I want to start by first apologizing about the fact that my grammar sucks, and that this will be long. I'm obviously using a throw away. This is stuff that I have never told anyone, not friends, Family, or even my Fiance after years of dating. 

On the outside it would seem that I have a great life, I have an awesome job and a companion who actually loves me, but I'm heavily considering ending my life. When I was a child (around 3ish?) my Father and Mother were severe drug addicts. Abuse was a normal part of life in all forms. I was beaten, drowned, and molested by both of them. I had my teeth knocked out, bones broken, and anal damage from good ole dad. My Sister who is older had it even worse. When the state finally got involved they sent dad to prison and mom went on the run for 20 years, Sis and I were split up into foster care and adopted out. I was out of the direct fire because my foster parents were actually very good people but others in our community were not. When I was around 9 i started being molested again by a woman we knew from our church. She taught me most of what I know about sex and of course at the time I didn't know how wrong it was. One of her friends also dabbled in it as well though not as often. By 13 I was having severe attitude issues which ended up with me going to a long term housing institution for troubled youth.  They flew a Christian flag but violence against the kids in their care was pretty common as was sexual abuse. It seemed like being a victim of sexual and physical abuse made me and others even bigger targets. I was finally released at 18 and did everything I could to be the best person I could, to prove that I was above all the garbage I had endured. I put myself through college, got a great job and thought I was on my way to a great life until I ruined it. I started playing an online game that's a lot like the sims but you play with other people not AIs and I ended up using a child avatar. One thing led to another and I ended up being involved in a circle of mostly women who liked to call me their ""son"" or neighbor, or some other family member and they would do all sorts of sexual stuff with me as the ""young innocent one"". At first I hated people like that and would report them but as time went on I went along with one and ended up being more turned on than I had in a long, long time, which is how I ended up in that circle of them. I want to make it clear that minors, in no way arouse me, what i found arousing was the older women who saw me as a child and did those things to and with me. I ended up getting an email from the mods of the game saying I was being invetigated for ageplay and was of course banned. Now I'm living with the horrific feeling that I have been just as evil as the sick fucks from my own childhood as well as the unbearable fear that the police will knock at any time to take me to jail for my actions and that everything will come out. Even though everyone involved was way over 18 i know some law had to be broken. I'm terrified I'm going to jail, terrified I'll have to register for the rest of my life.  Terrified I'll loose my career, my fiance, and my friends. Part of me wants to get in my car and drive until i can't anymore and abandon everything, and part of me really wants to just eat a bullet and be done with everything. Call me what you want, call me the monster that I've become, tell me how worthless I am. I just had to let it out.

SuicideWatch,"It's been years and years and years since I thought about this.  I have bipolar but been medicated for years now and everything was going great until:

1. My husband and I after 10 years is finally deciding on divorce. This isn't very ugly though! We've already been seeing other people, we agreed that this should happen, we also agree on what we both get. We've become better friends than spouses and for years we fought and fought and fought. I got blamed for everything!
2. I'm moving out on my own again, after 10 years! This is scary enough.  If you've been married for a very long time and then went out on your own, you get this. Suddenly everything is on your shoulders again and you don't have that extra help that you know you've had.
3. The man I've been seeing for about a year now is all of a sudden being a JERK! So apparently my husband texted him because he was worried about my depression. I admit I'm starting the isolation again, heavier rock music I'm listening to, etc. He wanted to see if maybe my other guy knew what was going on.  I GET BLAMED FOR MY SOON TO BE EX TEXTED HIM! OVER THAT! He said not another time, I can't and won't do it.  Like I freaking hold a gun to my soon to be ex's head and say text him!  Also he just seems distant and when I tell him what's going on lately, he doesn't really get into it ya know? He doesn't really act concerned. He says he worries about me......well then freaking talk to me about it! Ask questions!  My brain even says if ya end it maybe he would finally get the point! I know deep down he wouldn't want me to do that though.
4. My mother has dementia and after 7 years I'm still taking care of her!

I've been telling people I'm fine, I'm ok, everything is going great.....except to a very few close friends. Those friends know about the suicidal feelings, know what's going on, and 1 of them are about ready to kill both of my men.  I try to just shake it off. The other night I drank just to be happy again! I don't drink but I was at the end of my rope! I didn't care anymore and really don't.  I drank to just be happy and then eventually ya know got tired and went to bed.

SuicideWatch,"this is gonna be kind of long and ramble-y but i’ll try and put a tldr at the bottom 

i’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since i was probably 13 or 14 (currently 18m) but i always thought about suicide in the past in a negative/sad context, like i was having some sort of breakdown and i had these impulses to try and do something drastic and dangerous, and that’s what i’ve come to recognize in my head as feeling suicidal and needing to reach out for help. What i’ve been feeling recently has been different. It’s been more of an existential crisis where i’m just wondering what the point of all this is? the universe is so big and endless and we are so small, my conscious would just cease to exist and life on earth would continue. I just can’t help but feel like it’s not that big of a deal. i don’t want to go to work, i don’t have much interest in eating or my relationships or doing anything at all. This might just be influenced by this pandemic and I am still working, it’s been so stressful and playing a really big role in my mental health and stress/anxiety. it’s such a weird, simple, apathetic, tired “i could just do it and then i won’t have to go to work/deal with it anymore” 

tldr: i’m used to feeling sad when i feel suicidal, but lately i’m like an exhausted secondhand suicidal where i’m not going to actively try to commit suicide and i don’t necessarily want to die, but it’s just something that’s constantly on the front of my mind as an option, and i just feel very apathetic/empty.

SuicideWatch,"Hello, I reached out on this platform and a few other subs a couple months back. Here is my post. You can see in my post history that I posted it in several subs. I really didn’t think anyone would respond to me so I tried to put it in front of as many eyes as I could. I’ll do the same with this post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f18zg2/please_read_me_i_did_terrible_things_when_i_was_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I didn’t expect to get so much attention and replies. I am eternally grateful for the support and advice I received. And I apologize I didn’t respond to everyone. Trying to work through this gives me really bad anxiety, to the point where I tremble and vomit. 

I still hate my self and still can’t forgive my self. I feel now that my only option to move forward is I have to reach out to these girls and apologize. For the last couple of months I have been looking for them. I made a blank Facebook to try and find them, I was able to find 3 of the 4 pretty easily. For the one who I didn’t remember her name (CB), I went on a dudes Facebook who I knew befriended every person he could and looked through everyone of his 2,000 plus friends and looked at their faces to see if I could find her, and what do you know, I did. 

I will use the code names from my previous post to identify the girls. LC and CB are now married, and CB has 3 children. Also CB is an kinda a conspiracy theorist and her profile is filled with the deep state and Bill Gates is putting tracking chips in us, the works. That makes me nervous reaching out to her. LC is happily married and I’m hesitant to reach out because what if she has already moved on, and my message will bring back traumatic memories. 

Though I haven’t been able to find the 4th, DL, until I get a random call. I get robo calls but not often and no one talks to me anymore, so it’s highly unusual for me to get a call. I don’t know why but I answered this one and when she realized she called me, I could hear the anxiety and fear in her voice. And that’s when I knew it was her. It’s been over 10 years and she still has my number and I can tell what I did haunts her. For a recap she is the one who I met a dance party and while making out I put my hand in her pants without her permission. There is a lot more details about the incident in my previous post. She is also a Mormon. She is happily married with children and has become friends with some of the people I was friends with while in high school. 

Back to the call, she just said she had the wrong number and hung up. Though now that I had her phone number I was able to find her name on google and then her on Facebook. Seeing her face, I know it’s her and I’ve now got the chance to apologize to all my victims. I know I could call or text her, but I don’t feel like that is as appropriate because I’m sure my apology will be a couple thousand words and I don’t want to call because that doesn’t give me the chance to really format what I want to say. 

But I’m stuck in this step now. Every time I try to write out what I want to say my anxiety gets so bad that I shake uncontrollably. My perception is clouded with fear and self hatred. I’m afraid I can’t think rationally enough to compose a sincere apology letter.

I am so afraid that they will admit what I did traumatized them, and I don’t think I can live with my self knowing that. I have only suspected that and it was enough for me to want to put a gun to my chest. I’m also afraid that when I do they will use it as proof and oust me, which honestly I don’t want to happen, but that’s their right and I cannot object to that. If that’s what they feel like they have to do, then I have to support them. They are the victims here, not me. 

When I’m ousted I’m afraid of my friends and families reactions. I have been under the impression that if they knew the truth about what I had done they would understand why I had to kill my self. I’m also afraid that their rejection will push me over the edge of suicide. 

As of now I know I’m too much of a coward to kill my self, I’ve been there, tried that and I couldn’t do it. I love the idea and beauty of life but absolutely hate my self. I cannot continue like this or with my self if I don’t reach out. The way I’m living now is miserable, I want to move on but can’t.

I know this is about me, this is about me wanting to move forward, which is wrong and selfish. It needs to be about them, about what I did to them, how it was wrong and about apologizing to them. 

I don’t want to tell them that I am suffering because I don’t want them to feel at blame. Most of them are apart of the Mormon church and the church hasn’t always handled sexual assault and rape very well. From other Mormon rape victims testimonies, the church would rather suppress these incidents as the blame is sometimes moved to the women. 

But I also feel like if they knew how much I have suffered they would know my apology is sincere and would be more inclined to forgive me. But that right there is wrong. I feel like that is me using my suicide as a guilt trip for their more likely forgiveness. 

I am probably the most terrified that she will confirm what I had done traumatized her and caused her a lot of pain. I think that will give me the push and courage I need to actually go through with killing my self. But I don’t want to kill my self, I don’t want my life to end, but I don’t think I’ll be able to live with my self or with the rejection of my friends and family.
 
I would really appreciate any feedback or advice you can give me about how I can format it.

What my mind tells me is to try and make everything about them, not reveal any of my suffering and purely make my apology about what I did to them and how it was wrong.

But, my anxiety tells me to share my suffering with them so they understand that I am sincere and make them more likely to forgive me. But like I said earlier, that’s wrong and manipulative. 

Also, my suffering might bring them satisfaction as I have caused them trauma. But that, I would understand and be okay with that. 

But in reality, I am in no way able to think straight or rationally. My anxiety is out of control and I cannot get my self out of this depressive pit I’ve dug my self into. My existence is miserable and I don’t want to live like this anymore. That’s why I need your help and guidance.

I am a mistake, My existence is worthless.

Waking up is toture, or as close as it can be. Sleep for me is not a way to feel refreshed the next day. Rather, it is a cruel biological trick that makes me long for death itself. It is the middle ground between existence and non-existence. 

Growing up has been a bad dream. My parents losing everything because of a man who wouldn’t pay; my sister, being sexually assaulted and questioning herself endlessly, and finding that I am damned to spend decades in life. In a world so broken, and so confused that it would argue over the difference between up and down and which is better.

There is this fog that covers me everyday, while not actually something that can be seen, it can be felt. Any attempt to learn or do something new is constricted by this fog. I feel useless, I feel behind. My colleagues and friends seem like geniuses, yet I sit here struggling to absorb information. Even as I write, while I have the feelings and experiences, I can’t share them. They are trapped within me, to follow and taunt.

Many years now I have contemplated jumping out of a window, “accidentally” swallowing poison, or even hanging myself.

some things make me feel happy and giddy or whatever, but deep down i just feel like a husk. whatever emotion i have is temporary. nothing lasts forever. 

i’m never happy with how i look. my willpower to change isn’t constant, it just spikes and crashes over and over and over again. why should i even care about how i look? it’s not like there’s any point in trying to impress people

SuicideWatch,"The lowest of it.
This whole entire time, simply my existence causes suffering, and pain, and i am truly selfish for keeping myself here.
I have always looked at suicide as a duty i needed to fulfill. I knew i would have to do it, it was practically set in stone and a matter of time.
I have gotten all the help in the books, facilities to therapy to ECT, They shouldve known you cant bring a dead person back to life.
Ive always been completely alone, no acquaintances, one abusive relationship, my whole family has turned against me. As a result, i cling and get over attatched to people who want nothing to do with me.

SuicideWatch,"I wrote an analogy of how I perceive my own depression and suicidal tendencies. I hope it can resonate with some of you, you’re never alone. Happy Mental Health Awareness Month ❤️❤️:


You’re sitting in a room devoid of all color. It isn’t even black necessarily, it’s somehow darker and it suffocates you. This room doesn’t shut the fuck up either, it’s constantly yelling at you and reminding you about past mistakes and how big of a fuck up you are. You yell and pound on the walls but it’s no use. The room is inescapable. There’s one window in the room and if you look out it you see your loved ones. Some are staring at you, wondering why you’re having such trouble getting out of this room. Some completely ignore your plea for help. No one tries to break you out of this room, they just watch you in there. The world around you starts to collapse and death appears in your room with you, takes you by the hand and you disappear. Suddenly the room unlocks and everyone comes flooding in looking for you, wondering what they could’ve done to prevent this from happening. They show the love for you that you deserved when you were still in the room, but now you’re gone. Anything was worth it just to escape that room.","The Cold, Dark Room",t3_gt69wv,1

SuicideWatch,"I should preface this with the fact that while I have intense and often overwhelming suicidal ideations, I want to live so badly. I want to love so badly that it hurts deep in my soul. I’ve been suffering from depression for about... going on 12 years now. My 20th birthday was last month and I’ve been going to college at my local university, but I had a bad semester. Probably the worst rut of depression I’ve ever had without being suicidal. I just... deteriorated. I watched myself die a little more every day. Stopped eating, going to classes, bathing was a struggle, even if I turned off the light for comfort. I just wanted to... I didn’t want to die, exactly? But to just... cease. To suddenly not exist. To sleep one night and never wake up. That was the general day to day. 

My father snapped one day. Came to my college dorms and got in my face in the front office. Grabbed my shirt and smacked my hat off my head while confiscating my phone and my car keys (I paid for my own car on the by and by.) Told me I was cut off from my family. Told me that he wasn’t going to live with a son like me. 

I made a bad move after that. I didn’t realize it at the time but hindsight is 20/20. I told myself: If I’m not a part of the family anymore, then he doesn’t need any of the things left at his house that are mine. I got a buddy to drive me to my fathers house and I gathered some of the things that were important to me. An old briefcase I inherited from my grandfather and some of my clothes was really all it amounted to. 

He attacked me on sight. Grabbed me, threw me into a wall, tried to hit me. I’m proud and slightly terrified to say that I have more than I got. I’ve never been in a real fight. But I left with a busied back and beat up arms. My throat had a handprint on it. I don’t like it when people touch my neck anymore. I don’t like it when people grab me. 

I scrambled away, while my dad yelled out:
“If I see you near my house again, I’ll kill you.” 

I should have called the police. I should have done something other than just take it and run. Fast forward a year. It’s 2020 and I’m starting to get myself together again. But college is expensive and due to my rough semester I lost my honors scholarship. I can afford student housing anymore. My father house is my only option, and like an idiot, I take it. My father doesn’t hit me, but god.

I’ve never wanted to die, but I’m getting close and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m not asking for anything, I just want someone to make me feel like they understand.",Just wanted to put my words somewhere. Thank you for your time.,t3_gt6ylw,1
SuicideWatch,"Im 16
I’ve had depression for a long time, since around 6th grade. My parents have tried to “help me” but whatever they do it feels like they do it for themselves and not for me. The therapy was about family dynamic  or some other bullshit like that. I’m seriously contemplating suicide and have no clue what to do. I don’t want to die but I feel like I have no other option. Everything I do feels like i’m doing it wrong, all my friends basically ditched me and I have nothing to look forward to. I have no ideas on how to cope or help myself, I don’t feel like I can ask my parents either. Everyday I just feel so alone. This year what really made me even more depressed is quiting a sport I loved doing because I felt like I was falling behind. I loved that sport with every bone in my body and fucked it all up because of how I was feeling at the time. It’s not a sport I can get back into either, A few weeks out of it and you loose everything you worked towards. I’m not sure where to start but I just need someone to help me. This is a throwaway.",I don’t know what to do,t3_gt6r03,1
SuicideWatch,"I don't know what I am doing here. I don't want to kill myself. Not really. I love the world. There are things I want to learn. Achieve. But the thought of dying is less upsetting than the thought of going grocery shopping tomorrow. I'm not in pain. I'm just tired. 


If there is a limit to how much can a person bear in a lifetime, I feel like I am past that. Now I am comfortable saying that my childhood was messed up. If you've heard of ACEs (adverse childhood experiences), my score is 7 out of 10. I'm including it for reference. Feelings are nice and all, but a scale is a scale. But really, I've been broken over and over again.


I've believed in healing. Dedicated the past ten years to that. But I feel like I've used up everything I've been left with. The world presses and demands and I can't reach. Still I'm held back by the demons of my past. I've had opportunities. I fell apart trying to take them. My fault, certainly, at this age I should be able to live an adult's life. I just break under the strain.


Recently a lot has happened. I've had a... resurgence of a new batch of some very early memories. I've known the things happened, I just didn't remember. It's upsetting. I keep having what my therapist calls emotional flashbacks, I sometimes forget reality completely and I'm just a child alone with the terror and can't snap back. My partner was always a huge source of comfort through everything, but now he says he's unhappy. He's taken back many of our future plans that were underway. He wants us to work on the relationship. The love and affection is there, it's just the patterns we've gotten stuck in. I do want it too, I want him to be happy and it would be better for me too. I agree that there are some parts of it that are toxic to both of us. It just seems there's so little left of me.


I just want to sleep for a hundred years. But the world won't stop turning. The more I postpone things, the harder they press. I just... I don't know. I just want to have never existed... Disappear into nothingness. Sort of like when it's too much and the world stops feeling real. Even the smallest things feel like too much... 


I don't know. I want to share this and talk about it with someone who won't freak out. People are so quick to freak out over these things. I just need... someone to hold me and have him understand how much I'm currently struggling...",I don't think I have any strength left,t3_gt6qyt,1

I haven't taken care of myself for as many years.

There's no point in it if I could be dead the next month.

I'm alive through sheer procrastination.

I've believed for a long time that if something else doesn't take me, I'll end up killing myself.

My destiny lies at the end of a barrel, the edge of a blade, or the bottom of a pill bottle.

I grew up to be a statistic.

That is all I'll ever be.

I'm worthess.

I'm anxious.

I'm depressed.

And most of all,

I'm a liar.

I'm a liar to the parents who care about me. I'm their only child, they are far past their prime to have any more. If I pass, it signifies their failure. 

If I pass it's not only me who will die.

My mother said if I go she goes.

I'm trapped and I hate it.

I lie and say that I'm fine.

Things are getting better.

I'm doing well.

Lies.

Lies.

Lies.

I lie like it's second nature because mom doesn't want to hear the bad and dad just gets angry.

I know one day I just won't care anymore.

One day I'll go past all the safety nets I've set for myself and just splatter on the concrete.

I almost killed myself during a fit last month, though one of my safety nets caught me.

I don't know if it could be viewed as lucky.

I've had a decade of therapy as well.

I'm a functional member of society as a result.

I have a car.

I have a job.

I go to college.

It feels like a facade.

I'm broken and lie that I'm put together every single day.

Even on good days, I consider dying.

I imagine it frequently, at least once a day.

I feel pure happiness at the thought of being blessed with a terminal illness.

Its like seeing a puppy chase a butterfly, the feeling that thoughts of my own death bring me.

Of course, I go through the motions to protect others.

I drive safely.

I'm careful of infectious disease.

I can't let myself become so apathetic that my own want of an end endangers others.

I try to fill the time with meaningless hobbies.

I paint, I bake, I carve, I sculpt, I try to create to fill the void.

The void that is procrastination.

I will end my life one day if something else doesn't take me first.

It could be next month, next year, a decade from now.

SuicideWatch,"So I ordered a few more books, I’m currently reading “Red White &amp; Royal Blue”, a gay love story between the First Female President’s Mexican son and the Prince of England. It’s fucking great, honestly.

So basically, Alex’s (Mexican guy) divorced parents get into a fight and he calls up Henry (the Prince, duh) to tell him about it and he says that he did his best to handle the argument and then the book goes on to say;

“Alex forgets what he was going to say next.

He just... Well, he gets told he’s great a lot. He just doesn’t get told he’s good enough.”

I had a small epiphany when I read those lines. I hate it when people say “I wish I were you” or “I want to be like you”, especially since they know me an such a basic and superficial level, it’s disheartening to hear that. But now I realized one of the reasons behind that.

Nobody looks at the process behind what I make. Nobody sees me when I throw up in the mornings when I go to school because my anxiety is eating me alive. Nobody sees when I scratch my arms open from frustration when I can’t draw the way I want to. Nobody hears the way I pray to anyone who is listening to take my soul so my family doesn’t have to deal with having lost someone to suicide.

They just see the 10’s on my tests, the finished drawing I upload to the Internet and how I always say “good morning” with the best smile I have to offer.

They tell me I’m great, but not enough. I’ve been feeding people what I have to offer yet they still want more, waiting for me to get 11’s on my tests, waiting for a painting that would put DaVinci to shame. Waiting for me to be happy.

And I can’t give anything more, I try so hard that my guts are crawling up my throat with dread every time I wake up.

SuicideWatch,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t.

(She doesn't purchase her foods that are good for her situation, and only buys her sugar free sodas... which is the quickest way to kill a diabetic :/ ) As a result of this poor management, she is constantly in chronic pain. 

Through many drunken talks, she has expressed that she no longer sees any point in living, and I don't know what to do. She's told me that she has a date, and that she has a plan. 

Last night she shared with me that she makes plans with me for our future once we get out of high school and leave this POS town, but doesn't actually see herself living long enough to get there. No matter what I say, she doesn't listen. I know she's in a terrible, dark place, but I don't want to lose her. I can't lose her. 

I want her to be there when we're able to move out, I want her to be there for every milestone in our lives. None of this matters to her... she genuinely thinks she has nothing to live for. She tells me that I'm a lot smarter than her and have the ability to do a LOT of things, but she doesn't see that she does too. She hasn't even got out of high school, she has no idea how much can happen after that... 

She was diagnosed with PTSD, was about to be diagnosed with BPD and was put on heavy antidepressants following a suicide attempt. (??, I'm not sure if they were antidepressants but whatever it was made her a lot more inspired to do stuff. She got her mom and sister out of a very stressful situation, finally making her mom see that moving out of their abusive grandmother's house would be the best option for them.) 

Her mom has since pulled her out of any and all services, which has left her without the medication. Her mom doesn't believe in mental illnesses and is extremely unstable, borderline crazy. 

I'm terribly worried about her, and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help, I don't even know how to approach this situation. Anything I say proves to be useless, but I really, really want to help her...

If anyone could give me some kind of idea as to how to help, that would be amazing. I really, really think she needs to get back into the services, but I don't think her mom will EVER do that... she'd have to wait til she's 18 to get herself in, but I don't know if she can wait that long.",How to Save a Life?,t3_gt2yiu,1

SuicideWatch,"I was always the kind of kid who was in control of life, or so it seemed. By 12 I had been on TV multiple times for my fundraising activities that set records for kids lead efforts. I worked briefly as an informant for the RCMP and then CSIS after being busted for designing a new class of phone phraeaking software. I started my first company at 16 and sold it at 19, mainly because my partner had decided to move to the US. I worked a lot of different jobs as a teen trying to find my way. My teachers gave me As not to show up because they were afraid of me correcting them or making them look foolish.

I graduated highschool with excellent grades even though I held the school record for skipped classes and literally never opened a textbook.  I paid my own way through university undergrad and grad, ending up with a BA (Political Science and Public Policy), and then completed a joint LLB/MBA program. I passed the bar and obtained my CGA, and later CPA. Because of my first job I also persued and obtained my CIA and CFE. I've been an expert witness in court. After some time as an auditor I moved into lower management, and then quickly rose through the ranks spending most of my working years earning $100-150,000/year plus cooshy benefits. I even ended up a union boss for a while. All sounds good right? Everyone thought so. And for brief moments I was happy.  

It was always there in the background though. I always had to fight to be happy. I had to pretend I felt like other people did so I didn't seem odd. I would be happy and then go dead inside for no reason. I would question any source of happiness and sometimes push it away before it could betray me. I found my only joy by having a purpose. By making my company better. By improving the lives of my friends and coworkers. By having friends and family that cared about me.  

My first real live in girlfriend made me happy but I always knew she would leave me.  Maybe that came through in my actions but in the end she cheated and it ended badly.

Then I found a woman who brought me back to my heritage and I found great comfort in that. I had a child who quite to my surprise made me truly understand what it was to be happy for the first time. Combined with my daughter I actually had a year or two when everything seemed to go right, when i was finally happy for real. I started going to shule, I started working out again, i was back to the fitness of my youth and felt google. I actually believed my life would work out.  I was actually proud of who I was and I saw a future that was good.

Then it all fell apart. My marriage turned very bad quickly. I wasn't want she wanted, I was what she though she should have. The lingering doubts and depression return, my work suffered, I tried to take some sick to on my doctor's advice to straighten it out and less than a month back at work I got a new boss who fired me without cause because ""she couldn't trust someone who had gone on sick leave to lead the business"". I walked out the door crushed but with a huge golden parachute so I figured I'd land ok, I literally had years to find something.

That's when my wife filed for divorce. That's when I completely fell apart. Within 2 years I was still jobless, divorced, only seeing my daughter part time, emotionally crippled, I had lost most of my friends either because they couldn't deal with my depression or because they never were more than work acquaintances. I had also returned to the disordered eating of my life and gained 200lbs becoming morbidly obese, damaging my self confidence, my health, and my ability to present well at interviews.  

I was ready to kill myself and then I saw some stupid youtube video about a little girl saying goodbye to the daddy she lad lost to illness and I fell apart. I called my psychiatrist, told them everything, and ended up locked up. I had already undergone multiple drug treatments and been deemed ""treatment resistant"", and had undergone some unproven magnetic therapy that was in trial, still no effect. So, once they locked me up they went all out and went to electro shock therapy. It was awful. Some people feel nothing but I experienced horrid pain every time. Still i stuck with it until the day when I woke up surrounded by doctors and nurses instead of in the normal recovery room. They told me I died on the table. The psychiatrist wanted to take it up a notch and try again with dual brain electroshock (they were just doing one side) but the anesthesiologist said there was a high chance I'd die if I went under again. I was scared so I said no more electroshock. The doctor was mad and discharged me. I later found out he wrong 'dead man walking' in his notes and he said he anticipated I would follow through on my suicide within a year. In retrospect I should have let him try, I’d either be better or dead and either is better than what I am. Based on this my own psychiatrista of 2 years just quit.

Then some hope entered my life.  A psychologist who seemed to care.  I believed she cared.  I told her things I told no one.  I started to see a way out.  Then, my best friend of over 20 years betrayed me.  She admitted she had never seen me the same after seeing me in full breakdown in the hospital and seeing me at my worst she no longer thought I was a good person or a person worth being friends with.  Unfortunately she was also best friends with my psychologist (having recommended her to me) and within a couple weeks of my friend turning on me so did the doctor, refusing to see me anymore.

And then someone, maybe my ex friend, filed false allegations neglect and of physical and sexual abuse of my daughter. It took 6 months for that to go away and during that time I was afraid of every hug I gave my daughter, my only reason to live. She didn’t understand and has never been as close to me ever since.   She used to love to give me hugs and cuddles and after they are gone.  

Every single day is a struggle to live. I don’t want to die really but I can’t stand the every day pain of living. I really didn’t want to abandon my daughter though, I know how hard that is on kids so that’s my only reason to get up in the morning.   I wanted to fight for her so I got myself together and started job hunting again.  I was doing well, a couple hours every day devoted to the search.  I got a few interviews, even a few second interviews, but no job.   I was still trying though and then Covid hit.  There is NOTHING out there in my field right now.  After weeks of looking I now find myself in the worst depression I’ve been in for a long time, maybe ever.    I have no hope for the future. I see no positive outcomes as possible.  I feel like all I am is a drain on the few people I have left in my life.  I don’t even feel like a decent father anymore because we can be in the middle of something fun and then suddenly I’m blank, I feel nothing for no reason and she sees it and it upsets her.   I don’t think she believes it isn’t her causing it.  

Recently I was away from her for 3 weeks due to a covid self isolation.  She barely seemed to care.   Maybe she doesn’t need me anymore.   And if she doesn’t, its my time.   I can’t continue to live like this.  I just can’t.  My life is mostly sadness and anger broken by brief minutes of happiness when I’m with her.   It’s not enough anymore. I can’t take it.   I had buried myself in hobbies to feel like I was doing something but now none of them matter, they make me sad. I was helping others online and that gave me some joy, but more and more often I find myself getting mean to these people who are just looking for help.  I can’t control myself anymore.

I have one real friend left and I’m pretty sure she has no idea what to make of me anymore.  I love her dearly but it seems I no longer can support her I am just there to drain her emotionally because of my problems.

I feel like a coward for not being dead yet.  I know that’s my future and the longer I stay only harms others more.  In two days my baby goes back to her mom.  The stores selling balloons are open again.  I think next week may be my time.

I’m not even sure why I’m writing this beyond knowing I’ve decided goodbye notes would only harm people I love more and I guess I needed to work this through and I have no one to talk to.  I cried through most writing this and now I’m oddly calm.   I think the decision is made.

SuicideWatch,"I’ll certainly die someday, if not by suicide. Why should I live a life of suffering if I must ultimately die? I have no real friends to speak of. I’m studying something which I now realise was a mistake. I’m unattractive. I have no real skills, and I forsook the one thing I was genuinely good at to study what I thought was my passion. The virus is poised to ruin my country. I won’t amount to anything much at all, I simply have no ambition. 

Even if I did, anything I would achieve would be ridiculously insignificant when you realise how staggeringly vast the universe is. There are 200 billion + galaxies out there. The existence, or lack of existence of a single mediocre human among all that makes absolutely no difference at all to the grand scheme of things.

There are 3 main reasons which have kept me from ending my life.

Firstly, I don’t want my parents discovering my corpse. They would be utterly destroyed. Of late though, what I said above about our insignificance has been weakening this argument. What does it matter if my death devastates them? Emotions are just some chemicals. An increase in the secretion of certain chemicals in 2 individuals in the universe is immaterial. I won’t be around to see it. And yet at the same time I hate myself for being so callous about basically the only 2 people who care for me.

Secondly, I’m afraid of how uncertain death is. What happens to my consciousness after I die? Does it get transferred to some other creature? Will I perhaps have to live again? I definitely won’t have any memory about this life though, so perhaps that will act as a reboot.

Lastly, I’m afraid of botching the process. The method I choose may fail. I’m afraid of being left a cripple.

SuicideWatch,"I am a 24 years old woman and I hate my life. I regularly have suicidal thoughts. This is my story. 

When I was on kindergarden, I had no friends. The other kids hated me and bullied me frequently. 

When I was in elementary school, I had no friends. I was regularly bullied and called ugly and a witch. There must be something in my behavior that rubs people the wrong way. Also, maybe I do look like a witch. I am pretty ugly and I have black hair. 

When I was in middle school, I found 2 friends, but they were pretty trashy and often made fun of me. I wanted to impress them, so I started having sex with random men, some of them much older than me. I didn't really like the sex, I just wanted to ""prove"" something. 

My friends eventually abandoned me. I was friendless again. In high school, I only had one friend, a nerdy girl who was also a bit of an outcast, but we were never very close. We were just too different. She was a good student and a teacher's pet, while I was kind of the ""trashy girl"" with a bad reputation. 

I went to university, but I got pretty depressed because I had no close friends and no real boyfriend. I stopped attending the classes for two years and my parents got mad at me. I eventually started attending class again and I'm finishing uni soon, but I keep thinking, what's the point. There must be something seriously wrong with me. I think that at this point, even if I did find some real friends, I still wouldn't be happy. Even if I did find a boyfriend, I still wouldn't be happy.",Why I hate my life. My story.,t3_gt0ffy,1

i was discharged by a psychiatric hospital 7 days ago and after talking with my aunt, therapist, and parents, I'm flying back up to New England to go back. I've been having constant passive SI and active SI  2 or three times in the past 5 days. I feel really ashamed to have to go back after so little time, and I know it's okay to need extra support but I feel like a burden to my friends and family. Additionally, I wrote a very long thank you letter to the staff on my unit and I'm almost embarrassed to go back after having written that later, which I know is very irrational but it's still bothering me a lot.

SuicideWatch,"It's been over a week since I tried to take my life. My ex spouse called the cops on me because I was drunk and angry and she called them when I didn't respond to her message. I'm 28 and we have 3 kids together. Since I was 19 my life fell through the bottom. Made a mistake and caught myself a felony. I was in the military at the time and they gave me a general under honorable conditions article 15(discharge). I had been in for 2 and 1/2 years. Never wanted to do anything else with my life. Never cared for anything else in my life because I'm not a materialistic pig, which is how I see most people...well just about everyone.Anyway, I was put on probation for 10 years in april 2012. Ever since I was put on probation my life has been shit. It is just about impossible for me to get a job. I've applied at so many different places over the years only to be shot down in fucking flames. My entire family turned their backs on me, all my friends turned their backs on me and now my spouse has given up on me too. So now in the near future if I don't end my life I will end up homeless. CPS would never give me custody of my kids even if I was able to find a job to pay the bill. I did have a job in construction for 3 years but the car I had took a shit on me and they fired me for lack of reliable transportation.So the point of all of this is because tomorrow I am going to try to end my life again.

I was angry that that fucking bitch intervened to be 100% honest. I spent a half day at the hospital then 3 more in the psych ward.

SuicideWatch,"I am a volunteer at a suicide prevention line. I just read a post in r/unpopularopinions that said how crappy suicide prevention lines are. That opinion seemed to be pretty popular (typical for that sub). That sucks! I really want to be better and I assure you, so does everyone else staffing these lines. Do you have any suggestions on how to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my limitations:

\- The line is staffed by trained volunteers, not by mental health professionals. There are professionals on staff and they sit in the room with several volunteers while volunteers take calls. They listen in to random calls and we can call them over if we have questions or think a call is particularly acute. That way there is professional oversight while volunteers do the leg work

\- The line is not supposed to be therapy. In fact, we are discouraged from letting the conversation veer into ""therapy"" territory. The reason for this is 1) we don't want people relying on us for therapy and 2) we don't have the time or professional skills to guide someone out of the trauma space that therapy can guide you into. We do, however, refer people to therapy liberally and have all sorts of resources to help them access that.

\- There are almost always callers waiting in the queue. On one hand, it sucks to rush someone through their call. But on the other hand, other people are waiting. It's a trick to balance that. Like any public mental health agency, we are underfunded and short staffed/volunteered.

SuicideWatch,"Need to go on a little rant here about how unfair life has treated me. Both my parents were extreme alcoholics. I faced abuse growing up as a little kind almost daily. In 2nd grade my parents split up and I went to live with my mom. In the 3rd grade my mother beat me to a pretty extreme level and got arrested and went to jail. At that point in time I went to live with my grandma and father. I wasn’t behaving correctly so then I moved to my aunts and uncles in the 7th grade. In the 8th grade they accused me of stealing money that I did not do and sent me to a boarding school for almost 9 months. It was a living hell there. Fights almost everyday, I saw rape at first hand. I almost got raped but I was able to get the guy down on the ground and step my foot right on his throat and after that I really never got fucked with. That place really messed me up mentally. Finally when I made it back home I went to live with my grandma and my father. At the age of 17 I had to drop out of school to help take care of the bills around the house because my father was sick. I had lost my job and I started doing prescription fraud and got caught and was arrested. That same year I got caught with a dab pen and they sent it to a lab and I had finally recently been put on probation for it. At the end of 2017 my father had passed away from cirrhosis of the liver. Me and him became really close. He was like my best-friend and the one I always talked to and hung out with talked to and hung out late and watched movies and smoked and drank with. I was extremely close to him. It was a quick death. Happened within 2 weeks of us knowing he was sick. It has hurt me mentally a lot. That next year my mother passed away. We had started to repair our relationship so that was pretty devastating as well. Recently within the first month of my probation for my dab pen, I got charged for domestic violence because apparently me and my sister got into a fight. That means I had violated my probation so I’m probably going to go to prison soon. And worst of all my sister doesn’t give a rats ass about me. She has always disliked me because she and mom were close and when She got sent to jail she thought it was my fault when I had to go  info a hospital after she beat me.

SuicideWatch,"Long and short of it is former friends have told me they don’t care if I kill myself. That I’m evil and pathetic like my father who killed himself. That I’m a disgusting hypocrite for considering killing myself, because I resent my dad for killing himself. Well let’s test that theory. Shall we, boys? I was recently kicked out of our fraternity, and out of spite I reported the chapter for illegal behavior culminating in it being shut down. I know I shouldn’t have done that, but I was so hurt by them abandoning me. The fraternity was the only family I had left and they abandoned me. In fact the two guys I was closest to and trusted most are the ones who spearheaded the plotting and scheming to remove me. One of them (my little brother) has compared this act to being a coward Nazi who swallows cyanide to avoid judgement day. I know I hurt him by taking the fraternity from him and bringing shame to our family tree. So I get it. But that doesn’t change that he has deliberately done things that hurt me.

Since losing the fraternity I’ve self destructed. I’ve attempted to kill my self multiple times. I’ve been put on a 24 hour hold at a psych er. I’ve let physical health matters progress by delaying or completely refusing treatment (I’ve refused to schedule a surgical procedure I need basically using it as my trump card suicide method). I’ve descended into absurd levels of poly drug use. I’ve completely destroyed my life. Yesterday I lost a really good job being given the option to resign or be fired. I had gone awol and ignored my boss’s calls for awhile until HR called me.

I’ve begged these two guys to please reconsider and help me because I don’t have anyone else. They have refused. Literally telling me to go fuck myself and I’ve made my own hell. They have abandoned me, watched me lose my mind, and doubled down on the behaviors contributing to my mental decompensation.

Yesterday, after losing my job I begged them to please help me stop self destructing. My little brother’s response was:

“Well, you have certainly created your own hell and you have no one except yourself to blame for it this time around.

When people fuck up, the least they can do is clean up the mess they’ve made. Everyone fucks up. What differentiates you from the rest is that you don’t clean up the mess you’ve made, you smear it all over and do everything in your power to blame external factors for your own actions. 

I will not talk to you. I never want to talk to you regardless of if you’re alive or not. Revealing these intentions to me doesn’t help your case. That doesn’t mean your life is destroyed and that you cannot fix the damage you’ve done by doing better things with your life independent of me. People move apart and grow apart naturally or as a result of other factors, and being able to accept that is something you cannot seem to deal with. Furthermore, I don’t have respect for people who take the easy way out in life, a recurring pattern for you at this point. I can’t stop you from doing anything to yourself, nor can I stomp out your desires. But I can let you go to the grave with the thought that you’re a dark stain in my life as well as that of the chapter and all those associated with it. When it came time to face the damage, you jumped ship. What a man. I’d liken you to the Nazi pussies that bit a cyanide pill rather than see their judgement day.

You resent your father for the same thing that you intend to do and for that, you are a disgusting and selfish hypocrite.”

After I got that response from him, I sent him and the other guy I was close to (who just completely ignores me) an email totally snapping:

“It’s true that I was damaged before I met either of you. I’ve never denied that. I came to the chapter damaged, but not as a monster.

When you guys abandoned me and plotted against me for months (despite the fact I trusted you two more than anyone else in my life) you guys broke me. You shattered the foundation I had rebuilt my world on. I knew that my life was going to implode the second you guys started talking in the basement that night. That’s when I snapped and that’s when I turned into this disgusting, evil creature that I now am.

I had lost so much before I found the chapter. It replaced everything I had lost in my life. It filled every void. And it felt safe and secure until you guys took it from me rather than try to help me get better so I could be a good brother again. I didn’t just lose the chapter when you two took it from me. I lost my Huggie and my Papa and my dad all over again too. The chapter replaced them for me. And now I have nothing. And you guys didn’t care at all.

Think about how shell shocked I was the night you guys ripped the ground out from underneath me. How did you not realize how badly you were breaking me then and there? More important, how did you not care? How was I that worthless and discardable? I don’t understand why everyone treats me like I’m disposable. I’m not. I’m a real person who hurts. A lot. Not this caricature of manipulative evil that you branded me as. You guys just completely broke me and I haven’t recognized myself since that night. I literally look in the mirror and double take because I’m not sure it’s even me I’m looking at in the mirror anymore.

You guys took a damaged person and made me into a monster by destroying the last true bit of trust I held onto in the world. The way you guys attacked me and threw me under the bus without trying to intervene and help me see the light in a nonaggressive and nonthreatening way is what made me say “fuck it ,I want to see them hurt too.” If it had been literally anyone besides you two, I never would’ve reported. But it was you two. That’s what hurt me the most, not the abandonment from the chapter. But being abandoned by two guys who I considered my brothers. Who I still do consider my brothers somehow. You two were the masterminds of the whole shebang. You two made a conscious choice to abandon me and you both have admitted that to my face using the word abandoned. Nothing could have hurt me more in the world. Literally nothing. There isn’t any family I care about more than I cared about you two. And the worst part is you guys knew.

Why am I the only one who has to lie in a bed that was made? You guys could’ve stopped this so long ago if you would’ve offered emotional support and assistance on getting a collaborative treatment plan setup (sending police to the door is not at all a collaborative approach). You guys never offered to help me get treatment. Not once before it all blew up did anyone offer. All anyone did was repeatedly threaten to take away my entire life. But I was supposed to view what seemed an awful lot like attacks as help according to you guys’ world view. [name removed] got a supportive intervention from the chapter when he started to destroy his own world. I got attacked and kicked to the curb.

For months now you both have watched me descend into total insanity. And you’ve both done nothing except double down on doing the exact things that exacerbate the issues. And then you fault me for not reacting in a sane manner when I’m clearly losing my goddamn mind. Well let’s try to remember who is sane and who isn’t here. You guys are the sane ones so why do you keep doubling down on things that you know only make me lose it more? I swear you guys get a kick out of seeing me meltdown.

I never would’ve given up on you two if I saw either of you struggling to maintain a tenuous grasp on reality. Never. But you guys gave up on me. The people I thought genuinely cared about me the most gave up on me so easily. The people I factually cared about the most gave up on me.

Well fuck it. Because no matter what the two of you say, I know for a fact that it will fuck both of you up if I do it. You can deny it but the “what ifs” will always be in the back of your minds, the only way they won’t float back there for eternity and haunt you is if you’re both sociopaths and I know neither of you are.

So fuck you guys. I’m not even doing it out of fear or sadness anymore. I’m doing because I hope I haunt the fuck out of both of you. I hope it eats at you two until you’re both filled with stress ulcers from the thoughts. Undoubtedly you’ll both fair better than me as you both have access to quality mental healthcare because you both have good insurance. You guys have family that will help and support you. So good news is you both already have some leg ups that I didn’t. So you’re off to a head start there, boys.

You both could’ve stopped it but you both chose not to. You tell someone he’s evil and literally the equivalent of a Nazi coward and a pathetic failure like his father for long enough and he’ll start to internalize and accept it and act like it eventually. Especially if he’s already a broken person to begin with. I defined myself based off of what you two thought of me. I wasn’t a monster like this until you guys abandoned me. Enjoy reaping what you sowed. Especially you Brendan. I hope someone you trust dearly ignores your screams for help when your own mind starts to destroy you from the inside out. And trust me it will. I never thought I’d genuinely hope you experience the full strength of the emotional agony I live in. But in this moment I completely and totally hope you come to understand what you did to me and how you broke me.

I’m not sad or scared at this point. I’m gutted and pissed the fuck off. Fury is an apt descriptor. As you both know, sad me doesn’t act on his feelings, he covers them up with substances. Scared me makes threats and doesn’t follow through on them. Angry me follows through on what he says.

Fuck both of you. You guys don’t get to forget and move on that easy. I was promised a brotherhood that lasts for life. Not a brotherhood that lasts until it gets difficult. You guys cut and ran when the going got tough and yet you, Brendan, tell me I’m the quitter. You quit on me first.

YIT-go-fuck-yourselves. [reference to fraternity saying]”

Brendan, is my little brother in the fraternity. I would’ve taken a bullet for that guy. Still would if he’d let me back into his life, despite the plotting against me and how much he has hurt me. He’s my brother and you don’t give up on the people you love. Even if you hate them in the moment. I view him as my actual brother not my fraternity brother. He mattered more to me than my own mother (don’t get me started on her). I keep having this intrusive thought/urge to show up at his house. I know he’ll call the police. At which point I’ll either suicide by cop or blow my own brains out. I want to force him to witness the culmination of his abandonment. I want the mental image seared in his mind like the moment I found out he was the mastermind of my removal from the fraternity. I want it to haunt him and I hope he gets abandoned like me when his own mind starts to destroy him from the inside out.

A part of me says not to do this. That I do still care about these guys, especially my little brother. That no one deserves to be haunted like my dad’s suicide haunts me. Part of me says fuck them. My life is ruined because they abandoned me. And they even had admitted that they knew I would fall apart without the fraternity and they took my support system from me despite knowing it would ruin me.

I’m leaving the state for a day or two to put physical distance between my little bro and myself so that I have time to reconsider if I start driving back to execute my plan. But I know if I truly set myself to it I will go through with it.",Forcing someone to witness your death out of spite,t3_gt2atp,1

Attempted suicide at an early age, head injury, amnesia, had to start all over again. Low self esteem even though I've done some cool shit in my life.

Working in the same place for four years, just moved to a new department and had a chance to build something new. Was in a somewhat happy six month relationship. A dream project I had died recently but I was starting to overcome the loss. 
Working out, living with a roommate and about to move into an apartment I bought. 

Due to the pandemic, the relationship ended, two friends went into deep depression (one even attempted suicide) and I just fell apart. Couldn't work from home, work out, the social isolation just kicked me down. 
Pretty sure I forgot to take my antidepressants, stopped showering, shaving, eating right. Spent most of my time watching old movies, youtube (just to pass the time, not even enjoying any of it). 

Friends coworkers stopped calling, the manager still sends messages once in a while, asking how I am but I'm sure I'll get fired if this continues. 

My parents kept coming by, calling to make sure I took my pills. This morning they came by, decided they had enough and forced me to come back to thier place (my old room).

I have loose skin from losing 120 pounds and have breast with my sides sagging and stomach hanging loose. pretty much B cups. I can't wear clothes, I can't do anything normal such as swim, or exercise without my tits bouncing up and town and ending up in pain
I have arthritis in my shoulders, knee, elbows, wrists and feel immense pain daily.

SuicideWatch,"Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents. 

To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later) 

The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"". 
She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.

Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped.
Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")
Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old.
Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!)
Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams.
Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses.
Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"".
Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.

And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story. 

Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house. 
But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.

SuicideWatch,"Hey, everyone.

During these hard times of quarantine and self isolation, it is normal to get sad. That's just how human beings work, we crave for social contact. We are social animals, after all. Our brains evolved in order to live in society. But then, I realized something. I never sought for any kind of social interaction, you know. I've been living as if there were a pandemic going on for my entire life. I've been isolating myself for quite some time.

I mean, I believe I got plenty of reasons to do so, to be honest. I've always felt out of place, ever since I was a child. And as I grew older, the difference between me and other people around my age started to become bigger and bigger. People nowadays are quite superficial. They seek for superficial things, to satisfy their superficial pleasures. I have nothing against such behavior, who am I to decide what is right or wrong, after all? However, it is not a lifestyle I'm willing to follow, which is the reason why I don't have many friends. I've a got couple of them, I guess. Perhaps 3 good friends I could count on, perhaps less. There's no way to tell. All I know for sure is that I am a lonely guy, who's probably going to die alone and depressed. Pretty heavy stuff, huh?

I believe I've finally hit rock bottom. I feel like my life is bound to get worse and worse, but I can't find within myself the strength to avoid this fate. I cannot find the motivation to perform the most insignificant and simplest tasks. I cannot study, I just can't stand online classes, studying by myself, although effective, is a nightmare. For God's sake, I cannot bring myself to read books that I really, really like. I don't have the will to read a f\*cking book. I'm pathetic.

This is getting too extensive, and I don't want to be a nuisance to you all like I must be to everyone else in my life (or maybe I am too forgettable and insignificant to even be a burden to someone). To summarize: No one really likes me, and I'll likely die alone; I cannot bring myself to do anything useful, even if I like doing those things; I feel completely powerless before this situation, as if it's impossible to change my way of life.

I'd really appreciate some advice.",I think I need help...,t3_gt6gdv,1
SuicideWatch,"Hi All, 
I got a few private messages after my post and I’d like to say thanks for reaching out.
One thing that has kind of come up though that I thought might warrant a post of its own is the role that mental illness plays in suicidal ideation.
For me personally, I don’t have any mental illness. I have been to a doctor and to psychologists to check if I had developed any mental conditions which were causing me to have thoughts of suicide, and even tried antidepressants to check if it changed my thought processes. 
Turns out that although I am sad I don’t have depression. It is entirely understandable, and even expected, that someone in my situation feels sad. Unfortunately, I have lost the family and social connections and networks people normally have and since I can’t create more family or time then I am only left with working on acceptance of my situation. 
I’ve tried to be rational about it, I accept the situation and am not harbouring any delusions about the way my reality is. I have weighed up the pros and cons for me and have decided that that life just doesn’t offer any value for me into the future. That is how I have made my decision.

I’d be interested to hear if anyone else on here isn’t suffering from depression, anxiety, or other conditions. How have you reached your decision? Is it based on age, illness, boredom, financial reasons, or even just feeling like you have finished everything you want to do!",People don’t need to be mentally ill to want to end their life.,t3_gt307w,1
SuicideWatch,"I'm turning 30 in a few months. I've done enough for everyone else. Everything I love is being destroyed by covid. I wanted to travel, that was my whole life's goal. to see the world for what it was instead of just how america sees it. Now, impossible, unsafe. I have an autoimmune disorder so I've been in the house since late january when this all started. 

Food either sucks or my stomach rejects it. Sleep sucks, too many nightmares from being abused my whole life or pain from my idiot body. No friends, just people who use me when it suits them. Partner, but he's emotionally deaf to me. Job's gone, no one needs luxury industries in a pandemic. Apartment complex won't renew my lease so I'll probably be homeless as soon as they're allowed to evict people again. 

I'm in constant pain, my whole body is covered in sores that hurt and are disgusting. My joints are all fucked up. I have sex almost never and my whole job revolved around it for so long I got desensitized to it, so I can't even enjoy that anymore when i get over everything else and manage to try to do it. 

Everything that made me human has been taken from me. I wish I had done this to myself so I could at least feel like these feelings were unreasonable self hate. But honestly I've just been kicked, and kicked, and kicked, and I'm so tired of getting back up.

I left a note the gentlest way I possibly could. In a place he might never even find it, and that's ok. I'm deciding method, between a couple things, but my options are limited since I'm disabled and I might have to do something ugly. 

I don't honestly know why I'm posting here. I think maybe it's because I feel like I -need- to scream into the void one last time. I've never used reddit for anything before and I generally find it a breeding ground for bullshit. 

Everyone tells me to have hope, that things will get better. I have doctors, I have a therapist, I have people who ""take care"" of me but my life doesn't get better, it just gets worse. I can't tell if they're just not doing their job and I'm too stupid to notice or if I'm so abused I see even the worst doctor as ""hey, at least someone is even looking at my open wound"".  


Bottom line is, I want to die while I still remember who I was. Between mental illness, pain, beliefs being stripped from me, I'm slowly dwindling away and I don't like what's been left behind. I wish there was any other answer, any other escape from the constant pain, but I've tried everything. I've 100%'ed every video game I loved as a child, watched every movie that used to make me smile, read every book, listened to every scary story, hugged my dogs, tried eating good food all of which my body rejected,  but being trapped in this room for the rest of my life is too much to bear. 

I hope, whoever you are, you realize how good you have it. I hope to hug the people in your life - the only person I have to hug is someone who also slammed me into the ground in an airport parking lot. I hope you love your families, if you have them at all, because my mother raped me for 17 fucking years. I hope you enjoy a good meal once in a while, and try things you don't think you'd like, because between my 3 stomach disorders I can basically eat white rice and boiled chicken breast without severe pain. I hope you enjoy the sun, because I can't. I hope you take deep breaths, and calm yourself, because I can't.  I hope you enjoy your freedoms - knowing who you are, knowing what's going on around you, knowing what you need, and the power to change things - because I have none of those things.

SuicideWatch," Hey all. I'm going to try to be as brief and honest as I can.

I'm 17, male from swedan. I wanted to work in IT my whole life. I did an IT course last year and really disliked it, now I hate the thought of IT/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job. I quit my job in retail half way through last year, I was only working casually for some money but I had come to really, really hate it. I hated the idea of working, and I had nothing in mind for a job. In fact, I couldn't even IMAGINE a job where I would want to get out of bed and go to work, and I still can't to this day.

I started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression. It didn't do much. I upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg. This helped with anxiety, but I still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide. I tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things. Nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if I could play video games all day as a life I wouldn't be able to do it.

I'm going to be done pretty soon. I currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because I'm a student, and I have money to spend. My life is actually very great at the moment, yet I still want to commit suicide, because I'd rather feel nothing than feel negative (doesn't this seem obvious?) When school ends (in a few weeks) my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni. I am definitely not going to work, I'd rather die. I'm not going to go to uni with a student loan because I don't want to go through with it in the first place and I'm not going to force someone (the cosigner) to pay the loan back when I drop out or whatever.

So what are my options? Tolerate a life I hate or end my life. I think the answer is pretty obvious. I'm done with looking for things to improve my life, as I really doubt it's going to happen. I'm going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life.

I only have my kid here and when they are not at home I fall apart because I can only manage to keep it together when they are home, for them. I have amazing friends and an even more amazing boyfriend, but all in other countries, and I cannot see them. It's been nearly 4 months since I saw my bf, and I miss him a lot.

Nearly fell in a coma, but was rushed to hospital and they sorted me out. I know I am capable of it, but likewise I don't actually want to die, I just want things to be better. I cannot see a way to get better, or get my life into a place where it's liveable for me. I am doing everything I can, but not really getting anywhere. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for. I feel I can't open up to bf/friends/family as I don't want anyone to feel responsible if I were to off myself, and there is nothing they can do anyway since they are all so far away. I am scared to reach out to helplines or doctors here due to the fact I have a kid and they would not approve. It is a consequence that would make things a lot worse than they already are. I do get pills for depression that maybe will help at some point, but I am not very hopeful.","I'm trying so hard to fight this, but I'm not sure if I can. Don't know what to do.",t3_gt1jwg,1

* Full-time work makes me feel suicidal.
* All I think about in the past.
   * I’ve consistently thought about a specific youtuber every day from 2014 - now
   * I think about another one every day
   * I think about 3 others almost every day
   * I have an obsession with early British YouTube personalities
* All I do is think about my high school years
* I’ve been depressed and suicidal most of my life
* I don’t want to have kids because my mental health is fucked
* I peaked in high school
   * More social life
   * More purpose
   * More female attention

I want to:

* Live in the present
* Forget about the past
* Be happy

I’m thankful for the past experiences I’ve had, but I shouldn’t live there or have it dominate my present life.

SuicideWatch," 

Hey all. I'm going to try to be as brief and honest as I can.

I'm 17, male from swedan. I wanted to work in IT my whole life. I did an IT course last year and really disliked it, now I hate the thought of IT/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job. I quit my job in retail half way through last year, I was only working casually for some money but I had come to really, really hate it. I hated the idea of working, and I had nothing in mind for a job. In fact, I couldn't even IMAGINE a job where I would want to get out of bed and go to work, and I still can't to this day.

I started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression. It didn't do much. I upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg. This helped with anxiety, but I still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide. I tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things. Nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if I could play video games all day as a life I wouldn't be able to do it.

I'm going to be done pretty soon. I currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because I'm a student, and I have money to spend. My life is actually very great at the moment, yet I still want to commit suicide, because I'd rather feel nothing than feel negative (doesn't this seem obvious?) When school ends (in a few weeks) my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni. I am definitely not going to work, I'd rather die. I'm not going to go to uni with a student loan because I don't want to go through with it in the first place and I'm not going to force someone (the cosigner) to pay the loan back when I drop out or whatever.

So what are my options? Tolerate a life I hate or end my life. I think the answer is pretty obvious. I'm done with looking for things to improve my life, as I really doubt it's going to happen. I'm going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life.

University got a little better until I got raped when I was 18 and it left me with deep scars, mental trauma and harm. I suffered from anxiety, PTSD and depression, yet I kept pushing myself to keep going and maybe something in my life would be better.

Yet, this happened and sometimes I think that I brought this upon myself. That I deserve all this, because I’m a weak, selfish and insecure bastard. I don’t really deserve happiness but rather I deserve pain and suffering. I genuinely believe I deserve to suffer because I let everyone down and I just hate myself. I can’t look in mirrors because I’ll just recoil in disgust to who I see. 

When I get my punishment, I’m gonna end it. I’m gonna go to the trail near my house and end it by jumping. I deserve to die. I got nothing else left and maybe it would be better off if I just died.

I feel like the world is going to shit. Full of selfish people. I feel like even just the act of living in and of itself is selfish and evil. 
All I see in news is shit. Mindless, cruel, painful shit. Like George Floyd murder, and literal millions of other similar racist fueled hate crimes. Here where I live in Puerto Rico, 2 absolutely beautiful young women (that just so happened to be transgender) were both locked and burned alive in their own car because of 2 men that simply stated that they hated that the women were transgender. Again, along with millions of other news stories of other homophobic/transphobic hate fueled, disgusting crimes. I also have BPD and that alone might be enough for many to consider me ""evil, manipulative"" etc, and choose to avoid contact with me. I have a lot of suspected narcisissts in my family and have endured abuse, and still do endure it to this day. I feel like the world is just ruled by narcisissts and sociopaths and that any resistance or desire to change and bring positive change, is futile. I do not want to live in this nonsensical, harsh, terrible world anymore.

I plan on walking out to the mall that's right across the street after my grandparents have gone to bed tonight, and going all the way to the top floor of the parking garage. Then I shall find respite from such a senseless and morbid world in which I feel that my strong moral beliefs will never be satisfied in. I no longer care for my dreams to have a family and children and find true, genuine, unconditional love. These used to once be my biggest dreams... I think I will chase something else in the after life or whatever happens after destroying this flesh vessel. Maybe it'll just be one long empty space, of peace.

I dont plan to kill myself just yet but am very close to doing so.
Unlike other humans im not afraid to die nor will I go back on it either.

Its just that no matter what this world, this life seems to be going in cycles over and over.

They say bad things end sometime. Nothing lasts forever. Yet that can also be applied to good things too.
Nothing good lasts. In the end its just the good things that are left as memories to do what? Make you sad? ""Motivate"" you to keep living in this world people call life? This is hell.

In a world of winners there will also be losers. If I win over anything it means someone else must lose. If I lose then someone else won.
What it always comes down to is if others choose us over others or not. If we are chosen to win or not.

If you have reasons as to why someone should live please give them to be cause this trash of a world shouldnt even exist in my point of view.
This is literal hell.
Good things dont last and the bad things that always come right after them are many times worse than the good ones combined.

my sweet kitty, of five years, had to be put down suddenly yesterday for cancer that we had absolutely no idea about.

i fully expected her to come back home that day with a little bandage over her lip and some medicine for it.

i really did have hopes that it was just a granuloma but it turned out to be cancer that had spread throughout her entire left cheek. to get it removed would have meant to remove her entire lower jaw.
i was there for her during her last moments and i can't fucking stop thinking about it. she was so curious and loving even in that doctors office– looking out the window at the cars, rubbing on even the nurse's leg. i was crying the entire time and she was so sweet about it, completely oblivious to the fact that she would not live to see the next day.

i can't get the image out of my head of the pain meds making her vomit and eventually stagger across the floor and fall asleep. i can't stop thinking about the way she wobbled from the meds. she fought against them and wanted more than anything to explore, but the meds did what they had to do. it broke my fucking heart. she seemed pretty damn healthy just the week before, maybe she was skinny but she was still very active and curious, but i knew that letting the tumor grow would mean it would become impossible for her to open her mouth. she would have starved to death. i was presented with exactly three options that day, and each of them were absolutely heart-rending. so i chose the one that hurt her less.

we chose not to receive her ashes and i'm regretting that so, so much right now. i managed to find a little plushie that looks just like her in my attic, that i bought before i got her, and i would fucking kill to be able to get a little vial of her ashes to put inside the plush. i think it's too late to change my mind on that now, and i hate myself for it. i wish i knew what will happen to her precious little delicate body. i hope, whatever they do, they handle her with love and kindness.

this is pretty much the first time i've ever had to grieve for someone close to me and i have absolutely no clue what to do. every fucking thing i see reminds me of her, every place that she used to be brings me to tears. it hurts so much.

i absolutely know that she's not suffering anymore and i'm grateful for that but i can't stop thinking about her, how she loved sleeping in my room and laying outside on the patio and sitting on my lap while i played xbox. i can't stop thinking about how limp her body went once the sedatives kicked in. i can't stop thinking about how her beautiful big blue eyes stayed open even when she finally left. i can't stop thinking about the exact moment that the doctor told me, ""she's gone."" it brings me to fucking tears every time i think about it. i woke up at 6:30 today and couldn't fall back asleep because i couldn't stop thinking about her. i have no fucking clue how i'm going to fall asleep tonight. i don't want to be left alone with my thoughts. i miss her so, so much and i have no clue what to do with myself.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve been fantasizing about how I might die as of recent. I firmly believe I won’t live to reach retirement, as by then I’ll have most likely taken my life, and I take solace in that fact.

When I can’t sleep at night, I like to think about how I may take myself out of this world, whether it be the local bridge, slicing myself, or even calling the cops to shoot me. It strangely makes me happy to think about that, like a finally to a book. Is that wrong of me?

I’ve wanted to ask my therapist, but I’m too afraid of being shipped to an overpriced hospital and sinking my family in debt just to take care of me, especially considering the heavy financial burden I already put on their wallets. However I’ve been becoming more vivid in my fantasies, even imagining a realistic event that could set me off towards that road of self destruction.

SuicideWatch,"Hello everybody!

I think tomorrow (or the day after) will be my last day on this Earth. The choice of the day depends on technicalities, such as eat my favourite meal one last time, spend a last evening with my mom and buy envelopes to wrap up my goodbye letters (yet to write).

I don't care about anything anymore. I just graduated and I don't care AT ALL about what I've studied in the last years. And I have not idea what I could do instead of it... and I don't care about finding a new way of going. 

I feel so so lost and I don't care about anything or anyone. I am in a pitch black abyss, all alone.

Three fucking months of this unbearable pain and I can't take anymore. I don't want to do that job, I don't want to find another job, I don't want to do anything anymore. I want to stop breathing.

And it will eventually happen in 36/60 hours.

When everything started falling down I went to a psycotherapist that told me multiple times that the only thing I can do is go ""through"" the pain to survive, to elaborate it and to being able to move on.

But I can't. I am alone. I have only one friend, but our friendship is so superficial that whenever I try to go under the surface of my fake smiles... it ends there with her changing subject.

I have an ex boyfriend with whom I'm still friend, but he's not really helping. Of course, my dignity doesn't exist anymore and I asked him multiple times to come back with me in a relationship because I need him and he could help me that way. Also we are still fisical attracted to each other and we have a lot of fun playing/watching movies together. But his feelings for me are not the same and I feel so so rejected. In this already fragile state of mind, this rejection burns like fire on my skin.

I feel so empty, alone. I want to disappear. I want to die. 

I don't feel anything anymore... what's the point in this? I can't do anything anymore. I just want to kill myself. And I'm going to.

My psycotherapist consulted herself with a psychiatrist and I'm currently taking AD and benzos, started two weeks ago. I know that AD take a while to work... but I can't anymore.

  
The only person that tries to be by my side in every single moment is my mom. She tries and fights for me, but I am already lost. She wants to find a solution, a way out, but I see everything pitch black and there is nothing anyone can do.

My GP proposed me to recover in the psychiatric wind at the hospital, but she also said that it can hurt me more than help me, since she talked about a lot of sedation and control on my actions. What I think is that they can sedate as much as they want, but if the things in my head don't change there is nothing to do.

I don't want to live like this anymore. I've lost 10 pounds in the last month and I can't/don't want to eat anymore. The only thing I feel is this pain that I have to walk ""through"", but I can't do that.

&amp;#x200B;

So, tomorrow I'll buy the evelopes and write goodbye letters. And then I will be free.",One of my last days on Earth,t3_gsr03j,1

SuicideWatch,"Ive basically been depressed since I was 13, and didn’t get any help with it until I was around 17 and it was almost “too late” 
Along with a string full of other medical issues that contribute negatively to my personal wellbeing. 

That was 10 years ago.
And when I was a kid I thought if I was going to off myself it’d be pretty rad to go out like a rockstar and do it at age 27.

At 22 I decided I didn’t want to do that anymore, and assuming I made it that far, I would get a 27 tattoo to commemorate me not Doing That. and also because its my lucky number and my golden birthday (turned 27 on feb 27)

Well the time is now (johncenamusic dootdoododoo)
But due to the current environment I can’t get my tattoo yet. 
But thats not what I’m trying to get at right now. 

Cause I had to stop working my career of seven years, the day after my birthday and go on medical leave. 
At first it was just debilitating arthritis, but seeing a specialist its more than likely lupus. 
(Still waiting on that blood work lol) 

So I’ve been out of work, and in pain and on meds that make me feel like shit since the end of february. 
And like, my job was incredibly stressful and labor intensive (sterilization technician at a major hospital) and I thought it was going to be one of those things where I would be there until I grew old and retired, no matter how difficult or stressful the demand was. I needed that stability. I needed to make a difference. It was damn near a dream job. 

And now that I’m sick, and I don’t know for how long I’m going to be sick, and the world is sick (literally and figuratively) and everythings gone to hell in a hand basket. Its really unsettling. 
All this happened, this world changing bullshit is happening the year I once told myself I was going to Do It if things didn’t improve...
I’m not saying its karmic justice or anything, but in a sense its kind of ironic bullshit. 

I’m still here, but how I live and how the world is is rapidly changing, and its dangerous and uncertain.
And I want so bad to go back to work and to live my normal life, and I feel so bad about having a stupid fucking immune disorder that makes me unable to work.
I don’t want to have to go to work if I feel like hot wet garbage all the time. I can’t hardly hold a pen or sit down for too long because my hand will cramp and my legs will go numb. My fucking hair is falling out in clumps. Not that I care too much about my hair, its just a physical manifestation of how my illness is affecting me. 

Anyways, what I’m trying to get at is its pretty fucking funny that I stick around only to have my body and the world fall apart. 

And I know I’m not going to Cause My Death, but in a sense its a death of how I used to be.

SuicideWatch,"As I live day by day, life has brought excitement, joy, toughness, hard times and so on. That's what life is tho; we have our good times and bad times as humans. The progression of my life as a young kid started off pretty good. I grew up living that childhood of hanging out with friends outside, playing my video games of course, with my wrestling action figures, and spending time with my family. My father basically raised me most of my life, but that didnt bother me. I loved my father and he showed that he loved me aswell. 

Around the age of 10 I believe, my father got a room mate. My dad enjoyed helping people out, and the person needed help because of hard times so the nice person my father was, let him stay with us. Then things got darker in my life as my dads room mate and his girlfriend were addicted to hard drugs. I still remember everything that happened that morning I woke up. His girlfriend screaming waking my dad, myself and my cousin who spent the night over that day with us. As she is screaming ""call 911"" and as I walk into the bathroom/washroom to figure out what is going on, I see him overdosed on heroin laying in the tub. As I am the one to call 911 at the age of 10 just paranoid and scared of everything going on this moment really set a new destination in life for me. Fast forward a little bit, since this has happened, my father was forced to move out and with no where to go, he went to go live in a motel, which will come up later. 

With me forced to go live with my mom and transfer schools, I didnt really enjoy it too much. As my mom had a gambling problem and didnt really spend too much time with us kids. As all my siblings got older and slowly started moving out, I wanted to make that choice too, even tho I'm only 12, I just didnt want to live there and my mother was already deciding to move out aswell since she didnt need all that room anymore since mostly everyone was moving out. So I made the decision to go live with my father in a motel. 

Summer time before 8th grade starts, I am now living with my father. I wanted to join the foot ball team so it would give me something to do, so just in time before the deadline of join was over, I was able to get on the team. During that time, since I didnt know anyone, making friends was difficult as it required for me to have courage to talk with people. I made a few friends during this time, and honestly I met my best friend during 8th grade which will come in later aswell. So at this part of my life, it's all new to me... living in a motel, with just one bed, a small fridge, a microwave, either eating out all the time or eating small meals was what I had to deal with. It was  all new to me and something i had to get use to, as I made this decision to go live with my dad. 

As 8th grade finishes and I'm super excited for high school, cant wait to finally be that much closer of being done with school. Well, it didnt go the way I wanted it too. I really had a rough start as I was living in a rough situation with home, knowing I had to live in a motel, what my dad has to go through living in this situation aswell not being able to do much more. I really became depressed an extreme amount during highschool. 9th grade I just basically gave up, I failed a lot of classes, i wanted to make money and forget about all of the bad things happening, so I started doing drugs and selling drugs... unfortunately,  someone snitched on my friend and myself, which lead me to court and getting a probation officer and having to do community service for so long.  I had to take some drug addiction classes aswell which was part of a deal with my school in order for them to let me stay in school as they were super close of expelling me. Thankfully I did everything they wanted and I was able to stay.  But one thing that really brought me down, is my father had to have surgery, so at the age of 14, I'm sitting here having to help take care of him and my self, so during a young age I guess you could say, i had to grow up pretty quick. I would make us both food, go places where he needed me to go. Until he healed a little bit, but at the same time, he didnt heal fully. He had to have surgery on neck and just couldn't be completly how he was before so this is when he had to file for disability.  With this, money became way less than what he was making before. But, he still tried his best to get me the things I needed and always tried to have fun. I appreciate it very much of what he did. 

I finish 9th grade, failed a few classes, but I took summer school to make up for most of it. 10th grade is now here. I honestly improved a lot, but at the same time, I didnt really care about anything. Myself, school because I was just so depressed on how my life was going. I manage to pass every class, but still behind the scenes, I'm smoking weed and doing pills to help forget about the bad things going on. Still hanging out with my best friend, as we both sit there depressed talking to just keep our mind positive. Not much really happened in 10th grade that I can remember.  Well, actually there was a big thing that happened during 10th grade. I forgot that this was the year I got my license! I took my driver's ed classes and had my licenses at the age of 16! Which I was super proud of! And also, since I had my license, I went to go get my first job. I worked in a restraunt washing dishes and being a busboy for like 2 weeks and honestly I kinda hated it, so i quit. I was young and just knew that was not what I wanted to be doing. 

11th grade, another wonderful year. I thought to my self, I got to keep trying, and no failing any classes this year. Well, it didnt exactly go that way. But we will get to that in a second. So, as I'm 16 being that depressed teenager, I argue with my father all the time. We argued a lot mostly because I just wanted to have my own bedroom, a kitchen, and just have my own privacy. And living in a motel, just isnt a suitable life for a teenager. He understands, but it's hard for him to get any place to live as what happened from earlier on in life which I mentioned. I'm trying my best in school, but just not 100% as I should be. Being sad all the time minding my own business and thinking about how rough my life is doesnt make it easy to focus on school. I manage to pass almost all my classes... I failed US history which I hated...I went to summer school once again which was more time taken up doing more school work and not enjoying my summer. But it's alright, because I knew I had to do this sacrifice if I wanted to graduate. 

Summer before 12th grade, I had a problem with my spine, Scoliosis,  which is a curve in the spine. With that being said, I had to have surgery which was a big surgery. It took over 8 hours and was on my entire spine. July is when I had the surgery and I will always have that scar on my back and also it hurts like hell! 

12th grade. This is the year! Last year of highschool! I cant mess around, have to focus, get all my work done, pass every class and just live a great life afterwards! So, as this high schooler in 12 grade that is depressed of how I'm living, I wanted to beable to make a change! In order for that to happen, I would need money. So I went looking for a job, got a job at a grocery store.. . Horrible job by the way. Low pay and the work I had to do was insane.. so i worked there from September to the end of December, and also remember I go from having surgery on my spine to working my ass off 2 months later. Pushing carts, bagging food and cleaning for many hours.. larger sacrifice I took fighting through that pain. I turned 18 in November,  and I knew I needed more money, so my self had to get a manufacturing job because I knew they payed pretty good. My dad helped me get a job where he use to work and to be honest, I was making over $18 an hour as a student in highschool. That's honestly pretty good for my age of 18 and still in highschool! 

As I go to highschool, I now started my new job in the beginning of January.  The 7th to be exact of 2018 I believe. I'm going to highschool from like 7:30AM - 2PM.... then after school I basically went straight there to work which started at 2:30PM.. I wanted to make the most money I can so I worked full time.. 8 hours a day and sometimes overtime on the weekends.  I got done at 10:30PM and I did this every single day. I saved up money to help my dad pay for Bill's, and buy food. But I mostly did it so I could make a change for us. I didnt want to see my dad living in a motel or myself. February comes around, and unfortunately my dad had to have another surgery. He had to have surgery on his ankle and foot because when he was younger he broke it as a kid and it had to be looked at again... so while he had that surgery, and in the hospital,  I'm living alone... In the motel, going to school, paying the Bill's, working full time.... as you can see, I didnt get much time to my self and finding time to do my school work was hard, but I did. I tried my hardest to  get all my work done. March comes around, and my dad is in a nursing home until he heals from the surgery, and I manage to find a place to live! From the money I saved up from my job, I got a place. 2 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, it's a beautiful place and it was my first place I got on my own. Bye bye to that motel that I had to live in for almost 5 long horrible years . As I move in and slowly start buying things, and just living, I'm also excited that school is almost over so I can focus on being an adult. My dad finally gets out of the nursing home and I obviously didnt want him going back to that motel, so I let him live with me for a little bit until I help him find a new place. 

End of school is here! I passed every class, managed to get all the credits I needed! I'm graduating! I'm so excited! Also, with the end of school, I'm going to actually have more time to my self. I had to sacrifice 5 long months having almost no time to my self just so I could get to where I was. It was rough for being in highschool, but I'm happy I did. So, living in my own apartment paying my Bill's, I help my dad out, and I arranged for him to go stay with his brother because unfortunately my other uncle passed away and my uncle then had a extra room and I thought it was be nice if my dad would go live their to help out. And it was cheap aswell so my dad can save money. 

Well, I'm living on my own now. Working, coming home doing whatever I want. It is pretty pricey tho... from what I'm making and having to pay for electric, rent and water and internet and so on... It did get a little pricey but it was fine. I enjoyed how I was living. I payed every bill on time! Had amazing credit for a 18 year old. Then 19 comes around and well, I wanted to get a new vehicle. So I contacted my bank and since I had amazing credit, they gave me a $15,000 loan for a awesome reliable vehicle. It's the year 2019 and I bought a 2016 car. I was happy! Bought my own car. Before I was just borrowing my dad's vehicle to get to work. I forgot to mention that. But now this was got from me. Paying my monthly bill, insurance and keeping it well taken care of. 

Now, things are starting to get a little more expensive, as I have more Bill's, credit card, internet, gas, food, rent, utilities, phone bill, I start to realize I need to look for something cheaper.. lucky for me, my other uncle, not the one my dad is living with, but my other one had an extra room because his room mate just moved out... so he offered me to stay with him which would save me so much money! Which I took his offer. I'm living with my uncle now, and it's a whole new chapter in my life now. 

I decided I wanted to try something different. I get a new job as a construction worker. Iron worker to be exact. We built buildings with metal and stuff like that. Heights and everything. It was something new, I didnt mind it at all. Still paying all my bills, living a good life and then things start to get bad. 

I was then in a car accident. The accident was not my fault, but the other person didnt have insurance, so I got screwed over... my insurance company finished paying off my car, but I then got left with no car. This was a major disappointment as the car accident caused pain to my back more and since my back already hurt the way it was from the surgery long ago, it didnt help make it better. Added more pain. Now I have pain, no car and no way to get to work, since for my job I had to travel a lot throughout the state. So, I'm forced to quit my job. No job, pain in my back, and no car. Well, i try my best to budget my money which I did have, which was rough. I couldn't buy much, i couldn't even go anywhere basically since i have no car. My money is running low as i continue to pay my Bill's, feed my self and pay for what I need. 

I need a job, so I look for something close by, I get one. But it's not what I expected, I had to package stuff for 12 hours straight with two 15 minute breaks... its was rough, and then one day my back just gave out from working too hard. I couldn't manage doing the job, I was let go because I couldn't do it anymore. I went home crying in pain and just trying to find ways to come up with paying my Bill's, I got my paychecks from that place so it helped me pay for 2 more months... but then those 2 months went by... only way to come up with money was selling my computer. This was the hardest thing I had to do.. it was my favorite thing to do, as I enjoyed playing games, watching movies, youtube and doing everything on it. I sold it just to pay my bills... now all I have left to do is sit on my phone and sit In the dark crying of how shitty my life is. 

And on top of that, now we have this Corona virus, well, I get that 1200 dollar stimulus check which helped me out a lot! I bought a bike to get around more places and payed Bill's once again.... now I have about $350 left. Enough to pay rent for one more month. I'm sitting here going on bike rides to keep me occupied, but I cant do anything else since I have no money to do anything. There is days I dont eat because I cant afford to. But it's fine. I applied for food stamps, so I actually have like $140 a month for food. Which helps. I dont eat much so half the time I dont even use it all, but it helps in my situation. I hate that i have to get food stamps because i dont want to live off of the state, but I know I need to take care of my self and eating is a major priority.  I was always a person that never asked for help. I would rather starve a few days until I got payed before asking for money or food. 

As I sit here an pay my last little bit of money on rent... I am sitting here looking every day for a job.. within this month I have applied for atleast 15 different jobs and even called them up... but no one seems to be hiring and since I dont have a car, I only can look for jobs close by. I hate that I am limited to where I can go. I hate not having a vehicle. I miss having a job. I miss being able to have fun and leave whenever I want to just drive around! Its May of 2020... I have about $4 in my bank account just wanting to give up. 

I have a suicide letter wrote, a video for my father that has helped me the most, sleeping medication and a bunch of pills sitting In front of me just waiting until I get the courage to do it! I cant do this anymore. I cant live knowing I cant AFFORD to live. The fact that I have literally 3 days to either get a job or get my rent, i feel like it's impossible. I wish my life would have gone different and I wish I would have never had that damn car accident! I would still be working, having a vehicle, paying my Bill's, saving money living a great life. But one thing, screws everything up. Sad how my life just went from happy to dead Inside from one tragedy.  

I'm sorry, this isnt everything that has been going on, but I tried to summarize it the best I can and I wanted to just share my story. I've neve told anyone about my story and if I decide to get that courage to end it all and stop this suffering, I might aswell share it somewhere. I'm not the greatest writer as I just threw this together randomly. Not really the best structuring , but I just typed whatever came to mind. 

I appreciate you reading if you did read it all. I know it's long and boring, but this is my life. This is my struggle and the only way to stop it and feel better is if I felt nothing at all. My life is too hard to fix. I'm broken. I cry every night, just wishing it would get better. Praying for a call back from a job, but no calls. Praying for a miracle to happen. It's been too long living like this an i just dont know if I can do it anymore. My rent is due by June 1st, but hey, my 25,000 life insurance will beable to cover the funeral and also pay the rent I owe. And then the rest can go to my father and hope he enjoys it as i love him very much and could never repay him for everything he has done for me. Thank you dad. 

Thank you everyone for reading. Sorry if there is any grammar mistakes, but this is my story. I'm 20 years old, my name is Nathan, and it was a pleasure sharing this with you all. My time is coming to a end soon tho, I hope you all have an amazing life tho. Have a beautiful day!",I've let everyone down including myself.,t3_gsrpjv,1

SuicideWatch,"I’m scared of how many times I thought about suicide yesterday. 
Can I give you some background to my current situation (since March 15)? I have been working full time while also taking care of my toddler. He is almost 17 months old. 
It’s an impossible task to work full time and try to take care of my LO. if you have no concept of this, set a timer for 20 mins to go off for the next 13 hours. But the timer also needs to go off at 5, 7, and 10 min intervals because the wrong video is on, the food is now cold, I want this thing I can’t have, I want your undivided attention, teething, time for a nap, etc etc. 
I worked for 5 weeks, started having debilitating panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. (I have anxiety and depression but it has been in check outside of this pandemic). 
I took 3 weeks off of work. Panic attacks stopped almost immediately, suicidal thoughts gone. I felt like a great mom and wife while I was off. It was magical in comparison. 

I started back at work 2 weeks ago and I’m already back to panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. The workload is INSANE. Even in office this workload would be nuts, but obviously more manageable. I work with clients on the issues they have with a web application we offer. The work sits in my head like a building timer and then the sensory overload of my teething toddler screaming just makes me snap into a panic attack. He’s cutting his 5th tooth since 03/15. 
The daycare (through my work) has given us no indication of a re-open date. Then someone delivered via the grapevine that the daycare may not be reopening at ALL as our company was recently acquired by a new larger company, new company “doesn’t want to take on the cost of the daycare”. 


I really scared myself yesterday. It’s never felt so real.. 
There I was, hiding in my shower, crying, googling the Suicide prevention hotline. 
I wouldn’t call it because, well, fear and shame. Would cops show up until someone came to get my son and they cart me off to my local mental health facility? Would I always be labeled with this tag of someone who can’t be trusted to take care of their own child? My kid can’t even sleep at night without me how am I supposed to just abandon him?

Should I have called that line? What do I do? I can’t keep on at this rate, I am genuinely scared of what could come from this. 

I could quit my job, theoretically... isn’t that a horrible idea considering I should be thankful I have a job with so many millions of Americans out of work? 
I can ask for more time off, I know I NEED to do this, but there is some stupid nagging voice in my head that is afraid to. I need to just tell my boss that I’m back here...

SuicideWatch,"Everytime I read a post about someone wanting to kill themselves ,there's always someone talking about ""what about the people who love and care for you?"", and honestly, it makes me feel awful because I have no one. 

This is not because I'm sick and can't recognize the people around me that actually care about me. I legitimately have no one.

This makes me want to disappear even more. How come I have no one? What kind of human being has no one?  Supposedly every person has at least one person to care about them.

When I was growing up I thought to myself that it was ok, I could manage being alone and that it wasn't as bad as it seems, but honestly, as I grew older I noticed that life is unbearable when you're alone.

Sometimes I really wish I at least believed in god, because maybe I could find some comfort in faith.
For what I've seen, people that believe in god have hope that things will get better, that everything happens for a reason and that every human being exists for a reason.

What bothers me the most is that I don't even have the right to choose what to do with my own existence. People should be able to decide and die with dignity, like in euthanasia.

She is currently in the psych ward and says she’s mad she didn’t take more pills and end it.

The suicide note she left us says she’s been hurting for over 10 years and cannot take the pain and misery of life and wants to at peace in death.

We, my family, know she struggles with anxiety and depression and have tried to support her in every way and find her help.

I’m lost as to what to do. I want her to find relief from her pain, but in life. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? I do not know what to do anymore..

I love my sister and I don’t want to lose her",My sisters second attempt,t3_gsncx9,1
SuicideWatch,"Ok now I’m really struggling. With all the riots going on I’m nearly done with humanity. I’ve been looking through twitter to see so many people say all cops no matter what are evil and I’m trying to stay convinced that it’s not all of them because I’m trying to see the good in at least some people but I’m starting to give up. I think I’m even starting to hate cops too. Regardless of whatever ya’lls opinions are, I’ve almost lost all of my humanity. I only have a few ounces of it left. I need help before I can’t even break free and possibly cause awful things. I just need the right person to talk to. I can’t talk to a hotline because they might send people over and I don’t need that. I just need to vent.",Giving up on humanity?,t3_gsugf4,1
SuicideWatch,"I’ve made a crap ton of mistakes in my life, I lied a LOT. Most of those just to make people feel bad for me or whatever. I guess I just wanted the comfort then, someone to agree with me. I have a mother which I hate maybe more than myself, a family that doesn’t care, a horrid attitude, one disgusting face (luckily it’s clean, but still overall ugly) and I’m dumb. I wanna kill myself, but like many others, I’m scared of it. I also just wanna take the piss outta my mom who is completely fine with me dying (perhaps because I make her feel too incompetent, not my fault you’re a bad parent and worse at the internet). And to top it all off, I’ve made the maybe horrible decision to cut off all my irl friends. I don’t think I’ll be able to make any online ones either cause not only do I value keeping my info safe a LOT, i’m also bad at making friends (surprise surprise, the suicidal good for nothing can’t make friends). So I’m just stuck in a pit of suffering. You don’t really need to comment, I just feel a bit happier knowing someone knows about how crappy everything in my life is (myself included). But on a lighter note I do have a fairly good way of life. I will admit by some miracle my grades are good, however in the real world I’d be utterly useless. I have a decent housing situation. I live in one of those fancy villages with gates everywhere and all those big homes and mansions, in general I would say we are quite lucky to be in the upper middle class where I live. So I also feel it would kind of be a waste to commit suicide. Like when you have all this great loot on your save in a game and all these buffs.

SuicideWatch,"my boyfriend went behind my back to talk to girls on onlyfans and cam sites after I told him when we started dating that I considered it cheating. as far as I know he has been doing it since we started dating.

he promised he'd never do it again, and I believe that he believes that, but I'm scared that in the future he'll fall back into those habits. I can't trust him anymore. every time he's gone at work I can't stop thinking about him getting off to those girls and thinking of being with them instead of me.

I'm too scared to go back to inpatient because I feel like he's just going to do it all again because I won't be able to have sex with him or keep an eye on him while I'm gone.

I can't do it anymore, but I also can't live without him in my life, so I plan to take my life before the end of the year.

SuicideWatch,"Long story short I was laid off. I'm interviewing for a new job but I am having a really tough time believing I will get it. I don't really see any hope for myself finding any kind of inner peace or having a future worth living, either in my personal life or career.

My wife, my therapist, friends, anyone I seem to talk t about wanting to kill myself immediately jumps to my guns. I have several guns, they are my only real hobby and sometimes they make me feel happy. Yes, it is possible I would kill myself with them, but they are the only material possessions that really matter to me.

Their first instinct is asking me about the guns, demanding I get rid of them or send them somewhere else. I'm terrified someone is going to call the police and have them intervene, at which point I'll lose my gun rights and that would really send me over the edge. It's also one of the only things keeping me from making an attempt- I know if I botched it I would lose my guns for good.

Is there any resource, any phone line in the US where I can talk to somebody who absolutely will not try to call the police or lecture me about my hobbies? I am feeling really strong urges to kill myself and it is NOT ABOUT MY GUNS.

SuicideWatch,"It seems the typical situation for people wanting to kill themselves is that they're sad and their life is a struggle and they want the pain to end. But why does it feel like sometimes my thoughts on wanting to kill myself are more on impulse. Like the intrusive thoughts that tell you to touch the hot stove or drop your phone down the center of a staircase. You don't want to be injured, just your brain is bored or something and touching the thing that will injure you seems fun I guess? Or not fun, but at least end the boredom or something? But like I was out on a walk today and I was walking across a bridge and there was a sign that said no diving off the bridge because it was dangerous. And then it's like, great, now I have to fight against my brain not to climb over the railing and jump into the river below and most likely injure myself and possibly drown, just because the idea was put in my head. Did I want to die in that moment? Not particularly. It just seemed like fun I guess? The thought was even accompanied by a sense of excitement? Part of me feels like there's something really wrong with me but another feels like I'm perfectly fine. And I feel like I should mention this to a doctor or something but I'm also convinced they won't take me seriously? And like I don't take myself seriously? I mean, I've dealt with this for so long clearly I must not be at any actual risk or I would have died long ago? I can't even figure out how to tell my doctors that I don't think i actually have depression and that it feels like something else, how am I supposed to describe feeling this messed up in the head. I'm just worried that anytime I try to bring up a mental health concern it will just get brushed aside. Am I crazy? Do I need help? I'm mostly just distressed that part of my brain wants me to randomly do dangerous stuff like this, and also that I can't even do depression and suicidal ideation correctly because I'm too happy for them.

SuicideWatch,"For the past 5 years I've been extremely alone and isolated.  My life totally fell apart and within the last 3 years I've contemplated suicide a lot.  Thing is, I'm 17 and want to live a full happy life but I'm so pinned and trapped that its seeming like suicide is my only option.  The past 3 weeks have been crazy difficult.

SuicideWatch,"I never thought I would be posting here. 

I have suffered and struggled with depression and anxiety for years over several periods in response to various issues and events. I came very close to taking my own life a few years ago but something turned me around, and I was able to see that my situation and the associated feelings may pass. And they did. I have even been able to talk openly with my family about my feelings relating to suicide, and I was able to tell them that in the event of any future episodes of loss of hope, I might just be able to stay positive, and only a major physical ailment would cause me to consider ending my life.

And sadly, thats where I am now. For reasons which cannot be ascertained, my face is becoming deformed. I suffered a minor disorder in my teens which left me with a mild asymmetry. It was able to be partially resolved with a couple of surgeries, and my life went pretty well. Not perfect by any means, but I was happy to be alive, and I know that made me lucky. My asymmetry didn't hold me back and I think that as I grew into my face it was barely noticeable. A couple of people had mentioned it over the years in an attempt to hurt me, but the fact that they would use something like that against me meant that they weren't the kind of people who held opinions that I valued. It seemed like a weak, cheap insult and made me feel more sorry for them than for me. 

Since last year something started happening to my face. First the changes were small. I could only feel them while washing my face in the shower. Nothing was visible. But following an incredible burst of growth and change in the last three or four months I am left with a huge asymmetry affecting the upper part of my face and my skull in general - in particular one of my eyes and the surrounding area. I don’t want to give details, but one side of my face and head is ballooning out in all directions. Everything is becoming crooked and twisted and as much as I wish this was in my imagination, it isn't. My concerns have been validated by medics and close family.

A scan has shown no reason for it. The symptoms and progression don’t match any of the obvious conditions which could lead to this. In fact, due to the fact that this could be seen as a reoccurrence of an earlier, long dormant issue, there is speculation that ""this could just be the way you are"". Covid means that because this isn't a malignant issue such as cancer, there's no other diagnostic route to take at the moment. But I have already run out of time. This needed to be stopped three months ago. 

The speed of progression from what I considered to be normal to where I am now has been horrific. Just a few months ago my face was mine, and it wasn't perfect but I loved it. Since then each day has brought incredible physical and emotional pain, and alongside that pain has come growth which has elongated the bones and pushed my face into a place that it shouldn't be. It has also affected my jaw severely and the function is becoming increasingly compromised. 

I have lost count of the number of photos and videos which I took to mark the progression. But I can scan through them randomly and pick out exactly when they were taken just by the shape of my face, and the extent of the disfigurement. 

My feelings started with ""maybe I am imagining this"", moved to ""well, this is happening but maybe it will stop or a cause will be found"", and I am currently at “this is inconceivable. Nobody can help me, and at this rate within two months I will be blind and unable to leave the house"". 

I am already at a point where I consider the level of disfigurement to be beyond what I can cope with. It has reached the stage where people will notice even if they aren't directly interacting with me. I am in a state of complete despair. Where I was able to see hope in the past, I see only the potential for more upset, more pain, and further loss of function. The magnitude and location of the issue means that it cannot be corrected. So each night I go to sleep knowing that today was the best I will ever look, and tomorrow will be a little worse.

The pain is almost constant. Pain itself can be alleviated a little by medication. But I know that the pain over the last few months has signified new growth, so it is reasonable to assume that continued pain means that its still happening. The fear that this brings me is indescribable. 

The time for looking at carefully angled photos and videos ended a week ago and my mind is beginning to adapt in a rather matter-of-fact way to the reality that I will spend the rest of my life in torment and pain, and the only thing which I have control over is what ""the rest of my life"" really means.

I have had tearful conversations with my mother and my sister to explain to them that I will be ending my life, and that the time will be soon. They are of course devastated. I had agreed with my mother that any final plans would be deferred until after the results of the scan, and she was right to force me to do so. I guess there was a chance that a cause may have been found for my condition. Even if the cause had itself been horrific, at least I could have blamed something for my condition. As it stands I have no idea whats happening to me. I think my mother and sister shared my hope that a cause and maybe a solution would be found. My mother says she understands my wish to end my life. We will see whether that is really the case. My sister does not. And I respect her for that. 

The absence of a root cause is bewildering, and the speed at which the changes are occurring is like nothing else I can find described anywhere online. The fact that this is happening during the isolation imposed by the Covid situation, at a time in my life where a lot of positive career and personal changes were just around the corner, and that this involves what has always been my greatest fear - facial disfigurement - makes me feel like I am in a nightmare designed especially for me.

I have told a few friends and colleagues that I have some issues with my jaw and some associated problems with my face. But thats all. I haven’t seen them due to the Covid lockdown, and working from home means I have been relatively isolated from everyone that knows me. If this affected any other part of me then I would tell them everything. And I know that if this was anywhere else on my body then I would be able to deal with it. But because it affects my face I feel a great deal of shame and embarrassment. 

My emotions about death are so confusing to me, but I can just about rationalise them. I feel justified that I will end my life, but at the same time I’m so sad that this is how things will end for me. Of all of the ways that my story could have gone this was one of the most unlikely and upsetting outcomes that I could have imagined. I have loved my life, and I wish that it could go on for a bit longer. I didn't know that I was going to have so little time. Even just another few months without this burden would bring me so much joy. 

I know that other people go through and live through so much worse. But I have reached the hard limit that I defined so clearly in my head a long time ago, and I just don't have the strength to get through this. What was a hypothetical worst case scenario has become real, and that reality is much worse than I could have imagined. 

I can’t even watch TV without feeling hurt. Everyone that I see on screen feels me with jealousy and sadness, because they are “normal”. They probably take it for granted, and that’s understandable. My previous experiences with being facially different meant that I never took it for granted. I always felt lucky for what I had. I wasn’t good looking, but I was really close to normal after my surgeries, and that counted for so much considering how I felt when I went through my earlier issues. If I watch a show or a movie that I have seen before, I remember that I was normal the last time I saw it. If I even reminisce about a happier time of my life it always ends up with me thinking about how normal i was back then. My situation is inescapable and thoughts of it consume every waking moment of my existence. 

So now I am faced with the harsh realities of finalising my last weeks or months. Closing down my affairs and finances, and performing the real life equivalent of deleting my internet history. 

At this exact moment I am a coward, and the prospect of actually killing myself fills me with fear. I live in a nation where firearms are rare, assisted suicide is illegal, and the availability of drugs which are useful in suicide is strictly controlled. Any overdose attempt now would be speculative and far from guaranteed. But I feel that the coming weeks will resolve these issues. Each day I feel a greater need to die, and as my pain and discomfort increases then so will the strength of my medications. Once I get hold of the powerful stuff then that will be my prompt to act. This will be much later than I would have hoped, as the desired time has already passed. But other methods of ending my life would be much more unpleasant, and my key concern is that I cause the minimum of distress to others. I know that the act itself will cause pain to so many people, but I hope that in time they will understand why I chose to die. 

I’m sorry for such a long post. Writing it has brought me immeasurable sadness, but at the same time it has aligned a lot of my thoughts. These aren’t feelings which I can share with anyone close to me, but I just wanted someone to know how I am feeling, even if I’m just an anonymous throwaway account on Reddit.

All of us have an infinite capacity for the most perverse forms of evil and little to no capacity for doing anything objectively good, and even when we do good things it’s just to give ourselves a pat on the back. No one chooses to do good for its own sake. People do care, but it’s a mute point since it’s virtually always for the wrong reasons. You think I’m wrong? Go ahead and give me your best shot.

SuicideWatch,"TL;DR Below! 

Just as the title says, I'm finally cleaning my room. It's been years since I last cleaned my room, and the amount of junk in my room made it so I couldn't even see the floor. I just got so depressed I couldn't even get up to go throw all my shit away.

Underneath my bed is the worst, and the part I'm tackling currently. Glass bottles, plates, cups, packets of things etc. I always felt like I was being lazy, and beat myself up for it, but it was just depression. Just pure sadness and discomfort.

I've stored all my important things on my shelves, and taken out all the boxes I've been hoarding. I'm happy. For once.

Honestly, if you guys are dealing with depression to the point where you're living in mess, please, if anything, perhaps you could clean your bed? I know having a fresh bed free of packets and old boxes really elevated my mood and helped me sleep at night. 

I know this may not be much to some people, but I was just in awe of how happy I've been lately just because I've finally reclaimed my room as my own. I'm still struggling every day with my body image and my own mental health issues, but this is a step! I always encourage steps in the right direction. 

TL;DR I cleaned my room from old plates, bottles, cups, and packets. I'm finally free, and I'm feeling so much happier knowing I have a safe place in my house to go to when I need to escape, rather than seeing my room as a jail.",I'm finally cleaning my room after years.

SuicideWatch,"I just want the noise in my head to stop. It's a constant cycle between being overstimulated and dissociating. I'm 30yrs old and so exhausted from waking up stuck inside of this head. I'm ready to complete what I've been thinking about for years. I have the belt and the state park is open again. I've attempted many times but I know, for certain reasons, that this time won't be difficult.

A few weeks ago someone that I used to call my best friend for 14 years died when he crashed his car into a ditch while driving drunk(it was single vehicle accident). He was intelligent, talented and had the biggest heart. I couldn't stop thinking about how he was alone when this happened. I can't stop thinking about his smile and the way he laughed.

And then yesterday, I find out that someone else I've known for about 10yrs died. He died by suicide. This has hit me a like a ton of bricks. Every time that I hear of someone dying by suicide, it feels like someone punched me in the face....  This friend has a young daughter and so many people that cared about him. I know how painful it is to feel so isolated with thoughts of wanting to die. He shouldn't have been alone.

I cut my arm up pretty bad yesterday. For the past 8 months I've been cutting every week as opposed to every month or so like I had been doing for years. I don't know how else to calm myself down. I use other coping skills but self-harm seems to be the most effective and quick release of all the anxiety and deep sadness.

I hate making this about me but my first thoughts when I heard about these friend's deaths were: It should've been me. I'm the one who should be gone.

I'll be going to the woods in a couple days or so to drown out the noise.... I hope. Sometimes what stops me is the adrenaline rush that I get when I start wheezing and I feel pinpricks in my hands. I get images of what my decaying body will look like when someone finds me. I think about the insects and animals feeding on my corpse. I think about my sister and how far she's come after struggling with alcoholism and depression for so long. I think about my roommates and my other close friend that lives states away from me now. I think about much this will destroy them and just hope to ""god"" that they will grieve and move on as quickly as possible.

Seriously, if you don’t know what it is, it’s a new visual from season 4 of Attack On Titan, a Japanese anime. While that might sound ridiculous to you that some Japanese cartoon is the reason I’m not ending it yet, let me explain.

I discovered this show as my 15 year old brain was at the main stage of development. The themes in this show influenced me so much that I still carry them to this day, which is probably why I haven’t ended my life yet.

It deals with themes of living in a cruel, merciless world where everything and everyone hates you and wants you dead, but pushing forward and fighting anyways to achieve the freedom that has been rightfully yours since the day you were born, no matter how many times the world may try to take that from you.

It’s not some sugar coated “Just enjoy the small things in life uwu” or “If you just eat healthy, exercise and work hard, you’ll be 100% better by the end of it!” This anime doesn’t baby you. It’s upfront and real about how there’s a chance that your worst fears may come true, and that everything you’ve worked towards up to this point is utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Yet, you can choose to demonstrate your inner strength by choosing to move forward anyway. No matter how many dreams of yours are crushed.

SSRIs only made extremely apathetic and emotionally blunted but at the same time didn't help my anxiety at all - not even 1%. Vortioxetine was the same plus it gave me horrible stomach pain. Mirtazapine was the same, but also made me extremely lethargic. Wellbutrin at least helps a little with the amotivation and apathy, but it makes the anxiety a little worse as well.

I’m super fucking upset and want to just die. It doesn’t help I have borderline personality disorder and it doesn’t help that I live where I do. I’m always going to be criticized for it. I’m always going to be judged for it. My fucking opinion doesn’t matter. My voice doesn’t matter. No matter what I say and do or DONT say and do, I’m the fucking bad guy. I used to keep my opinions completely to myself. I used to just not say anything or take part. The only living breathing being that used to know my opinions was my dog, because I cannot fucking trust people. I wouldn’t even vote, for fear of judgement. That’s what 13 years of dictatorial and evil bitch parent does to a person.

My opinion doesn’t matter. I don’t matter. My actions don’t even matter. I’m the kid of a cop and I’m pretty sure there’s people out there who are hating on me wishing I was dead.

I’m not a fucking racist or any of those other things but apparently I am by implication and association. My dad isn’t any of those things either. I tried to stand up for the fact that my dad doesn’t fucking suck. And I got hate.


And I bet people would laugh and sing and dance if “the racist cops kid” killed himself. People would be actually happy that “one less racist” existed.

I’m living at home with my family now with a toxic relationship with my mom. I feel horrible and disgustingly privileged to be even thinking about suicide. I haven’t seen sunlight in 2 months because of trying to keep my mom’s anxiety about COVID at bay. I wanted 2020 to be the year I finally curb my depression, to start out the new decade strong. I’ve always had “high-functioning” depression. No one can ever tell except for how much I cry on a regular basis. I told my parents I need to get on antidepressants because I’m scared of my thoughts. I don’t want to worry my boyfriend or any of my friends, so here I am on reddit. Growing up, I was always too scared to do lasting damage so I would just punch my legs or scratch myself with led pencils.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve been dreaming, imagining how i’m going to kill myself. Whenever i think about this, i feel a sense of calm, finally a place i can rest and all my problems will be gone. Imagine it like you’re driving a car, and the car keep getting faster and faster and you want it to slow down but you don’t know how. You only know that suicide is the break, a pedal that u can press but you car will stop forever. 

I think about what happens after i die, my body, atoms, will return back to nature. The universe will continue normally just like before i was born. I know it’s wrong but in a way i look at suicide as a beautiful thing. Someone, who has been suffering, freed from their pain, resting in peace. 

It feels calm as i stand at the roof. But at the same time i’m too scared to go nearer to the edge. I’m afraid i might actually do it and jump. It tells me that deep down, i know i want to live. As i have these thoughts, i can’t help but feel selfish. I ask myself, “well if you’re so suicidal why don’t you commit suicide now? Don’t undermine the people who actually committed suicide, you didn’t suffer as much as them. You would be so selfish if you committed suicide. You will burden your family and friends with the pain”

Life is beautiful. It’s not just about constantly being happy. The pain, the hardships and not knowing everything is what makes life special. The mystery is beautiful. We fail and we fail but we have hope, goals that we want to achieve and we continue to try no matter how hard it gets. We have faith.

But as I constantly try to move on with life, the more i realise, there is no place for me here. It seems like i simply am not capable of finding anything here. It seems dark, and whenever i run from it and see some light, the huge darkness will always catch up.","I don’t want help to make my life better, i want it to end",t3_gsf6ev,1

My OCD, although it never gave me problems before, has started providing intrusive thoughts that make me want to rip out my own brain. They make me want to vomit. They make me physically recoil. And they come out of nowhere. It spirals me into a pit of despair I don’t know how to climb out of and I don’t know how to escape them or prevent them. 

Everything is so, so pointless. It all means nothing. What’s the point? There isn’t one. I found myself in the bathroom getting ready for bed and my brain starting wondering about ways I could actually just end it. Just make it stop. I probably never could, I have people I love with my whole heart who I could never do that too. But it was in my head. How I could just end it. How it would probably hurt but at least I’d be feeling something again until I finally, genuinely felt nothing ever again.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve always thought about if I wasn’t here anymore but I’ve always convinced myself it would be better if I just kept going. However until recently I found myself with different answer. Why shouldn’t I do it? Some background: I’m 18 years old dropped out of high school. I’ve had many friends in my life but never for very long. At least not to the point I would consider them people I truly trust. The only friend I’ve ever had that I hold dear was actually someone I’ve never met. I’ve always been there for him but I recently ended it because he was never there for me when I needed him and honestly he’s made me wish he was dead. But that’s not the point. 

I’ve never been able to keep a real life relationship that wasn’t my parents. People say they like me and enjoy my company and I don’t doubt that, but only they like me because I put on a mask about my interests and emotions, so it’s never really me. When I do show my feeling and interests I become an invisible blob that people would rather ignore. 

I’ve tried to get help from talking about people but I can’t even get proper face to face therapy because of my location. The only time I actually got real help was for a very short period of time when a psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar, Depression, and Generalized anxiety disorder while feeding me pills that made me fat and tired but I still felt exactly the same. I eventually stopped seeing her because I felt like she didn’t really care about what I was telling her. Actually a big factor to why I never finished school is because they kept telling me my problems were not a big deal and they really didn’t care about what I had to say. Maybe my problems are not a big deal? I didn’t care and I could barely get through the day without destroying my mental health in the process so I decided that I would quit. But even then the relief was temporary. After I quit school I set out a plan with goals for getting a job, exercising, meet new people, maybe finally get a girlfriend. I was truly happy and relieved and all of the sudden I was back to square one with a global pandemic basically shutting down the whole fucking planet. The worst part is I started having kidney/bladder issues that I don’t understand. 

I’ve been so angry and just yesterday I though to myself “if I was to kill myself I wouldn’t have to deal with any of that anymore” I know my problems are laughable at worst but I can’t but feel like my life will never have any kind of normalcy. 

The only people that would probably even know I died would be parents since I have literally no more friends in real life or on the internet. 


There goes it. If kill myself at least I posted this beforehand. I’m still going to think about it but I think my mind is made up. I’ve got no achievements and if I did it wouldn’t matter because I have nobody to share them with.

I had originally planned to reapply to uni since I dropped out but now the deadline is in just over a month and I've not even started my application, and don't think I will, because I don't see the point or can envision a future where it happens and I just don't know how to even start again. I've also just stopped enjoying and doing so many things, I used to have multiple hobbies and things that made me happy, and now nothing makes me happy anymore, infact nothing makes me feel anything in the slightest bit of REAL positive emotion anymore, I only ever experience a flatline of nothing, or negative emotions, and all I do all day is either sleep, play games, or literally do nothing because I haven't got the energy or desire to do more. I've also just stopped speaking to so many people, part of me believes it's because our friendships were meaningless and toxic which is for the greater good but the other part of me just believes it's because I don't have what it takes to engage in friendships anymore as it's exhausting, I literally talk to about 3 people regularly... Which leads to my next point, I only talk to people I know online. The thought of actually meeting my friends makes me feel so uncomfortable and I have ZERO desire and will to be able to do so. I don't know why, I really don't, I think it's just because socialising makes me dissociate and anxious and hyper-aware and exhausted.

SuicideWatch,"Hi 

Just wrote out a massive post that took about and hour to write and ended up accidentally refreshing rather than posting and I cba writing my story again so here's the tldr version.

Took an overdose alongside 1litre of whiskey, ended up drunkenly leaving flat and someone called ambulance so was saved there. 

Took another overdose 60 X 500mg paracetamol, had nausea for first few hours then pain for next few days then nothing I just went back to normal.

I know that paracetamol is a horrible way to go but at the time I had not done any research and had no access to any other method.

My research now shows that 12 g can be fatal yet when I took 30g I just went back to normal after a few days. I wouldn't say I'm young (around 30) and I wouldn't say I'm healthy either. 

While I'm not planning to use this method again I am still curious as to why it wasn't fatal the second time when I wasnt treated for it.

Anyone have any ideas?

This is the first time I’ve ever opened up fully to anyone but I can’t take it anymore and I’m a little drunk so that helps. I’m a 21 year old male I’ve been fucked over by people my whole life. I used to be pretty fat in middle and high school but recently lost a lot of weight I’ve never had a real relationship or in that fact real sex. The past few years have been shit. Freshman year of college I got in my first “relationship” and was cheated on and lied to before the relationship was a week old so it ended after like 6 days. Sophomore year I was raped by a girl. Junior year I fell in love and was ghosted after three months. The only time I’ve had sex was when I was raped. Trust me I’ve tried to have sex but I was either to fat in the past or most recently with the girl that ghosted me, I made a move while we were making out and she said no so I stopped. I don’t know what to do. I feel like most of my problems stem from girls and my confidence. I feel like I deserve better than a girl that just smokes weed all day and is kinda rude and gross (no offense). I feel like those are the main girls that talk to me on dating apps and nowadays that’s the only way I can meet people because of the quarantine. The girls I’ve been in “relationships” in the past have been really pretty but I’m so scared that I won’t meet someone like that who would last. What is wrong with me? I’m super nice but not the weird asshole kind of nice guy (fuck those guys). I’m pretty funny, at least funnier than my friends that hang out with girls all the time. I don’t know what to do I’m so lost. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I’m jealous of my friends (former popular kids in high school) they meet girls so easy because of their confidence and looks but they are such assholes. I just want to die, when the girl I was last talking to ghosted me I started cutting, I’ve never done that before but it really helped me find physical pain to match my emotional pain. I’ve held a knife up to my throat so many times before but I can never go through with it. I pray to god constantly throughout the day to give me the courage to kill myself but my prayers are never answered, just like the prayers for god to help me out in life.

SuicideWatch,"Hi there, whoever there might be reading this.

Below are my first and last post on Reddit, and last words towards this world which I lost all meaning to.

It’ll sound like some sort of “ stream of consciousness ”, and it’s really long, so I hope you all won’t mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 15, honestly 16 by the end of this year, so no biggie.

I’m sorry I’m making my age sound like my own identification; although, as if I have any right to an identification at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just here to tell my story, I’m not sure why, but maybe I just wanted some sort of forgiveness to my death; some sort of justification which I’ve been waiting for my entire life, yet never was approved neither given to this very day of my leaving this world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I might sound ironic because I am such a “ people’s person” in everyone’s eyes, or maybe just pure ridiculous. But really, after all this time from when I once had faith to this point which I’ve lost all and drifted off to this path of pure torture, I’ve again successfuly acheived what I had predicted from the start. I’ve managed to slowly make everyone disgusted of me, and I’ve managed to make all of them hate me and/or dislike me and resent me.

I have long thought I’d be lonely in the end, because I know very well that one day, all of this rotten pain and agony will leak out and scare all of those near me away.

But, well, it’s not like I need them anyway. They’ve proven their worthlessness the second they chose to be disgusted. And the second they became worthless: they became dead inside of me.

Dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I lost them one by one; I became more and more filled with self-denial, pain, unrecognizable sadness, and a new sort of sickness. 

( Yes, self-denial from the start of my life. I was really always trying to please people. But sadly, I’ve never been able to hate them at all, except my parents. Why? I’ve never been hurt by any other people in the wrong sorts of ways. )

And as this disease grew, in my state of hell, I began to see things clearer. I began to see how much I hate the two which I’ve placed so much faith upon. My mind became fallen apart by days in a more and more joyfully masked stupid grin, and nights in restless sleep continuously disturbed by short panic attacks whenever I close my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

There were images of odd things whenever I tried to rest. It’s kind of hilarious: chair legs with ends in thin and translucent spider-legs; spinning sea shells that become an never ending spiral stair-way the closer you look; people, children, widening their mouths as they cried in a twisted moan.

I suppose I watch too many horror movies, haha.

And then I’d wake up, unable to move or open my eyelids for a short half minute, only but my legs twitching uncontrollably as if I was trying to run.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my oh-so-friendly smiles? I was surprised myself. I never knew I could be so good at making myself look terribly happy, and even more and more happier as I actually became more and more lost.

Maybe it was the part of me that was slightly psychological that helped me in maintaining a cold heart ( yet annoyingly helpless, brittle, and ruined ), and an adjustable face; hiding my unwanted facet away from any searching eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

How did it all happen? 

Really, I thought of that question so many times; read and reread all of my memories over and over. I even did some research on my situation too. ( This is like some sociology project! ) 

( So, wow, I still have some sense of humor? I suppose it’s just how I am trained to be like over all these years. People don’t want sad-sad-sadness, or peaceful silence. They want to be pleased by. )

I came up with the conclusion that I had toxic parents. 

The description fits perfectly. 

Sure, some of you might start telling me I’m blaming it all on my parents. Oh in the name of God and all his love, shall I be grateful for all they did to me. I shall be grateful they gave me birth! Also I shall be grateful they gave me food!

Yes, sure, the list goes on, and I won’t mind naming it.

They gave me shelter, education… 

Wow, especially my mother! Yes, her.

She gave me most of all those things said above!

She even gave me a chance to drink my own vomit down from a plate because I cannot eat cheese when I was young!

Why? I shall be so grateful she bought me McDonald's when I pleaded with her to!

No, we weren’t broke. We were middle-class. And yes, I really was grateful, even when she made me drink my own vomit.

It’s all my fault isn’t it? Even now when I’ve committed to the fact that I hate them, I cannot put away my sorrow no matter what! I just knew, and I just can’t let go of the thought that all is my fault. Everything is my fault. It’s become my subconscious.

You want to hear more? 

I’ll just tell you then that my mother hurt me, both physically and verbally ( all the way to mentally ), because she feels lowly of herself, and is afraid of putting that rage of her’s anywhere else because other people will f\*\*\* her up. She’s afraid of her husband even though she hates him because he can’t do anything, is lazy, and is crazy. 

So who’s the easy target? Well, the person who believes her so much and is weaker than her, is me.

She’d just find any reason, like a single strand of hair ( literally, a single strand of hair ) on the bathroom floor, and smash and spit on me until she is pleased with herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Funnily, I was born in 2004, and my father became mentally ill in 2004 too.

He couldn’t stand to support a family without an OFFICE job. He doesn’t want to do anything else other than sit in a room and code computers, even though he can’t even be able to do a job properly without messing the program up.

So lucky me, my mother told me I was the root of all bad luck in this family, everything was because of me, my birth was a mistake that should’ve never happened. My aunt, which was once the only person I thought did love me, agreed to my mom that I was wrong and should never have been born too. 

And back then, I actually really agreed. And ridiculously, I believe that I was a mistake even now.

&amp;#x200B;

And my father? I don’t feel like talking much now. He just tried to molest me, three times.

My grandparents and my mom agree that I seduced him into f\*\*\*ing me. I guess I am a whore asking to let men f\*\*\* me for fun, even though I’m actually lesbian from the start and I have a girl I love.

( She isn’t my girlfriend though, so please don’t get it wrong. It’s all single-sided. But we are very close and she knows I like her anyway. She’s straight, and insists I’m straight when I really tried to tell her I’m not. I can rant about how amazing she is all day long, but that’s best not said now. I can’t live for her, she thinks I am just a tool to please her too. Even though I love her, I can’t, I’m just really tired. )

My mom told me I am a whore, and I am disgusting. 

Haha, funny things these days.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s… Just about it.

Other things? Like how did I hurt myself? I’m tired, I don’t want to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Come to think of it, I wasn’t asking for any justification. I just really wanted someone to love me.

Someone to shut my subconscious thoughts up, and tell me it is ok to not be okay.

I really did once want someone to sit with me in this hell, someone to be with me forever, and forgive me for everything ( ugh, my fault… Hahaha ) in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this world, how disgusting it is.

I love you all, even though you are all so meaningless and selfish.

I hope my soul perishes in hell, so I won’t have to ever wake up in any life anymore, even if I’d be happy.

This pain isn’t worth that little joy, because what I want won’t ever exist.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll go out tonight, dressed nicely, carrying a diary I thought I’d finish; 

and in the loneliness I’ve always had, I will have my salvation.

Reposted from r/Advice

This past year has been my senior year of high school, in the past 10 months I have been hit by a car, kicked out of my house by my alcoholic father and forced to live in the streets. During this time I was having a hard time coping with my emotions so I constantly felt depressed, I'm still struggling with that. My girlfriend was there for me through it all, even though I didn't expect her to. I'm currently living in a transitional living facility so she can't come and see me as often, and when she broke up with me suddenly I felt all the emotions come out at the same time.

I feel so cursed. I didn't do anything for my life to be like this. I feel as though I am just not loveable, it isn't something I deserve. I went out to the store and I bought a pack of razor blades but I'm too much of a coward to do anything to myself. People always say things pass but they certainly haven't for me. I'm seriously considering turning myself into a psych ward once again on the basis of suicidal ideation because it's all I ever think about, but I don't think my insurance could cover it.

I've been alone here most of the week for the past.. two years or so. My siblings have moved out. Of course they would, there's no future in a place like here.

Trying to live here is depressing. I have nobody to live these memories with even if I wanted to. I hated my environment, so I tried to change it. For the past year.

A deep cleaning of the house.

It was a year of pure struggle. My parents still wanted their junk, because why else would it be here for a decade. I threw out 40% of the trash. I cleared out several corners and cabinets. I encountered enough pests to put in thousands of tons of ground coffee. I hate these pests. They scare me.

My parents come back on the weekends. My dad is thankful that I'm helping them with their baggage. Of course. You couldn't care less. My mom is reluctant about throwing everything out. She searches through the bags of rubbish I have purposely stuffed for my own sanity, and keeps some of the stuff. God knows how many times I've attempted to throw one item out.

I ask them to help with cleaning. You know, it's similar to maintaining mental health. They are slow with progress, because they have different priorities in their lives. At some point my own mental health stopped being one of theirs, or maybe it never was.

I ask my dad to help out with removing the dead pests. He loves to make fun of me for being scared of the pests. They're just roaches, what's the big deal.

I've been going at it for the past year. The pests just keep coming. I don't know why. As much as they terrify me, they bring me comfort for the fact that they're almost a metaphor for my own situation.

I am terrified of being me. Everyone in my household makes fun of me for being me. I cry a lot and have intense emotions. That's a problem for my brother. I'm ""an accident"". That's a problem for my sister. ""You only have anxiety attacks because you're always on your phone and you don't sleep enough."" That's a problem for my dad.

SuicideWatch,"Hi baby, 

I don't know what'll happen tonight. I've already packed everything. I have a blanket to roll myself in tightly, all the pills I think I'll need. I need to prepare razor blades too. I'll sneak out into the forest tonight. I don't know how it'll go. Maybe if I cut myself up a bit, it'll help and ill choose to take only a bit of pills to knock myself out. I don't yet, baby. But know that you've given me more than I could've ever asked for. There's nothing you could've done, please don't blame yourself if I die. It was all me, baby. The only person who can save me is me, and I don't want to save myself. I'm sorry. I know that won't fix anything for you. I'm so sorry. I hope that you find this and recognise that it's me if I do die. Hahah, I always said that if I write a suicide letter that means it's all over for me and I've lost. It's okay, baby, you've made me the happiest person in the world. 

You're the love of my life. You're my world. You're my everything. I love you. I love you with my entire heart. Kocham cię, misiu. I hope you can tell it's me now hahaha. If not, let me write the most important word you've ever taught me: 우유. I wish I just got to hold you at least once. Feel your arms cover me and make everything disappear. Make it all okay for a night. I wish I could've kissed you, admired how beautiful you are in person. Feel your skin under my fingertips. Look into your eyes and tell you how much you mean to me. It'll be okay, baby. I know you know how much I love you. Thank you for giving me everything, for getting me through my panic attacks and comforting me when I cried and talking me through what I feel and helping me understand myself and the village inside my head. Right now it's only the homeless man and train conductor hahahah. Probably better that I 'm not letting it's population grow or discover who else is hiding in it. You make me so happy, no one but you can make my face hurt so much from smiling. If I survive tonight, I know I'll be going straight to the mental hospital. I don't think it'll be any help. 

If I don't survive, I hope this doesn't break you. I don't want to hurt you, baby. That's the absolute last thing I want to do to you. I can't live like this though, it's agony. You made my life worth it though. I got to experience your love. It was the purest, most magical thing I've ever felt. You make me feel so calm, babe. I want to fall asleep in your arms, and hear you breathing softly as you fall asleep too. I love you. I can't say that enough. 

I love you so so so sosososo much, baby. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being you. Thank you for sharing yourself with me. Thank you for getting me through each day. Tonight I have to fight it alone, I hope you understand, baby. 

Thank you for treating my heart so well. I love you forever.

Yours always,

SuicideWatch,"i was going to use a throwaway because people i know irl follow this account, but to be honest i don't really care if they see this. i just need to let this out.

so, i have several chronic illnesses/diseases, as well as severe mental health problems. i am in constant pain every day, both mentally and physically, and many people just assume i'm lying. although my conditions may be rare, they are all diagnosed and recognised by doctors, and they are very real.

i have no way of communicating how much i am suffering. and even when i do, all of the doctors and therapists just say there's nothing they can do.  apparently my constant aching and fatigue is 'incurable', and i'm 'mentally-resistant' to all medications and therapies for my mind, whatever the fuck that means.

if there's nothing nobody can do, what is meant to bhappen? am i just going to have to sit here and wait until this thing kills me? because i'd rather die in peace and when i want, then let some agonising disease do it for me.

my life is awful outside of my mental and physical health too. i am surrpunded by mentally and emotionally abuse people. i am constantly manipulated, degraded and ignored because they know my brain can't stop them. i've tried to reach out for help - i've called crisis lines, even the police. do you know what they did? said i was fucking lying. 

i self harm. i cut, i burn, i drink substances that really shouldn't be drunk.

i have seen shit that nobody should ever see, let alone a fucking child. i am 15.

if i were to 'save' myself, i don't know how i'd do it. a lot of people say that overdoses are a shitty way to go, but that's because they don't know how to do it properly. i do, which is why i'm just waiting for the drugs to come my way. hanging seems unreliable, i've tried slitting my wrists before, and i don't think i have the chemicals handy to kill myself that way either.

when pets are gravely sick, what do you do? do you let them suffer, watch them live their lives in pain because of your own selfishness? no, of course you wouldn't do that. you may love them, but you don't want them to suffer. **why is my situation any different? nobody wants to hear it, but it's true: it isn't.**

god, i wish euthanasia was legal in the UK. every night as i fall asleep, i visualise myself dying, all of the pain fading away, just slowly going into a state of peace. someday, that will become a reality. that reality is coming closer and closer to now.

i can't continue like this. stop telling me i'll get out of this situation, because i fucking wont. **i can't.** you need to understand that.

i will always be in pain.

I mentioned my suicidal thoughts to my psychiatrist multiple times and he just brushed it off every single time. Recently when I told him, he told me that ""I understand. It's a tough time, it will pass, just don't give up"", that just sounds like a ""deal with it and shut the fuck up"" to me

When I told my family....the only time I've opened up to them in years, they told me ""Don't think like that""

All my friends left because of who I am. They just wanted someone who can make them happy and my best friend....my last friend in college who stayed, told me that I have nothing to be sad about, that I'm like this again and then she moved on and on Instagram I just see how she's been hanging out with a lot of her friends and she's just better off without me

SuicideWatch,"Sometimes I'll watch movies as if some characters are surrogates for different parts of myself. Like one character represents me, another represents my suicidal ideation, yet another is the part of me that wants to live. I think it's because the concept of 'conflict' can be generalized to fit most situations, but it can help being able to relate to a movie character. For some examples:

In Little Shop of Horrors, Seymour (me) kills off more and more people (aspects of me) to appease a carnivorous plant (my suicidal ideation) until it kills him, too.

In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean (me) is constantly stalked by Javert (suicidal ideation) as he just tries to live his life to the best that he can.

In Phantom of the Opera, Christine (me) is tormented by the Phantom (suicidal ideation) as she is torn between him and her lover, Raoul (the part that wants to live).

In Portal 2 (not a movie, I know), Chell (Me) initially trusts Wheatley (suicidal ideation) until he takes over the entire facility and has to learn to trust GLaDOS (the part that wants to live).

SuicideWatch,"I am riddled with guilt. Currently in a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. As soon as I get out I am going to commit suicide, and I won’t fail this time. I guess this is my last attempt at seeking help/reassurance.
Background: I am 23F, suffer with Anorexia, OCD(Pure O), depression and BPD. 
Last year I was in a relationship with my then ex, for about 2 years. It was a pretty toxic/codependent relationship, mostly on my part due to my BPD abandonment issues, insecurity and paranoia.

I have always been very impulsive and reckless in the area of sex(as well as many other areas) never cared about using protection, always let men cum inside me etc without any form of contraception or without knowing their or my STI status. I guess I used(and still do) it as a coping mechanism or form of self harm in a way. 

My ex was always very responsible in this area and preferred to use condoms. However we did end up having a lot of unprotected sex throughout the relationship as I had told them that I wasn’t worried about contraception etc as I’d only ever had unprotected sex in the past and nothing bad had happened. I had convinced myself that I couldn’t get pregnant because of my long history with anorexia and had either no period or very irregular periods for many years. I had also never had an STI but hadn’t been checked in a while. I know this was very irresponsible of me and I feel extremely guilty over it as I could have put my ex’s health at risk. My ex persuaded me to get tested a few months into the relationship and thankfully I was all clear.

However, nearly a year into the relationship I fell pregnant. Again, I feel so terrible because I feel it was my fault that we had unprotected sex, as I was the reckless one and my ex was always very cautious about using protection. I feel like I (unintentionally) misled them that everything would be ok, because I was/am stupid and impulsive and reckless.

Anyway after about a month since finding out I was pregnant I decided to have an abortion. I was having a lot of mixed feelings at the time and went through a period of regret but I put this down to the hormones, because I knew deep down I didn’t want a kid(I have never wanted kids) and realized it was the right decision. 

I was prescribed birth control, which I had always been fearful to take because of my intense fear of weight gain due to my anorexia(I had read that can cause weight gain) and also because I have health OCD and was terrified it would cause me to get a blood clot and have a stroke(I read that BC can increase this risk). However I did start taking it. 

Our relationship kind of started going down hill around this time, I had started a new job as an exotic dancer, which I loved and was beginning to lose interest in the relationship, but I was very much in denial about it at the time. 
I hardly ever wanted to have sex anymore with my then partner which was obvs very upsetting and hurtful to them. And I feel  kind of bad and anxious to say this but I feel like every time we had sex wasn’t entirely consensual, as I was very disinterested but I feel like my partner kept pestering me for it even though I obviously didn’t want to. 

But this is one of the things that has me riddled with guilt and suicidal, after a while I was only sporadically taking my birth control, as well as the fears I described previously, I guess I just didn’t really care about taking it? I didn’t even want to be having sex with my partner, but I didn’t tell them I wasn’t taking it properly. And I guess I was still being my reckless impulsive self, not caring what happened to me etc. My memory is very hazey from around this time, I was going through a lot, had had another suicide attempt around this time and had spent some time in the psych ward. I am now wracking my brain trying to remember exactly what happened and it’s driving me crazy. I can’t remember exactly how often I wasn’t taking the pill. but there was a couple of times that I just went out and bought the morning after pill when I thought there was an increased risk of getting pregnant. For example one night my partner came inside me, I didn’t take my prescribed pill in the morning(just told my partner I forgot) but did go out and buy the morning after pill. I don’t know why I have less anxiety about taking that than the regular pill but anyway. 

So here I am a year later in the psych ward again and here’s why: A few days ago I came across a post on Instagram about “Rape by deceit” which said sex cannot be consensual if you do something such as lying about your STI status or lying that you’re on birth control when you’re not. Well, my world came crashing down around me. I am now convinced that this is what I have done and I cannot live with myself because of it.

I guess I’m scared, and overcoming survival instinct seems really hard. But I feel like I should be able to do it and don’t understand why I can’t.

SuicideWatch,"(I'm sorry if I make some mistakes, I'm still learning english) my mother told me when my brother was a baby he was very loud and I was the opposite. when I  cried she didn't pick me up till I fall asleep because I wasn't crying loud enough. 
20 years later she didn't change. she took care of my brother, loving him and supporting him all the time and I am very grateful for that since he is my brother and I only wish him the best but she left me alone, she judge me, insult me all the time , wishing me to die every day, given punches on my back while I was sleeping and after I couldn't breathe. telling my brother while he is beating me to do it harder, humiliating me in public, with my friends, teachers, making fun of me, having no social life because I was beaten if I was late and then I just didn't want to go anywhere because I wanted to avoid all of screams and slaps from my dad and I got used to it and now I can't have a normal relationships with anyone and that includes school or job. 
I lived for years knowing that I should repress anything and not feel weak. I shouldn't feel like I have to be loved because it's lame.
every person of my age never said something positive about me because I was cold and I acted like I didn't need it so they slowly were gone from my life. I looked so not interested all the time and I never reached them. 
I was very apathetic and distant and I barely talked. 
I never felt being alone since I was always by myself, I don't know the difference. 
I never did the things that teenagers do, having a boyfriend or girlfriend, going out for parties, having groups, smoking, going out in the night, drinking, having the first kiss ecc. 
I was convinced in my head that I don't deserve those things, I'm not the kind of person that should have those things or having fun, those are not the things that I deserve. 
and of course my mom told me that no one is gonna love me or be with me because I'm just don't have anything to love for. 
the only thing that my mom tells me to do it's house work, it's the only thing that comes out of her mouth when she calls me. when I'm in the state that I can't get out of my bed she just doesn't care and punches me or yell at me, insult me, wish me to die just because I'm not doing what she wants. 
she talks to me just when she needs me and I just don't want to do it if that's the only reason. 
when I was at the psychiatrist my parents were talking and insulting me all the time in front of her and the worst part is that she agreed and gave me a medicine for kids ( I was 17 years old) and told me it's my fault that it's not working and my parents till this day say to me that it's my fault that I am the way that I am (depressed) because I decide to be like this. 
I can't go to school or having a job because I don't have the mental and physical strength. 
it's been more than 4 years that I don't have friends, I only talk to people online witch I'm not friends with them anymore because the only thing that they did to me is hurting me repeatedly and using me for attention for years. 
I'm all alone in a country that I don't know the language, I don't know no one and I don't have anything.
I'm currently in the situation where I am continuously repeated in my face that I should get out of the house because no one cares about me.
I want to get out but I don't have any money and I can't have a job in this state. 
my mental state it's getting at the point that I don't have any strength to kill myself since I am so weak.
I really don't have anything to live for, I just don't feel life in me.
and if I hear someone say it will get better I can't comprehend how is it possible for someone to be so selfish and not understand that there is nothing to be better for people like me.
there is nothing to adjust, there is just nothing. 
so please don't console me, don't help me to live when I don't want to and help me to get out of this situation.",why I want to kill myself,t3_gs97l7,1

SuicideWatch,"Hi im 21 years old and I rarely do this so im sorry if it comes off as mindless rambling

Lately ive been feeling just a immense feeling of failure and lonesomeness and its started to entertain suicidal thoughts which isnt like me and its terrifying and upsetting 

For context my girlfriend of 3 years (LDR) and I have become progressively distant, some of it due to her and school but i also just get this feeling she doesnt feel the same towards me anymore and it kind of just hurts
i try to be proactive and talk to her and be affectionate but also give her space cause i dont wanna smother, so it just feels like a balancing act that im doing by myself but also like im slowly failing, so i cant help but feel a tad defeated i suppose

Another reason is the other day one of my close friends of about 3 years as well called me when i asleep so i missed it, when i woke up about an hour later i saw it but there was no follow up text so i thought i was too late and moved on with my day, later in the day i got a text from their gf saying they were mad and upset with me
I immediately felt bad so i dm’d them saying “sorry anon” but hadnt got a response for about 20 minutes, after that i tried to call them (idk it sounded like a good idea at the time) after about 5 minutes of ringing they answered but didnt say anything, i didnt say anything initially either cause i wasnt sure what to say to be honest, after about an awkward half minute of silence saying “hello?” 
he didnt respond but his gf did and was laughing while saying how mad he was
i tried to tell him “im sorry anon, i didnt mean to upset you” but still no response
so i sat there in silence confused and not sure what to do, i wasnt sure if it was a joke so i fooled around for about a minute but still silence, and i know he was there cause he would talk to his gf, eventually he hung up and i dont know what to think
i feel bad and i guess i was in the wrong but i didnt know it would be that much of a problem and now they havent sent a message in awhile and its just upsetting man

my parents have been fighting alot lately as well and ive had to break it up before it got physical and its an awful feeling, and my grandpa (my moms dad) died about two months ago in a freak accident at his job, and its just been so surreal to deal with

i dont know how to describe it but i feel like theres butterflies in my stomach but not the good kind, the kind where im scared for whats to come, i feel like all my friends are leaving cause im not consistent enough, i try to talk to my girlfriend to respark the conversation but it feels like it falls on deaf ears, and i feel like my home is falling apart and my family is at each others throats 

im a very lucky person to even have some of these things, but with how things are turning i dont know if i can handle it, it sounds really dumb but i just cant handle the stress anymore, i feel physically tired from the constant mindgames with myself and i shake when i think about getting that message that she wants to move on, or the silence from people who i thought were close to me, or the chaos in my own home

For some backround information about me, I am a fourteen year old british kid, who identifies as male despite being AFAB, and i also have autism. I am unsure if my identity will change in the future, but as of right now being referred to as a girl or a she makes me want to cry.

Im not sure if what im feeling is a product of puberty, as ive been feeling like i want to die since i was around eight, a year before i hit puberty, but its definitely made it worse. I also believe i MAY have depression and possibly anxiety, however that could just be hormones talking. Ive had symptoms of both illnesses since i was five. It sounds weird i know, but I definitely remember showing symptoms. Maybe my head made it up. 

Any way, Ive been seriously considering suicide for a while now. For the past five or so years its been passive, despite a brief period when i was ten when i almost went through with it, but as of now its gotten BAD. It all started about a month ago, when The Man Behind The Slaughter had just became a meme. I saw a post about breaking your thumb ligament and my brain instantly noted it as a way to self harm, which sent me down a rabbit hole and made me cry for the first time since i was around twelve. I didnt even cry when two of my dogs were put down and they meant the world to me. Anyway, not a day later, someone told my friend to go 'down the river next time retard' and i defended them. that someone proceeded to call me a retard multiple times, as well as calling me a failed abortion and told me to jump of a building, which was enough to drive me to self harm via cutting. I have been doing it occasionally since, as well as biting myself. 

the quarantine has been tough on me too, and ive been so bored recently that killing myself feels like the only good option besides sitting down doing nothing but mindlessly play ACNH or watch youtube. ive also not been able to sleep at normal times for longer than i can remember. this is bad because my Bad Thoughts get worse at night and im scared of the dark despite being a nightowl. 

anyway i just feel really helpless, useless, and that suicide is the only way to fix it. i dont even want to get help because im not a person beyond my sadness and i dont want to find out who i am without it in case im an even worse person. one of the only reasons i havent given up on my fear of death already is that i really want to catch up on One Piece before i die. i know its pathetic to hinge your life off of an anime that hasnt even ended, but its really the one thing i look forward to doing and even THEN i procrastinate it.

I can’t tell me friends or anybody. You might say that I have moments where I’m genuinely happy. But I’m not. Ever happy. Ever. Even when I’m with my horse. She makes me happier than anybody.

SuicideWatch,"My sister constantly harrasses and bullies me day after day and I've felt so worthless recently to the point where I don't even feel like I deserve to live anymore because I view myself as such a terrible person. She spreads lies about me all the time, threatens to take away my only friends by 'exposing' me being a terrible person. She does this probably every week and they're my only friends that I have. I cry myself to sleep almost every night in fear that I lose everything I've ever had. She fat shames me, tells me (very specifically) to 'slit my wrists in the bathtub', and she says it's fine because she said it like a month ago, but she doesn't understand it doesn't matter if it was a long time ago. A few days ago I even considered cutting myself because I wanted to feel something other than sadness for once. She told me to kill myself countless times last year, and although she doesn't anymore the pain still doesn't go away. I've been losing motivation to even get out of bed in the morning or even be hygenic and she always mocks me for it, calling me ugly and saying I 'eat too much and I should go on a diet'. She purpously brings up controversial topics so that I can say something I don't mean and then use it against me. Then it makes me feel like I'm a horrible person and I don't deserve anything and ends up with me breaking down crying. We fight almost everyday and I feel like there's no escape. I have considered suicide a couple times this year because I just felt to trapped. This probably doesn't matter, but she's self-diagnosed with ADHD and OCD too. Whenever she tells her story everyone believes her and views me as a bad person. I feel like this will never change because whenever I try to reason with her she doesn't listen. All of her friends don't know what she actually acts like. Also, she is going to therapy soon but that's on hold because of coronavirus, so there's no hope for that anytime soon.

SuicideWatch,"I really do wish I could kill myself. Not because I’m depressed. I may not have many friends but I’m hardly lonely. I have a caring and loving family whom would give their lives for me. Though we don’t have much money they’d buy me anything if I’d ask. I’ve never been a victim to bullying. Never been raped or sexually assaulted? Never experienced tragedy or anything of the sort.

Sometimes I wish my parents didn’t raise me right. Raised me to be someone who deserved to die. That way I could actually go through with it. But they ended up making a decent human being who cares for people. In the end that’s the only reason I don’t do it. Because I’m scared.

I’m not scared of dying. If I could die without any repercussions at all, I’d have done it a long long time ago. I’m scared of what my death will bring. The saying “death will only breed more death” would reign true if I end up taking my own life. 

My parents would feel like they failed in raising both their kids.

I feel my mother would go next given the fact she’s already depressed and blames herself a lot. Not to mention her, albeit rare, suicidal thoughts which I seem to have inherited from her. She still blames herself for my runaway sister. I blame myself for that too. And it would seem I’m making the same decisions that she did. Though she isn’t going to kill herself.

My father would presumably be next after my mother. My father, whom I’ve never known to cry in my 17 years on this god forsaken planet, still cry’s for my runaway sister and still prays at night for her safety. He would become a man who had lost his daughter, his son, and his wife. I fear he’d take his own life as well. Until only my sister remains. Perhaps he’d find comfort in drink again. As he did before he gave it up for my sister and I. But I feel that’d not be enough. It’d more likely just make it worse.

I’ve thought about my own death countless times for the past 5 or so years now. And it always comes to the thought of what will happen after. Because I’d then be responsible for my family’s eventual demise. 

Even so, can I still put up with this life I’ve mistakenly been given? Can I still live in wait for an approximate 30 or 40 years after my parents eventual deaths? I’m not sure I could.

I’m only a junior in high school and I can already see my education in the toilet. Even if I do get my education, I’d still have to get up for a job that I’ll hate and end up despise.

It is going to be my fault for everything though. I put myself in this position. And now I’m intentionally digging the hole deeper. I have only 4 hours left to potentially pass my junior year. Still with 8 weeks of school work to do. My procrastination problem has reached its peak. I’d like to think My laziness is inate but I also know that’s how I made myself. I’ll most likely end up failing this semester and make it up next year only to repeat the flawed process 

And what do I blame? This damned virus.

It doesn’t justify the decisions I’ve made. Or not made in this instance. But if I were still to physically go to school, I’d have passed without a doubt. It was only ever homework I refused to do. And since ALL my school work became homework, this damned pandemic inadvertently fucked me over. But I did it to myself as well.

Perhaps my parents would stay alive if the virus took me instead. That way they wouldn’t feel as though they failed. But even then I’d probably survive. And give my parents an unpayable medical bill considering we have no health care. They already have enough financial problems as it is. 

I suppose one can only hope. Right?

I am so tired of this. Tired, tired, tired, tired, tired, tired of waking up crying and going to bed sad knowing that the next day will be more miserable than the previous day. I am tired of writing depressing poems and feeling guilty about the fact that I’ve only writing about sad, dark sh*t. 
I am tired of feeling like I’m slowly drowning, knowing that I have no one to rely on. I don’t have a friend and my parents don’t want to associate with me, despite the fact that I’m home all the time and I don’t even have a social media presence. My brother threatened to beat me up yesterday in front of my parents and they didn’t react, even indirectly. They’re so hypocritical. The second I demand peace from my siblings, all hell breaks loose and me releasing my anger that has built up over a LONG period of time, without me hurting anyone, results in mom calling the police. They say that I am the problem, although I’ve worked on my toxic traits. How can it be me when I’ve done all I can to live peacefully? My mental health is so shitty I can’t even stand up without me breaking into tears and having this burden on my shoulders just makes me feel so worthless. If my parents don’t care, who will? My suicidal thoughts escalated gradually. It started with me making light jokes about death and shifting towards a nihilistic approach to life, although I’m religious. It definitely worsened yesterday when I talked to my teachers and I might fail two of my classes. With everything going on in my life, it’s been impossible to prioritise schoolwork. I’ve always imagined myself becoming a doctor, but that thought seems impossible now, when I might not graduate. (I’ve always been a very academic and ambitious person). My brain is going to explode I hate hate hate hate myself for thinking like this. Sometimes I think about how my situation is so little compared to people going through a lot worse. 

Yesterday I did what I would never imagine myself doing. I looked up ways to kill myself and felt oddly comfortable knowing that I could decide which day I would die. My mind is so foggy so i don’t know if I’m even expressing myself clearly enough. Another thing is that I’ve always seen myself dying young, I can remember me telling mom this as a child. Maybe this is destiny for me.

I miss having someone significant in my life that felt for me the same way I did for them, ever since I lost those feelings for Tishell, it's been impossible to remake that essence. Unfortunately, it's not something I can go back to any of my exes to remake, it just really doesn't work.

My mother is a difficult person to deal with, my father can be difficult to me but for different reasons. My mother means well in almost everything she does for me, I appreciate it deeply, but her execution just doesn't fit for some reason. I don't take much initiative for things I don't care about, chores is a part of the many things I don't care for. She expects me to want to do these things out of love for her and my family, but I won't do things I don't want to do unless I'm asked or if it's for a greater good. She doesn't like that and takes my lack of initiative as unappreciative and disrespectful behavior. Not only that, but it feels like she puts the position of a mother higher than it should be. Yeah, you gave birth to me but I didn't ask for that, so that kinda cushions a lot of your argument. Yeah, you raised me, thanks. However, not only was it partially out of obligation, and it's not as if anyone could take up the role of caretaker. That may seem like an insensitive opinion, but at the same time, if you give someone a baby and they choose not to abort it, in today's society I believe it's not only their responsibility but their job to take care of that child. At which point, it's immoral to hold it over the child's head that you raised them and birthed them. At that point, you asked for it, they still didn't. 

School has always been something I've detested growing up, as it always felt forced. That's because it was. I've now graduated from high school, class of 2020. No prom or graduation, I'm not exactly upset about either. I just want my money back for the portion of student dues that I paid for things I won't get to experience. Now, I look for higher education. I'm going to a local community college. My grades are barely acceptable, and I don't even know what I'm going for. I picked a community college since it'd be free and I don't want to financially commit. What I really want to do with my life is teach guitar, or do something in relation to sound or music. Only problem is that I'm still learning myself, I'm starting to realize YouTube videos aren't going to teach me very well anymore so I'm going to need real lessons if that's what I plan on. 

I work at chipotle, it sucks. Some of my coworkers suck, most are great to work with. There's not much to expand on there.

I think about death and suicide all the time. It happens in random bursts. Sometimes I'll begin to daydream about stealing a police officer's gun from their waste and shooting myself in the forehead, like something out of a movie. Or maybe since I'm black, I'll just do something provoking and get them to shoot me. Maybe I'll take a trip to the shooting range one day and make it happen then. Irregardless of how I die, I can say almost certainly that if I find myself in a situation that could cost me my life, I would hesitate to escape from it. 

Why do I want to die so much? I feel like my life is nothing. It means something to my friends and family, but it doesn't mean anything to me. I'm quite tired of living in a world that works the way this one does, and yeah, you can say ""the world has problems, deal with it"". That's a fair way to think, but at the same time, I'm free to think and feel whatever I want. I'm free to want to die, and I'm free to go out and die so long as I'm not bringing harm to anyone else in the process. I don't think I have what it takes to follow my dreams, my web of friends has fallen apart, my family isn't the right one for me, and I can't find the significant love that I lost. That's why I'd rather die than keep living, not to mention I'm really curious in general as to what it's like to be dead. 

Even though I feel all of these things, I'm not going to kill myself any time soon. Mostly because I don't want to fuck it up and end in a lot of pain, but also because I don't feel like going through all the trouble of killing myself.",I just stopped and noted how I feel and what I was thinking.

Everyday for the past decade has been the same, just spending in front of a computer screen, behind a locked door. When I went to school, I spent my time there isolated. I never learned how to socialize or make friends, so I just stared at my phone and waited until 3pm. Now I'm twenty and haven't made any process. I can't get a job because I'm too pathetic.

 I met Sarah about a month ago on Instagram, we bonded over art and webtoon, we were just talking about each other and she asked me for anything interesting about me, so I told her a bunch of random stuff, I then told her I was bisexual, and she was the first person I told, and I told her that. She then was all like ""wow, it's ok, I am a lesbian myself, but if my family found out I would be disowned, or  probably hit."" That surprised me and we somewhat talked about it. She then asked if I was going through anything, and I told her I was going through perfectionism, and we got to talking about how the pandemic was affecting us. She then asked me if she could tell me something and I said sure, she then told me that her dad sexually assaults her and has been doing it since she was 7. I then asked her some questions, telling her constantly that she doesn't have to answer any of them. I found out that he touches her about 2 times a week, she has tried to tell her mother but she doesn't believe Sarah, her dad doesn't do it to her sisters, that she doesn't ever fight back and is very skinny, short and vulnerable, and every time she sleeps she has a nightmare of her dad assaulting her. All I know about where she lives is in the united states and her time zone, so I can't help with any laws, but she doesn't want to get her family into any legal trouble, she still cares about her family and doesn't want to harm them. Due to all of this, she harms herself and has stopped eating. Her sister who is 13 hits her daily for no reason at all, or if she annoys her in any way, Sarah always apologizes and cries when it happens(crying is seen as weak in her family). 

We have been talking nonstop for the past month, and one time she was talking bad about herself and that she deserves to die, I didn't know what to say and how to get her to stop, so I said stop it or I will ignore you.(I know this was very wrong, and I shouldn't have said it) she then stops and starts apologizing, begging me not to leave her, and that she really doesn't want me too. This is where I realized how much I messed up, and I apologize, and I won't leave her. She seemed to calm down some but kept begging me not to leave her, and that she will change, she will do anything I want. A day passed and she hasn't told me anything that happens so I told her I was deeply sorry and I will try my best to prove to her she can trust me again, she told me none has done that for her before and that we can work on it. this was 2 weeks ago, and we are good now, but she is struggling and has no idea what to do about her family, and I have no idea how to help. I really need some advice on how to help Sarah, what she should do, and how to get her dad to stop sexually abusing her.

SuicideWatch,"So when I was around 8 something happened and my father left and it was just me and my mother. This means we lost the house. 


I can remember a ton of events from 5-8 and a ton of events from 10-now


But during that time when we lost the house we stayed with a woman from our church that reached out to my mother and offered to let us stay with her for about a year. 


I vividly remember walking into the woman’s house and being shown a room and told this is where you’ll sleep, here’s the tv blah blah


Now here’s the thing. After that day I can’t recall any memories in that house, even though my mother said we were there for around a year. I can’t remember the house, being driven there from school, where it was, or even a single meal I ate there, nothing but the memory of arriving and being shown my room. 


Is it possible I was abused or drugged or something while I was at that house?


Conveniently that’s also when I started going from the type of student where teachers said I was way above my reading level, etc to stuttering if I had to read a single sentence in class, and my grades dropping dramatically.  And that’s also conveniently when I discovered I enjoyed pain in the genital area which developed into a fetish that still haunts me.

Usually I just read or upvote on reddit and don’t write so much myself.

I’m writing this because I’ve been wondering about pain during self-harm or suicide.
I’ve been cutting my skin for a while now whenever I get one of these days and almost daily I imagine all the different ways how to end it.
I never could go too far though. 

While you barely feel light cuts whenever I tried to go really deep with the blade it hurt a lot which scared me again. It’s not making me want to life again or makes me afraid to die - I’m just afraid of the pain Inexperience shortly before death.
I feel numb all day long yet if I get too deep cuts I back off out of pain.
That’s why I mostly imagine about swallowing pills.

Because this is being posted at 3 am on a somewhat popular subreddit, I don’t think this will get any attention whatsoever, but I don’t know what to do so I’m just going to speak my mind. I hate my life so fucking much. I honest to god don’t know why. I live in a good house with a good family, and an active social life, and every day I come home and feel just as lonely as the last. 

I feel like no one in my life actually cares about me. They care about me for their own self benefit. My parents say they care about me but they just want to say they have a son that is successful.

My friends don’t care about me. They turn on me the moment I get real about anything. I’m always a background character in everybody’s life. Everyone just likes me because I’m fake about my personality to everyone I meet so I can appear cool.

The one person who got me, my first gf broke up with me a month ago and I haven’t talked to her since. She was perfect for me, and we both liked each other but she doesn’t think a relationship in high school can work.

I had a party today, where everyone around me felt like they were being fake. Everyone looked like they were having fun when I wasn’t there. I just want to be liked and respected by someone, anyone that i can likewise respect.

I’ve attempted suicide before, and it ended with me becoming isolated by my friends and treated differently. I just want to die. I see no future for myself. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t have friends. I just want to walk to downtown in the middle of the night and jump off the biggest thing I can see.

I have a diploma in IT that i obtained back in 2018. I wanted to take some time of because I felt really depressed at the end of the diploma also I wanted to find work. 

Honestly, I was not prepared for life. I don't know how to self-learn. I thought it would be easier than this when I was younger. My resume is shit, i have no discernable accomplishments despite working hard to get a good gpa for my diploma, even then its only 3.56. I felt little interest in programming because I was always had trouble trying to understand programming.  I got depressed, turned to the only thing i felt happy in, video games and porn.

I stopped porn but sexual thoughts still linger on and off. I told myself i'm gonna work harder now, try my best to get my degree even though I don't exactly like it.

SuicideWatch,"Today I’m 16 and still living with my parents. I got C’s and B’s in middle school because I didn’t care to study, and I’m getting B’s, C’s, and some A’s in sophomore year. My dad always tells me that I need to do my best in everything I try, but my nature is to half-ass or not even attempt schoolwork. 

I don’t know if I’m allowed to think that I’m not fit for living in this world. On one hand, it’s wasting all the money and years of time that my parents took to raise me. I got in an argument with them earlier today and my mom said I should just get emancipated because it would finally make for a calm household. I also believe that my behavior contributes to my mom’s depression, and on multiple occasions she said that she should just kill herself, or that no one would care if she died, likely because of my arguments with my parents. I would still be a burden and likely not be able to find independence as a college student or as an adult. I don’t know how I’m supposed to discipline myself to start studying hard and do well in school, and find a field that I would enjoy working in. On the other hand, there’s millions of people that do what they hate every day just to survive. I would be wasting the opportunity that is living in a privileged neighborhood with well-off parents, and for what? Because I can’t be bothered to put in hard work like everyone else on this planet?

SuicideWatch,"All of the courses I would like to take, all of the careers I would like to have, everything I want out of life — all these things involve putting ideas out into the world. I want to write, or complete academic research, or edit, or translate, but all of that seems so inherently narcissistic. Why would I assume that anyone would care to hear what *I* have to say? I was completing some research this morning and came across so many beautifully written, cogent peer-reviewed articles. Pathetically, reading them made me want to cry. I realised that I will never be able to produce something so lovely. I will never get to that point. I have absolutely no semblance of a promising future. Unintelligent, uninteresting, talentless, worthless — how could I be so conceited to think that I would ever deserve to have my writings published, let alone even study the arts?

I hate myself so deeply for all of this, and that, too, is egotistical. I must be so disgustingly self-involved to be constantly analysing myself, constantly psychologising my wishes.

I wish I were someone, anyone else. There are so many wonderfully bright and optimistic people around me. They are brimming with self-confidence, and they should be, because they possess skills and intellect that are leagues away from my own.

I don't believe I can contribute anything of worth to the world.

SuicideWatch,"I feel like I'm… not really anything.

I lost out on experiencing my younger years - first out of introversion, then out of depression, self-hatred, and fear of rejection. I've only ever wanted to have a teeming, rich life with close friends, to feel the blind, unbound passion of young love, to know the joy of being valued and desired by someone else and to share in the world's wonder and mystery together… 

But it never came to pass. I never did any of those things, and to this day I have never smoked weed or dropped acid, I've never gone to a party or a concert with friends, never went on joy-rides, road-trips, or go to museums… Never been asked out, never been kissed, never so much as held hands or stared longingly into the eyes of an interested other… never had awkward first-time sex, better second-time sex, never got the chance to eat a girl out, any of that. That part of my life, with all of its promise and romance, is hopelessly gone, perished into the ever-waxing past.

Graduation was five years ago. All those people I used to know, friends and peers alike, have moved on in their lives, grown and experienced the world for good and ill. They've performed in plays, wrote music, studied philosophy and ecology. They've attended dour-but-hip goth raves and tripped miles in the desert sun. They've struggled, questioned and second-guessed, switched majors three or four times… but lived and lived as well as they could, and their kaleidoscopic brilliance and talent will outshine them all.

As for me? Nothing. If I missed out on life during high school, it would only make sense that I'd miss out on life in college, too. Where everyone else was building themselves and their careers, I have merely worked, on and off for five years. Saving money I suppose, but hardly living - and all the while, whiling away my spare time on trivialities, minutiae and useless hobbies. The feeling of always being behind has followed me through the years, but not so much as today. I could've been so much more at the age I am now, 23. I could've been a young up-and-coming artist, a guitarist in a band, could've been part of a greater collective spirit. But in my maladaptive reticence, I've stayed inside, retreated into my own little world, one without texture or rhythm, and I've suffered for it. Forever the late-bloomer, even in the passing of youth.

""If only I had applied myself."" So goes the saying when it's assumed that you can muster the will to find motive and reason, and force yourself into action, when you know what you want and have a clear sense of direction. I can't and don't, for whatever reason, and no one seems to understand that, hardly myself even.

These last few years, with all of their discouraging subtleties, have worn me thin. I had contended with Pure-O and depression for the first two years out of school, something which plunged my sense of self far into the churning mantle of the earth. I became more neurotic, more skittish, more anxious and inconsiderate. I've alienated people with whom I was once close, and marred relations with family and friends… yeah.

And in drifting through these tidal cycles of avoidance and habit, I developed a paralysing social anxiety and an addiction to pornography… And I hate porn. It's crude, insensitive, misogynistic, and intended to appeal solely to the male gaze. But it kept the loneliness at bay, for a time. It distracted me from myself - how much I despise my body, how I abhor even brief glances at myself in the mirror, how less-than-endowed I am, how chubby, short… I could go on forever. Self-love is not within my capability. Suffice it to say I am forever lorn of it even in that most personal of regards.

…I've tried to improve myself. I tried to get my driver's license, tried to lose weight and take better care of myself, tried to keep in touch with family and friends despite my social ineptitude, tried for school and moving out of my parents' house, even scheduled a therapy appointment for ADD, though I'm on a long waiting list now. For a time I thought it was possible to get better, that is, until this latest catastrophe among many swept across the world. I've been unemployed for a few months now since the beginning of this pandemic, the same sob-story as untold others I'm sure. But all I've worked for in the past year or so is withering under the nothingness of everyday spent at home, stuck repeating the same ritual and never progressing… Everything has gotten worse.

Amid this pandemic and the generally shambled state of the world today, there are few bright spots to grasp for. The country that I was born and raised in, a country that I refuse to exalt but the only home I've ever known, is haplessly slipping further into the clinch of authoritarianism and corruption. Whatever paltry semblance of democracy we may have had is eroding and yielding to the tide of fascism, and I do not believe that is hyperbolic to say. Growing discord and civil-strife, geopolitical tension, and an increasingly bleak socio-economic outlook… the list goes on and on. But the one that towers above the rest, for me, is the fact that against the backdrop of this tumult, there looms the ultimate existential threat of ecological catastrophe - the one thing that if nothing else, will do us all in. Ever the peachy reminder. So much to look forward to!

…Am I being ungrateful? Am I being selfish? Is this soliloquy getting tiresome yet? I've lived life thus far with less than half of what other people have endured, dealing with things that stronger people would otherwise have the will to overcome, even at their lowest points. Yet, I cannot help but feel frustrated, helpless, and hopeless - like I'm half of a person with no motivation, no talent, no direction. I want to experience life to its fullest. I want to be someone that matters, to do something that has weight, a positive impact. I want freedom, I want depth. I want creativity and flourishing. I want human connection, deep lasting love, something other than my own habitual inhibitions… It just seems that I'm my biggest obstacle to any of that.

Is there any hope?

SuicideWatch,"This is probably pretty common. I was raised in a cult with very strict rules and expectations about gender roles. I was born female, I am non binary gender fluid. I am single, 25, I have no kids and I work. All things that according to how I was raised means I'm a failure.

By 19 I should have been married, by 25 i should have 3 kids at least. And i definitely should not be working, because i should have been a stay at home mom. And honestly that is what I want to do. I hate the religion I left, it fucking sucks, but the one thing that actually fit was being a stay at home mom I really do want that. But because I havent achieved that yet I'm a failure to most of my family, just one brother and his wife and kids and one uncle I never talk to have also left that religion.

I have no schooling, no savings, a low paying job, no marketable skills for remote jobs besides customer service and call centers are literal hell. I have no prospects for a good future and its killing me every day.

I barely lasted a year at most of the jobs I've had. I worked 5 years at a hardware store, but it just about drove me into the hospital.

But the thing is, I havent actually contemplated killing myself since I was 14. I wrote a note, put it in an envelope and addressed it to my mom. Then I hid it, forgot about it and found a way to work through my feelings by writing fiction with a friend. Cue a year later when I found the note again and re read it to see how far I had gotten. The envelope had been ripped open and it was obvious someone had read it. At the first read through i didnt notice it, but then i saw in the margins a correction to a term i used. Someone had read this suicide note that wasn't dated so to them could have been very recent. And instead of trying to get me help they fucking corrected my grammar and PUT IT BACK LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. And to top it all off like a nice fucking cherry I recognized the hand writing because no one else in my family wrote that way except my mom.

What kind of fucked up person reads a suicide note from their child, addressed to them as the reason they want to die, and doesn't do fucking anything except correct their grammar. Did she want me to die? Did she want me to kill myself so that she wouldnt have to deal with me anymore?

I've cut her out of my life, it fucking hurts, but I cant live in her shadow constantly with her manipulation and underhanded attempts to make me rely on her for everything. But I'm still in a dark place.

I actually got suicidal today. I called out of work, because I didnt have the energy to do anything except cry about how useless I am. And I feel fucking guilty as hell and like I cant fucking do anything right. And all day I could hear her voice ""you should have gone to school then you'd have a better job."" ""You should have gone to the singles thing at church because then you would be married."" ""You shouldn't have cut your hair like that because now no one wants to be seen with you, especially me."" ""You cant leech off of other people forever, someday you'll need to prove you are an adult."" ""You shouldn't need meds to control your ADHD but you left Jesus so now it's your fault you feel like this."" ""If you hadn't gotten that tattoo you would be way better off in life, sinners arent winners.""

And it just goes on and on and it never fucking stops and I'm so sick of it I just want it to stop, but i want to shove it in her face when i prove to myself that i can be happy and successful without that horrible cult. But it feels like that will never ever happen and it feels like shes right and then a sentence that everyone in that cult says about people who leave pops in my head. I even said this when I was a believer. ""You'll come back. You'll realise you made a mistake by leaving. You'll come back, they always do."" And I want to go back. It would mean facing all the smug faces of my family as I prove them right. It would be so simple to go back and find a man who will marry me and give me kids, but I'll have to play 1950s house wife and be perfect and prim and proper and indoctrinate my kids into a religion that hurts so many people and act like I'm happy all the time and I hate the idea of that, but then how is that different than every single fucking day in my life where I put on my customer service face just so I can smile at my friends and family and they'll believe me when i say I'm fine, how are you.

If you read this far, dont worry. I'm too fucking scared of the void waiting after death to actually end it all, at least for tonight. I just needed to get this out and actually feel like it's possible someone will listen, even if they dont really care.

I'm empty, I dont feel good or bad about it all, I feel empty and I'm so ready to not feel empty but I cant seem to figure out how to make myself work like a normal person.

I'm stuck, like a pebble that dreams of being a tree some day, static and unchanging other than being worn down by storms and temperature changes, when really i want to grow tall, feel the sun, grow leaves and have little seedlings pop up around me and I help them grow. Itll never happen. I know I'm young, but at this point I can tell. It wont happen and I'm not sure why I keep hoping for it. I dont even know what love feels like.

Thanks for reading. I'll be fine for tonight. I sincerely hope no one feels like I do, I wouldnt wish this on anyone ever, no one deserves this. I know that's a hopeless thing to hope for considering the sub I'm on, but I still do.

SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday was a low point for me mentally, and for the first time, I called a suicide hotline to help me. This time I knew that if I didn't do that, I would actually take action on my thoughts. For some background, I got myself out of a 3-year depression without telling anyone, until I was out of it. This year was a relatively smooth one, but isolation really drove me to a new territory. My anxiety made me have to take meds to calm me down and thoughts of death really being persistent. 

I don't know why I'm even doing a post but to those who need it, it really comforts you, knowing that there is someone that cares at that moment of time. The person who I spoke to was so kind and understanding. I encourage you to do the same and talk to someone, if it wasn't for her, I would've gone through with my plans.",So I called a hotline eventually.,t3_gs1wyg,1

SuicideWatch,"Hello

I (26F) have wanted to kill myself since I was a kid. I was first put in a 72hr hold psych hold when I was 12. I was physically abused by my parents as a kid to the point where my body is now in constant pain and I have issues with my spine and hips. My cousin sexually abused me when I was a kid. 

I have tried to work hard as an adult. I got a degree in Microbiology. After I couldn't find a job in that field , I taught myself coding and got a job as a software engineer only to lose my job because I had a drink at lunch (A coworker found out and told on me).  I currently work as a cam model but I fucking hate it. Right now its hard to exercise because of the pain so my body is a on the soft side (I have a belly) and I am self conscious about my spine. and I don't make as much money as girls with perfect bodies. I fucking hate doing it, I don't want to go online but I have to in order to pay my rent. I do not have anyone to help me monetarily. 

I suffer from severe PTSD  and Borderline Personality Disorder. I have severe dissociation to the point where I am not present enough to be able to drive, so I would have to find a work at home job but I can't seem to land one. I just pretty much give up at this point. I was in a relationship with a really great and supportive guy but then I fucked it up because of my Borderline Personality. I was a bitch. I hurt him a lot and I regret it. I hate my life. i have the worst luck and I do not want to be here. 

I can get percocet and xanax and alcohol and mix it all together. Does anyone know how much perc I would need?",I do not have anything,t3_gs1lbk,1

SuicideWatch,"I've dropped from (approximately) 220 pounds to 193 in the span of 8 months. I've recently decided to learn how to ride a bicycle. I have a few hobbies. I was promoted to a board member for my uni's writing club. I've gotten told that I'm sweet and even a bit attractive. 

And despite all that, I feel empty and I feel like there's something missing. I see all these people around me with their own lives, all these relationships while I barely have anyone. Nobody contacts me first and I have to reach out to people first and even when I try to talk, it's mostly one word responses. People talk over me, get angry when I try standing up for myself even a little. I think I'm bipolar; I check a lot of the boxes. I've had depression since I was 10; I didn't need a therapist to figure that one out. 

I'm still a virgin at 22, and could end up being one at 30 at the rate I'm going. I'm not kissless and I've had ONE relationship... but that ended after 3 days when I found out she was cheating. Absolutely EVERYONE around me talks about sex like it's nothing. So don't come in here and tell me that's what it is. It's easy for you to say when you've had it. I truly don't want to graduate college a lonely and single virgin when it seems the consensus is that it gets harder to find someone after uni. I'm already halfway through college. And nothing. 

I feel trapped, isolated, and I feel like no matter how much I try to work on myself, or fix my body or change my mindset, it will NEVER be enough. I'm relatively sheltered, I haven't achieved much like most of the people my age, I'm not living my best life, I've never had a job, I don't know how to drive, I've never been drunk... and people keep telling me confidence comes from experience... ***something I don't fucking have.*** 

The only comforts I have is my digital art and my storytelling. That's it. There's nothing else going for me and nobody gives a shit about me. So why should I give a shit about anyone else? Might as well find some rope and be done with it, because I don't think I can do this anymore.

I was happy growing up. I had friends and a family who loved me, and I was normal. Sure I had anxiety and depression, but I always thought things could and would get better. It makes me sad that the version of me at age 10, 15, 20 etc. never thought it would come to this. I always thought that there was some hope and help that I could cling onto.

But that’s not reality. Realistically most things don’t actually get better. Sure a few things may lighten up, but that feeling never lasts long. 

I guess in the end it’s up to the individual to decide if there’s enough good stuff in his/her life to balance out the bad stuff. I’m sure a better person would choose to focus on the good stuff and live his/her life optimistically. But that’s just not me.

SuicideWatch,"Yup it's me again, still thinking about dying. According to my parents, i was always a relatively happy child. But after the age of 11 or so, i started noticing something about my emotions. They are all just... off. And really hard to describe. Happiness is just... brief and almost unpleasant. Anger feels like an impulse to do something. Sadness is just like wanting to cry. But recently, i cannot seem to even get those reduced feelings. Everything that made me happy doesn't anymore. I've also tried new things, but those also dont make me feel any happiness. And i cannot reiterate how much i HATE. THIS. I just don't enjoy anything again. It's suffering. Just. Plain. Suffering. Torture even. The only thing i sort of enjoy is sleeping. And even that is getting old. I just don't want to do anything anymore. If anything, doing those old hobbies only serve as a distraction from the suffering. I just don't know what to do anymore. Also, sorry if this was hard to understand.

I've been to countless doctors and therapists etc at my family's request. My family keeps telling me they're worried about me, that I will do something really stupid. My cousin died some months ago to suicide, and seeing how it affected his family and even mine really ruined me. I don't think I'm directly suicidal anymore, but now I see no possible escape.

I'm tired of making my family worried. I'm tired of my sister, mom, and dad, asking me to please eat. My sister almost broke down crying the other day talking to me about how she was afraid I might attempt suicide. My mother has hinted at the same multiple times. 

I didn't use to have problems sleeping but now I spend 3 hours in bed slowly going mad until I can sleep. I have a ton of trouble eating too, which seems to be getting worse by the day, it's hard to explain but it just feels like my body doesn't want to eat, even if I'm starving. Feels as though I'm tired of food. I can't even bring myself to brush my teeth. I hate that my parents have to do so much for me because I can't bring myself to do it. Making toast is too much of a bother. I don't know what to do about it. I've been to so many different people for help, doctors and psychologists and people that think they can massage or hypnotize my mental health back because my mom keeps asking me to. 

Corona has pretty much saved me because anytime I'm at an exam I break down and puke, so luckily they have been cancelled this year. Still though, just presenting over teams or zoom to other students in my class brings me nausea for hours leading up to it, only getting worse and worse until it is finally done. Sometimes it feels like I get stressed and anxious over just going to the store to buy something if I haven't in a while. Started shaking and feeling nauseous the other day over going to a corona test. I'm not even scared of corona or the test itself in any way shape or form.

I am turning 27 in June, and I always believed that I would be a member of the 27 Club. I see no other alternatives, I can't imagine my life going anywhere else. If I look to the future all I see is the abrupt self-inflicted end to a timeline that only spans 27 years. 

I keep saying to myself that this is it. I know that this is how it's meant to be. I'm not a musician or an actor or an artist, I haven't made a name for myself. I have to kill myself at 27. There is nothing afterwards. It won't carry on, it only lasts 27 years. 

It's getting closer all the time and I can't imagine anyone will take me seriously, but I'm burning from the core and I'm going to go out. 27 is the end. I tattooed 27 tally marks on my wrist, right over the radial artery. It was decided for me, before I even existed.

SuicideWatch,"Please remember this is a dream. I’m going to tell it as well as I can remember it before it escapes my mind. The dream had a few “scenes” with no real transitions in between, just flashes. I remember quick images of other things happening from the dream, but I don’t know when they would have happened.

It starts in some old-feeling library. I can’t imagine where this place actually is bc I don’t recognize this at all. Well I was sitting in there, sobbing, begging my boyfriend to stay. He didn’t care. His mom ended up there too, and more in the “background” were his stepdad and two brothers. They just kinda showed up eventually because they weren’t there in the beginning, but they didn’t really care either. It felt like I was screaming and crying and begging to a wall. I ended up having a nervous tantrum and throwing a chair around, breaking it. They still hardly seemed to notice. I grabbed my boyfriend, hugged him, screaming/crying and ran off. He still barley seemed to notice. 

The next thing I know is I was in an overgrown playground with weeds almost as tall as me. My head was spinning. I was looking around, trying to find something to kill myself with. There was nothing I could really jump from, no rivers to drown myself in. Across a fence I noticed two people sneaking around and one of them had a gun. I climbed over the fence and started running at them, full force, yelling “shoot me.” The one who had the gun got spooked and shot me twice in the neck. The second that happened they disappeared, and I was looking up at the tall weeds as everything faded to black. For a moment, the world faded back in to show me some people I didn’t recognize, looking down at me, murmuring, and everything faded to black again. 

In between that last fade to black, and waking up, I felt at peace. When I woke up, I felt disoriented, and I felt something stuck in my throat. I thought it really happened for a second, and now I’m waking up in my bedroom. It took me a second to realize it was just a dream, and when I did, my heart sunk. I finally managed to get myself to wind up dead and it wasn’t even real. Im crying. It felt so real, and then it felt so peaceful.",I had a dream in which I killed myself.

SuicideWatch,"I fucking hate everything. And yes, I also fucking hate myself for that.

My life is bullshit just as I am.

19 y/o, born and raised in the shithole named ""Belarus"" (fucking gutter west of Russia and east of Poland. I don't know if this correct, but fuck if I care). I doubt any of you know about it, but who gives a shit.

I don't give a fuck about my family. My father &amp; mother were always bickering back and forth like lil bitches. In fact, I'm just a product of unintentional pregnancy or whatever the fuck y'all call it. My father is an alcoholic piece of shit, a cheater, a barbarian, who destroyed the meaniing of the family in this very cell of society. I was fucked in this life and he was drunk. I got pushed out of my mother's vagina into this life and guess what? This fucknut was high again!

Despite how much he fucked up or how much he cheated, my moms always forgave him. He punched her, he slurred at her, talked shit to her, threated her with moving her outta their place. I had to protect her several time, in one of our encounters I even almost fucking killed him (no bullshit here). Yet again, guess what? In the end they divorced, but now they reunited on good note and acting all happy-hippy-yay and all that shit. Fuck them both.

They used to beat me, slurr at me (which they still do), expecting to me act mature in my 11 years and shit. Yet, they didn't give about me fuck at all. No asking how my days go, what I like and what I don't, what I strive to be, etc, etc, etc. I was neglected, idk, maybe I just feel so. My mom had a burden to carry our family, but I still hate them both.

I also have a sister, but I'm not tight with her. There's like 10 years gap between us. I had many fallouts with her too. Anyways, point is - I'm not close with her nor I wish to be close with her anymore. I tried to close this gap, but it didn't work. Anyway, fuck her too.

I'm not sure if I sucked at school. I guess I had potential, but I just didn't gave a shit just as my family. I just kept flowing with stream. My grades was good, but not great or best. Had potential with math, physics, chemistry, yet I blew it. Graduated a year ago, failed at entering all public universities with scholarship, so I went to a private one. Busted some balls with it, spent a fine sum of money on it, and now I dropping out. It's just ain't no me.

I betrayed my first true best friend, when I became a bully. Was picking with others on weak, and my friend happened to be 'weak'. I broke his finger at the end of 5th grade and he has left the school. I tried to reconnect with him, but he rightfully rejected me and told me to fuck off. I've deserved it all the way.

From 2014 shit started to took off. Depression, nihilism, loneliness and all that shit. Ended up spending most of my teen years playing v-games and shit.

I wanted to go to US since I was little shit. I even built a plan for myself year: earn about 5 gs and get I-20 for cheap-ass university in San-Diego. Now it seems like oblivion. I also applied for DV-2021, but my chances of winning it second to none.

All I have evee strived to be is either being professional wrestler, an actor, musician, screenwriter, film director, or just writer. Nothing out of it is working out for me nor it will.

2020 hit and I dumped all people I used to hang out with. Stole a girlfriend from some asshole, but ended up dumpling her. Not because she's bad, it's just me being piece of horseshit. She was really supportive, but I guessed she couldn't bear my depressed-ass no more, despite hee being depressed as well, so I cut her outta my life to not make her life any more shitter. She was still with her abusive fucker, she was on her way dumping him, but she took her time and they still together. The reason I dumped her was to not bring her down amymore (she complained about it) and because I felt like she was just bullshiting me and playing on both side. Now I'm ghosting her, but from time to time I stalk on her. About a week ago she started to make fun of me being suicidal and she running with this shit with her friends.

Sometimes I just want to grab a fucking knife or pitchfork and stab and slash all of them to death. I started feeling that way recently.

I tried to kill myself about seven to nine times, yet all this attempts was unsuccessful as you can see. Tried to hang myself with a shirt a month ago, but I failed. Twice.

Anyways, I'm a fucking piece of shit. I have no love for my family, no love my friends, nothing to strive for anymore and shit, shit and shit. Yadayaydayada.

Recently I've moved out from my parents, so now I'm also homeless. I'm thinking about getting employed and rent a room for myself, live an adult life and shit, but this seems to be a stupid idea since I'm going to kill myself in two or three weeks.

I have no desire fix anything or getting better at anything. I've lost all the passion toward life and my hobbies

 I slashed my wrist, my palm and arm are burned with cigarettes, I tried to hang myself, I tried to overdose on pills, I tried to fall out of my fucking window. All to no prevail.

I'm just getting high of liquor now and plotting my death. I'm gonna drink 40 grams of poppers, mix it with booze and die from whatever the fuck I'll end up dying from. If it won't work, I force myself to make a fucking slipknot and end this bitch.

I also found in the same notebook, a lot of detailed sketches examples include a skull breaking apart at the top with the brain coming out, and a heart this is hanging in this room with a single light over it, the heart is falling part and the bones under neath are exposed in the parts that have broke off.

Day by day it gets harder, as my sleep gets worse &amp; worse so is my sanity, in this empty room thoughts I had once thought were impossible fill my head keeping me up for hours. The depression, anxiety and emotional trauma, its the only thing I know anymore its starting to become too much on top of the stressful life I have full of health issues. I try to find ways to cope some better than others in fact this is a new one im trying, writing down my thoughts and feelings down as I don't like to be a burden to the few friends I have left.

Everyday I wake up &amp; look at the guns hanging on my walls and say not today, but what happens when I decide to today is the day. Ive let my emotions &amp; feelings drive away the ones I love most, ive been spoiled by having a very tight nit group of friends, but what happens when you have felt like you put too much stress on them with your seemingly pointless problems, you start driving them away because you plan on that fateful day coming soon as your mental status deteriorates, as much as it hurts oh so bad you don't want to hurt anyone so you push, push,push until SNAP! They break because they think you don't want them anymore but in reality you don't want to hurt them. So now I sit here alone in my room as all the thoughts once again fill my head, any sleep I do get tonight will be ruined by the night mares of something happening to the ones that I love or them crying at my funeral because as much as I tried not too I still managed to fuck up and hurt them, but would they really care if I died tomorrow, this is a cry for help no one will ever see until its too late.

SuicideWatch,"I am so desperate for answers and support right now. The pain all started about 3 weeks ago, but let me give backstory first. I was born with Hypospadias (and OCD but I’ll explain that part later), which pretty much means my urthea was on the underside of the tip instead of the top. I had surgery when I was 6 months old, which consisted of closing up the old hole, and created a new one with working tubes and everything. The surgery went smoothly. Recently, I learned from my father that the only reason they agreed with having surgery was because of complications with urinating, which could have lead to something fatal. In the end though, I was told nothing in the slightest went wrong during surgery. There was a point in my youth were I was afraid to masturbate, the slightest graze of my penis making me paranoid (This eventually subsided). During this period, I got an infection/irritation in the meatus which doctors presumed was from bacteria/germs in summer camp swimming pools, plus a painful rubbing of swimsuit netting. And here’s where the OCD makes its way into the story. At this stage in my life, I didn’t even know what OCD was, but nevertheless I had it. This irritation I had caused me a lot pain and distress, and my young OCD mind kept producing negative and repetitive thoughts on the matter. This no doubt in my mind made the pain feel worse, especially since I was so young and didn’t know how to control the intrusive thoughts. I went to a handful of doctors and urologist, and all of them said my penis was in perfect condition, and it was just a little irritation. The pain got so bad that the doctor who originally did my Hypospadias surgery was gonna preform a cystoscopy, which is pretty much a look inside my penis. I was thrilled that I was going to get an answer for this pain. After the procedure, I was hit with “everything is fine”. I went home not very happy with my response because I wanted to know the cause of the pain. The aftermath of the cystoscopy was very traumatizing due to the spasms/passing of air the penis does from whatever the hell they did down there. It hurt worse than before, and I didn’t even touch a swimming pool for the rest of the summer. Eventually, the pain must have gone away, and I didn’t think about it until recently. It all started the day after I stopped my Luvox (a medicine for anxiety and OCD). I was feeling in a very comfortable state to stop my medicine, so I didn’t expect anything worse than a little case of the shakes/anxiety for a time being. That day, after masturbating, I went to pee like always, and I was met with a awful pain while peeing and it worsened after. My parents told me it was because I was off my medicine but I didn’t think so. A week went by and no pain, until an entire week passed and I was in pain again from peeing after masturbating. Every since then, the pain is stayed and I feel no hope of it getting any better. It’s a constant burning sensation, mixed with a feeling of constant pee in my urethra. I make sure to pee as much as I can, but I always a feel the urge to pee. The more I hold in my pee, the worse the pain gets. I also keep getting random pains in my testicles. I’m at wits ends right now. The pain is getting worse by the day. I had to go to the emergency room one night due to the pain. They gave me medicine as if they were treating me for Urethritis (which I thought was the case until I was told I didn’t have any inflammatory cells in my urine), and some pain medicine. They did an X-ray of my stomach, and another ultrasound of my testicles. Ultrasound showed no problems. The X-ray showed that there was stool (poop) in my stomach l, which pretty much meant I was constipated, which I sorta was. They gave me Miralax or something for that. I went home that night still in pain. The next day I went to a urologist, and they gave me bullshit answers that everything was fine and it’ll go away. I’m fearing for my life because if this pain continues, I’m not sure how much longer I can take. It’s incredibly excruciating, and is preventing me from enjoying life. Whether it’s phone calls or hanging out with friends, or even working out, I’m meet with this pain. It’s so annoying because I have this horrible pain and all the doctors say I’m fine. My parents think it’s the medicine, but I think it’s more on the psychical side. I’m in desperate need of some answers.

\\\\\\Third is the lack of communication that is killing our relationship (from my side ofcourse, gotta thank the social anxiety) 
\\\\\\\Fourth is,i pretty much have given up on life,its only a matter of time before i off myself or do something stupid (don't share this with anyone)
\\\\\\\Fifth is no matter how much you tell me that i'm no burden,i still feel that i am, you are a great girl ,you funny, kind talented...etc and im only bringing you down,after you managed to fix your life,im trully proud of you for being so strong.""

I took all the pills in my house (ibuprofen - almost a full bottle, off-brand Zyrtec - maybe 5 at most, and then a months worth of my antidepressants). I laid in bed with my dogs, closed my eyes and waited for fate to take its course.

I then realized, I was having a bad day... not a bad life. Around 10 minutes later, I went to the bathroom and puked up the entire contents of my stomach. Went back to bed. Woke up with a terrible hangover. Slept for the majority of the day.

For the past 24 hours, all I've wanted to do is sleep. There is a pressure in my head - almost like what I felt with my past concussion. Is this a side effect of the pills I tried to take? Am I going to go brain dead? I thought I puked out all of the pills, and now I feel this pressure and I am starting to freak out.

I am terrified of going to the hospital. I am a teacher, and I need to finish the school year out and do everything on my end of the school year checklist. I am afraid that if I go to get my head checked out,they are going to want to keep me for a few days to be monitored for suicide watch. Will I be okay?

In March, I accidentily overdosed on meth and xanax sending me into a state of suicidal psychosis and screaming threats of self harm. These were purely drug related. I was admitted to a mental hospital and spent two days there while i detoxed. I have never felt popular. Ive never been to a party. I have a small circle of friends at my boarding school. Me and said friends are avid weed smokers and occassional psychedelic users and very aware of the dangers. Recently however, as Ive been home during quarentine, my girlfriend who had been with me through shoplifting alcohol and my overdose, broke up with me very suddnely and explained ho much of a shitty boyfriend I was. She has tried to convince me it isnt my fault entirely, but I dont believe her. I feel like a complete freak to anyone at my school and fear if they find out about my overdose I will be socially exiled.

SuicideWatch,"Okay. This might be a little long. 
So since I was 14 I’ve been suicidal. There’s been abusive moms, friends, and partners. There’s been a long history of self harm and hospitalizations (6 to be exact). There’s been dysphoria and internalized homophobia. But I’m 18 now, enrolled to go to my dream college in the fall with a $30,000 a year scholarship. But I still think that any day I might kill myself. 

On January 6th, after a community tragedy, I stole my dad’s car and drove it off the road into a ravine at 70 mph. I broke my neck, wrist, and ankle and collapsed my aorta (I have a stent and hella metal in my arm and leg now), but somehow I survived with just a few ugly surgery scars. I was in the icu for 2 weeks and an inpatient for 2 months, but got out due to a legal loophole. But recently I’ve felt terrible pain whenever I walk on my bad ankle. And I have to look at my numerous scars every day. 

So all of this in addition to the fact I’m going to be living alone 200+ miles from home in less than a week has made me think about suicide a lot. There’s no one to find me once I’m up there. What’s stopping me? I have a therapist and I am a client with the Department of Mental Health (DMH) but I can’t seem to reach out to any of my 4 providers, and after my last suicide attempt my dad told me thinking about it gave him depression, so that’s a dead end.

SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account. I’m a 21F university student. School and success have always been very important to me growing up in the UK, neither of my parents went to university and I was going to be the first. All my life I just wanted to be successful, and after I turned 16 this is where it all started to fall apart.

I did very well in my exams at 16. I got 10 A*s and 2 As, and it remains my most proud achievement. I won’t go into a long spiel but basically I was discouraged from dropping a subject at my exams at 18, to get into university, by my school. I was barely passing and I didn’t need the subject but my school would not let me take 4 subjects instead of 3, despite the whole country mostly taking 3. I had got an offer to Cambridge University and I failed it due to my bad grades. This is when I started being suicidal and when I guess my depression started. 

I took a year out and reapplied and got another offer to study at Cambridge. It was expensive for my parents to take a gap year but they wanted me to try again. I worked so so hard, but I panicked again due to the pressure in one of my exams and I barely missed my offer by a handful of marks. I ended up doing my backup subject and another pretty good university in the UK, but it was not my dream university.

I struggled in my first year of university and had to resit one subject in my final exams to pass the year. I was not helped by the university in any way when I came back for second year, where I am now, and felt like I couldn’t change my subject.

I’m now hours away from sitting my first final exam which actually counts for my degree and I just want to die. So so much.

I struggled this year academically also and got very little support. I barely revised and it is all my fault, I don’t know what’s fucking wrong with me I don’t know how I just never worked hard enough to study. I have barely done any work and I’m such a failure. I have no motivation or drive to do these exams now. There is an option to sit in September but if I fail I’m out of the university. If I do them now I can potentially resit in September. I don’t want to do any of this any more, I just want to die and never have to think about my education, my degree, my job, my success and my future ever again.

I don’t know what to do. I’m religious and have no idea how I could even kill myself. I live with 5 other family members including my grandparents. I am too coward, as always hah, to kill myself. But years ago I knew I would never EVER consider suicide. And look where we are now.

SuicideWatch,"**Disclaimer:** *This post has to due with sexual themes, so if this could possibly be a trigger for you, please do scroll passed. Thank you.*

Before I start, let me preface something; I'm one-hundred and ten percent a virgin. Don't assume for a second that I'm some Chad complaining that I get too much sex or something. I've never even hugged or dated a girl before, let alone have sexual relations with one. That being said, I'll start. 

I hate sex and being sexually driven. I'm seventeen, so my hormones are constantly skull-fucking me, no pun intended. I get aroused many times throughout the day and it happens easier than I'd like to admit. When I get that way I often make stupid decisions, or I'll talk to a person in the hopes of sexual gain whether I'm aware of it or not. I'll watch excessive amounts of pornography just to help get it over with so I can move on with my day. Does it keep me from doing things? No, I can live without masturbating, but it's so, so fucking annoying to be aroused when I'm trying to just go about my day.

You may ask ""Why do you hate it so much? It's one of the few pleasures people like us have."" or something like that. Well, quite frankly, I find that statement to be ignorant. I'd rather go my whole life being a virgin if it meant I could maintain what little innocence I have left in my being. To be able to pursue a relationship without having to question whether I only like them because I want to have sex with them or if it's because I truly love them. To be able to take things lightly and not always assume that the things people say are euphemisms and shit like that. I want to be able to look at a girl and think ""Wow, she seems nice."" or ""Wow, I really enjoy her outfit."" rather than ""Man, the things I'd do to her."" or ""Man, she is *way* out of my league."" It can be really, really fucking debilitating. I hate when I'm in public or with a female acquaintance and my eyes trail off to parts of her body as if they were fucking magnetic. I hate it, I hate it, I *hate* it.

I know being as young as I am may be a deterrent for most of the people on here. ""Oh, you're too young and juvenile to understand."" Fuck you. I don't care how young I am, I've seen and experienced more than I should have at this age, so I feel as though I don't deserve to be baby talked. Am I juvenile and ignorant in ways? Yes. But, for the most part, my eyes have been opened. And I can say, with every shred of confidence I can muster in my being, I fucking hate sex.

In the last three years I have been diagnosed with OCD Aspergers and ADHD my dad has cheated on my mum and left leaving us with little money. And I’m in a pit of depression. Tried to OD last year too and can’t get to school due to my anxiety and panic attacks (I’m 16m)

Every time I walk home I pass a bridge. I constantly have intrusive thoughts about ending it there (they have lessened since I watched the bojack episode halfway down, but it’s still there) 

All I want is happiness that lasts. Only thing keeping me here is my mum and how she would be destroyed by my passing and my art 

So my question is do the thoughts eventually go away? Or do I have to do something that I might regret.

I don’t feel as if I add to this world or that I ever will. I’m not smart, I’m not good at anything, I don’t have any hobbies, I’m a very quiet, boring and shy girl. I’m full of anxiety and it affects my everyday life to the point where I can’t experience or do things most people do. I’m very depressed, I’m tired all the time and I have no energy. My family situation isn’t the best. My dad has been emotionally absent all my life and recently he’s been physically absent. I really only see him during Christmas for two hours tops. I have daddy issues and low self esteem because of my father. I still have feelings for my teacher from a year ago and can’t seem to get rid of them. He was everything I wanted in a father. It hurts and I can’t stop thinking about him. My mother is bipolar and is a ticking time bomb. She stresses me out so much and gives me anxiety. I can feel the negative energy around her when she’s in her mood. I have three siblings and none of us are close, although maybe one of my brothers I’m kinda close with. The other two make no effort to do things with me and don’t know anything about me. I feel like all I have is my mom, the only family member that I have a true relationship with. She is all I have and is a good mom when she’s not in an episode, but it’s a hit or miss everyday. Living with her is so stressful. I don’t have any close friends. I have a best friend, but she’s a horrible friend. She’s very selfish and all about her likings. I have other friends, but they’re more like peers. I really only Snapchat them, but don’t talk and actually know them personally. I just finished my first semester of college and I met this girl and guy from my English. The girl became my friend and we really liked the guy. We both ended up becoming friends with him and in the beginning he was flirting with me. He told me that he missed me (this is during quarantine and school had been shut down at this point) and that he had a lot of fun with me in the last day of class. He asked to hang out with me a few times after quarantine was over. He even invited me to join him in a costume party for Halloween with his siblings. Halloween is far away, but I thought that showed how much he was interested in me. As the days went by, my friend was trying to get at him and eventually he asked her on a date. I’m crushed and hurt to the fact that he was flirting with me and then picks my friend. I hate both of them right now. It’s the fact that he flirted with me in the beginning. I’m never the first pick. I feel as if I will never have a relationship. I cannot handle my emotions positively and I can’t communicate. I have never been taught how to do these things in a healthy way. I have anger issues and take it out on those around me. When it’s over, I feel extremely guilty. I would say I have a nice body, but an ugly face. I have no eyebrows, a gap between my teeth and shitty hair. I also have scars from piercings. I feel ugly everyday. I am so shy and quiet that I cannot act like myself around people. I have no personality at this point. No guy will ever be interested in me. What makes me happy is kids. I love being around kids. I love to love kids and give them affection. I want to protect them and keep them safe. I want kids of my own and feel that’s my only purpose, but then I feel I’ll be a horrible mom. I need to help myself first. I’ve gone to therapy, but it never helped. I’ve tried an antidepressant, but I’m horrible at taking it. I also like to drink and smoke and I know you can’t do that when you’re on them. All I want to do is drink and smoke. Weed makes me laugh and I love to laugh.

SuicideWatch,"I have posted this as a comment and would like to reinstate this in a post.  Please look at your desire to live closely. Its very likely infinite and futile. Futility of your desires depresses you but the often ignored infinite aspect of it is what drives us through the worst and the best of the days.  More money, more plans/family for immortalising your being after your death, more people to acquaint and stuff to learn about.  Neither your worst nightmare nor your *lifelong* dream would fulfil or diminish this. You will wake up the next day wanting more, no matter how long.

I am not saying suicidal feelings are a lie.  I know you've been hurt tremendously or you feel you've hurt tremondously. But if you could come to acceptance with the infinite aspect of your desires. Out of sheer vigilance. A vigilance in vanity.  Like you have just born and you just see/sense stuff like a newborn baby.  You have successfully upgraded yourself from suicidal to depressed, in the least.  

There is a haven between your grief/rage and outright despair/refusal to listen to your calling to live.  A coward, an asshole, a depressed or even an insane being isn't a dead person because it can be a ""f\*\*k the world"" than just ""f\*\*k me"".  Let the world show a sign of apology and correction.  Let it show a sign that your desires are still sought and could be fulfilled to some extent over and over again.  Let it show the real culprits who have fouled your being into guilt.  You came in this world without bias for anything and you deserve to go off without one.

SuicideWatch,"For as long as I can remember, I've been mentally, verbally, and occasionally physically abused by my mother. I never really saw it as anything different from other parents, because I didn't know better. Eventually I found out that what she was doing just wasn't ok, and I decided to tell people. First I told a few friends, but they told the teachers, and shit happened and no one believed me and all that ended up happening was I got even more suicidal, and my mom got even more angry. This happened again, and again, until eventually I stopped telling people because I figured first, that they didn't care, and second, that all they'd do is tell more adults who would make my mom angrier.

Sometimes are worse than others and the past couple weeks have possibly been some of the worst, not sure why. I have nobody in my life who GENUINELY cares for me for who I am. The only love and support I have is entirely conditional, and in order for me to receive it, I have to act a certain way, look a certain way, be a certain way... and it’s really tiring. If I make the slightest mistake or get grumpy or upset or my fun smorgasbord of mental illnesses causes me to become irritable, my mother completely turns on me and starts treating me like shit.

I can’t foresee myself having any sort of future at all. The only dream I’ve ever had is the dream to be a singer but realistically I know I’m not good enough to actually achieve that.

SuicideWatch,"I love my friends and I feel lucky to have them

But their religious views make me feel so disrespected

They believe suicide is a sign of weakness and takes away the most precious gift given by god. They think mental illness is a choice. 

It makes me feel so invalidated. They are telling me that my struggles are a choice and my depression is a personality flaw. 

For most issues e.g. abortion or gay marriage, I can disagree with them and move on. I don't want religion to stand in the way of my friendships. 

But my mental health is so personal and sensitive to me, I feel personally offended and humiliated when they believe these things. Even if they don't say it to my face, just knowing that they believe that I am responsible for my pain, hurts. 

Most days I just live my life and I'm pretty happy. But I feel like I'm carrying around this heavy weight.

SuicideWatch,"I found out my boyfriend who commit suicide sent my nudes around to multiple girls in an attempt to flirt with them while we were together. Getting off to the fact he was cheating on me. He’s also done a lot of much worse things to me, which I won’t disclose. I just always blamed it on his life circumstances and him ‘not knowing any better’ but I’m mortified. He got outed for doing illegal things with a minor, that being me. I don’t know how to feel. I feel angry, like I should hate him, but a part of me just can’t. I just don’t know why anyone would do that to me. He watched my ex do it to me and me almost kill myself over it, then he did the same thing and just said I’d be so pissed if I found out. The same day he leaked my nudes he sent me a massive paragraph telling me how much he loved me. I feel grossed out. I also managed to not get into college because of the fact the final year of high school I spent focused on him, going through multiple break downs, and focusing on that rather than my studies. 

Yet I still feel emotionally drawn to him, almost like stockholm syndrome. I don’t know if that’s because he’s passed away, or if I’d still feel the same way if he was here. He needed help, serious help, but it just doesn’t feel real. I don’t know how to handle anything. Everything feels like it’s falling to pieces. I feel bad for feeling this way about him because his family are so nice, and they’re going through a lot. I just want to disappear. There’s probably more people who received those photos.

It's fucked up. I'm fucked up. I broke down in my bedroom as soon as the clock struck midnight when I realized that I was ""celebrating"" my birthday in isolation. I don't live with anyone else, I'm far away from family and friends, and I clearly still haven't healed from losing my dad last year. I meant to intentionally avoid the surprise my friends set up for me when I realized they were up to something, but I guess I no longer had to think of a lame excuse when an anxiety attack just swooped in right then and there.

I can't accept the good things that come to me because I suddenly feel like I'm a fraud. I feel like I've put up a front so well for so long that people can't separate the ""good"" from ""me"" when really, I'm worthless. I'm not actually worth jack shit. I'm dead weight without any direction in life. 

I hate how one moment I think I'm doing fine and suddenly I'm hit by these episodes of pain and self-loathing and I begin to lose interest in everything. I push people away because I don't want to tell them about my thoughts and feelings because deep inside I feel like I always talk too much or scare them off when I let my real shit out.

I'm fucking up my relationships with people. Not just friends even. The one time I begin to actually get somewhere with a potential significant other I go spiraling all the way down and I can just feel them losing interest in staying with me—and we're not even together yet.

I nearly killed myself when I found out that I had to stay a year back during my degree. I had no friends, and I had no motivation or any interest in I guess anything except gaming and music.I'm always glued to my phone looking at youtubers playing all those latest games which I couldn't play. I had no friends to talk to and talking to your parents about your problems will make them worry more than they already are. I got used to this lifestyle of mine and it didn't bother me, at least for while Somehow I managed to complete my degree and took another year to study for entrance exams. I did all these for my parents. They knew about it and what my interests were, but in this world you gotta find some job to sustain yourself. So gaming wasn't really a job, its like a saying in my country. And you can't really argue with parents. And at that time I was in cloud9 I guess that I somehow I got into a university ( I had no hopes in getting selected, I was already mentally prepared that I will be staying home and searching for a job).

So fastforward I'm living in Europe on my own for my Master's and it's been nearly a year with bad grades on my assignments and my exams. And I tried to talk to student council and some people in my class about it, but they just kind of said hang in there. I thought people closest to me would understand but I guess nobody does.

I’ve been drowning in agonizing pain ever since I can remember. I’ve always tried to hold on and look ahead and it’s never been worth it. How can I trust that it will get better?? 

I hate every single part of myself with every ounce of my being. It feels like everything about myself isn’t right. Like this body or life wasn’t meant for me. like the person I am now isn’t supposed to me be. It isn’t me. I’m trapped in a body and in a life that isn’t mine. It hurts so bad. I’ve always hated myself. I remember asking my mom when I was little what I would look like when I grew up because I didn’t want to look like me.

I hate my height so much. I constantly stress over it. I wish I was short like 5’0 tall. I can’t stand up without wanting to cry or hurt myself. I have this desire to feel protected and small because It makes me feel safe. Something I don’t have much experience feeling. 

I hate my face, my body, my personality.. etc.. 
Every time I’m around people I analyze everything I did wrong and I feel Shit. So I just don’t anymore. And even when I did it was a one in a while kind of thing. 
(Sorry is that doesn’t make much sense) 

Every night I’ve been praying to god that I don’t have to wake up the next day. That by some miracle I wouldn’t have to exist in this world anymore. 
I hate the way the sun shines through my window in the morning. I hate the beating of my chest. I hate the little things that remind me that I’m alive. That I’m me. 

I have tried committing die once before and I didn’t do it right, Which is why I’m still here unfortunately. I would try again and I want to but it’s so much work. And what do I do if it doesn’t work again? Go through so much more shit that I don’t even want to think about. Medicine, hospitalization, treatment centers, more therapy, more medicine. I’ve tried 14 medications over the past year and a half/2 years and none of them have worked. 
I just wish I never existed. That I never had the chance to be alive so that I didn’t have to experience the pain of being me. 

I told my mom that I hate her for having me. For making me exist. I feel bad but it’s true. I’m so mad at her and my father. Being alive is incredibly demanding and exhausting. 
Every single morning I wake up I want to cry because it’s another reminder that I have to continue on as me. And I hate being me. I hate it so fucking much. My life is excruciatingly grueling. Every day is a nightmare. It’s been like this since childhood. Ever since I can remember. 

I’ve never had true friends. no one wanted to be my friend even when I was little. in preschool all of the girls would hide from me in the morning and try to not be around me. i cried when my mom dropped me off because I hated it there. I remember running out to the car when my mom was about to leave and crying hysterically. Then in kindergarten the only person I thought was my friend didn’t want to play with me. I never played with anyone. Then two people who I thought were my friends would say ‘let’s pretend we don’t know you’ and then ignore me for a long time. I had a diary when I was little like elementary school and wrote about how much I was lonely and sad. 
I was taken out of school in middle school for because I was so depressed and lonely. I was invisible. Summary after that: I then joined a new school in 8th grade and stayed until 9th grade. I was then taken out again because of my depression a plan for a suicide attempt. I was homeschooling on and off but now am working on my GED. 

I started cutting when I was 11 and that was the only thing I felt like I had control over in my life. 
I’ve been clean for a few months but fuck it’s so hard. 

I’ve cut myself off from everyone except for my parents, my sister, and my therapist. I have no contact with anyone else. I figure it’s best so that people don’t have to deal with me anymore. I just want to disappear. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to do anything anymore. life is so exhausting.

I’ve been in therapy for about 8-9 years now, I’ve been using drugs for over 10, and I’ve been through a handful of medications to help with my consistently unstable mental health state; Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, Seroquel, Paxil, Lamictal, etc but I’ve never been sober really :/ I had 1 brief stint of sobriety starting 10/11/19 and it lasted 69 days- 61 of which where spent in treatment so like really only a week in the world, and most of that was spent locked up In my room, hiding. I’m aware that I’m manic, I’ve got a severe depressive anxiety disorder, pretty bad PTSD, just got diagnosed bipolar 1 I believe, yadda yadda yadda

I’m only 18 I feel like this isn’t old enough to be spending your winter and summer breaks burying your friends but I just lost 2 dozen people THIS MONTH ALONE, all overdosed with 1 exception; a heart attack. 

I’m no longer on the streets and I’ve got a roof over my head, I have access to food, running water, functional electric power, I have A BED- like a REAL MATTRESS with PILLOWS and SHEETS today like holy shit that’s insane to even SAY. Not long ago my forearm was the best pillow around and my backpack was my blanket, and anything was a bed- so I understand I’m in MUCH MUCH MUCH better circumstances currently. 

I keep reaching out for help with substance abuse, (DOC’s have historically been Ketamine, 3-MeO-PCP, and Oxycodone, but most recently Fentanyl, AcetylFentanyl, and if that’s not available, ONLY then, Smack) but like I’m starting to wonder which issue do I tackle first?


I don’t wanna be alive to tell the truth. The only reason I’m trying so hard is I wanna start a family of my own. I wanna be a dad, I wanna be a husband. And I can’t exactly tell my S/O “hey babe so listen, the only reason I haven’t left you devastated via my untimely death is because I just really wanna connect family trees and create life with you” or else like THE FUCK- THAT SOUNDS AWFUL to tell a person. 

But it’s the truth like this isnt for me. I’m not doing any of it for me. I DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE, but I wanna WANT to be here, you know? Im so conflicted and I feel so lost and confused. 

Since I was 11 ive tried desperately numerous times to take my life; hanging+handful of Vicodin going into 6th grade, leading to a hospitalization, another Vicodin overdose at 14 leading to hospitalization and then rehab, DXM and Xanax overdose 9th grade, still 14. End of 9th grade year, 15 now, alcohol + GHB + Alprazolam, 10th grade year DXM + DPH, 11th grade year there were a few- another DXM + DPH attempt that actually requires me to get recessitated and yet another hospitalization followed that then another rehab, then an oxy overdose while driving on the freeway which caused a horrible horrible accident, I had 8 total in the car and we hit the median and flipped and they still forgave me, then August of 2019 I tried like 5 times in a week with anything I could find in my grandmothers WALK-IN MEDICINE CLOSET/CABINET, and then got kicked to the streets where I overdosed on heroin trying it for the second time, and then begged to go to rehab- came back- did fairly well, then accidentally overdosed on GHB at school, then another accidental DXM overdose, and then finally March 18th at like 1am I overdosed on a bad batch of what I thought was Fentanyl or AcetylFet and had to get narcanned 3 or 4 rounds....

After everything I’ve tried dude, drug overdoses, hanging, slashing/stabbing main arteries, like SOMETHING up there won’t accept me just yet. Idk who the fuck is keeping me down here but someone or something is and I’m honestly not too happy with it. 

I wanna get sober, I want to WANT to live. 

Does my doubt overshadow my will power? Possibly...I have no clue what’s going on in my head. I thought I was more self aware but like my reactions to anything and everything are so out of proportion on either end of the spectrum, high n low, like something in my brain just isn’t right. Gears are turning but somethings stuck and shit isn’t working, yknow?

SuicideWatch,"I can’t take this anymore. I really can’t. I am so weak, everyone else can do it; why can’t I? This feels so weird, but the only place I can talk about this stuff is the internet. I’m a waste of everything. The world is already so overpopulated; what’s the point of me living? I’m not even living; I’m just alive. I wish I could go out and be happy. I wish that I could enjoy life. My parents were screaming at me about how I’m “living the best years of my life” and how I’m “wasting these precious monomers sitting inside” oh, let’s not forget the “when I was your age, I hung out with the other kids.” There are so many reasons why I *shouldn’t* be alive, I have a hard time clinging onto the good reasons that keep me here. I know that I could reach out and talk. I could go to a therapist. I was raised in a kind of “don’t share; don’t talk” family. Even the anonymous text therapy, I can’t even do *that*. I feel that the random therapist will hunt me down or some shit, I don’t know what I’m scared of. Trust issues, I guess; always keeping me back. Then again, “I’m keeping me back”; a random quote from some random teacher in the world. I don’t even know *why* I am like this. I don’t know why everything is getting worse. I can’t explain it. Maybe it’s all getting better and I’m not numb anymore; it’s been so long, I don’t know what emotions feel like. I don’t feel like it’s getting better, though. The suicidal thoughts are *way* to constant for me to be getting better. It’s all that I think of now. I’ll be looking out a window and I think “I could jump out. Should I jump out?” I always check myself.. but what if I stop? What if I ask myself the “suicide question” and I answer “yes” again? I mean, it’s not like anyone around me would be shocked. I don’t really know people anyway, I wouldn’t hurt anyone. My parents didn’t really do anything when I attempted. 

Does anyone else have that disc of self hatred? It replays a ton of insults all day. I’ll be self loathing and I think of an insult that I know I’m not.. but I tell myself it anyway. I am so worthless. People will easily respond “no! You’re worth it. Keep living!”.. Let me be honest, it doesn’t reach me. I read it and I continue with my suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I just need to rest. I can’t do that while I’m alive. I have insomnia, I take meds for it.. but it doesn’t allow me to have a restful sleep. If I don’t take my meds, I can’t sleep. If I take my meds, it’s terrible sleep. If I died, I don’t think it would have a strong impact on anyone. My parents don’t really care about me, they might be sad; nothing drastic. My suicidal [not close] friend might kill himself.. Maybe that’s why I’m living. I’m living so I can keep another person in this hell. I don’t want to be alive and I’m keeping him here. I can’t wait 80 years to die, if my natural life plays out. Why should I graduate and go to college? I’m probably going to kill myself. Why should I do things that impact the future?

SuicideWatch,"So here's what I did wrong.

I had a plan. I've been having one for months, years even. I wrote letters, texts put in drafts to send out at the last moment. I was supposed to be home alone for at least 5 hours. 

I researched a lot on how to do it. I was almost set on the night-night method because of how painless it claims to be. I even got the right materials. 

But every time I thought about it I backed out, it felt like I was actively violating myself. I thought no one would understand. 

It felt psychologically easier for me to deeply cut myself since I already cut, and take a whole bottle of Valium for good measure (I was already on it so I had easy access). It felt to me like no one would be surprised to find me bloodless in the shower since almost everyone knows I cut myself, it's as if they almost expect me to do something like that. 

My whole family was at a birthday party, which I didn't go to with the excuse that I needed to research something for a very important job I would have to do the following week. 

So first I took the Valium, which of course had the effect of numbing my emotions. All I felt was dizziness, dread, like I was already on my way out. I cut myself deeply, to the point where I had a ""fuck what have I done"" moment. But I believe Valium didn't make me see it clearly, since now I realize they were not deep enough. It would have seemed like an accident, even for me. 

And then my brother came home because he forgot his fucking allergy medication and was worried I was nowhere in the house. 

He found me and called 911 and from then on all I could feel is cold and I couldn't coordinate my movements. For a moment I thought ""cool, I'm finally dying"". 

I am now in hospital. Again. I sent those texts that were only meant to be sent if I wasn't around to face their consequences and now I can't face the people I love after what I told them.

He's one of my best friends and we have been talking and doing video calls a lot because we live far from each other, also because we're both in the same dnd group.

We are both not doing well and have hinted at these things a few times in the past. Lately he's been talking really negatively about himself. Usually we do so in a joking way but it's been getting worse. He takes a long time to answer my texts and he always seems distracted or far away when we video chat.

He had an episode where he wasn't online for days and I reached out to him and asked what was up. We talked a bit after but he's been very absent. That was one month ago.

He hasn't answered my text in nearly 2 weeks. He sent me a text essentially saying that something happened and that he needs time to think (he's struggling financially I hope it's because of that).

Hello. I'm a woman  from  Brazil, I don't speak English fluently.
Here is a short resume from my life till now: my mother is narcissistic to the hell and genuinely hate me and thinks the whole world has something against or with 
her, if you know what a narcissistic mother is you know is bloody nightmares. I don't have a dad. She (And my grandmother) mistreated me all my life, one sentence I heard the most is: you're a burden. Ten years ago I suffered from intense self mutilation
, I just since then end all this bullshit. But life goes around... I tried my best. I did therapy, I get prescription for pills, try church and volunteer work.
I got a full scholarship in one of the best colleges here, I'm proud of it but I'm also a dropout (she never congratulated me but for sure remember how shit I'm for not accomplishing it). I get broke, we live together.
My grandmother passed away last month (the such disease I don't like to say it's name) and so life has becoming something else... It's painful. Not because I m sad about it but the whole process.
I felt for my aunt and cousin who I love desperately.  They two are the best people in the world. I feel sad for disappointing they.
I'm miserable. Numb. 

I take a medice and my mind is kinda blurry so probably don't expresses myself well. I reserved a hotel room for tonight, got some pills and think about a  wristcutter. Scary the hell out of me if it don't work. No one knows I'm about to do it and the place I'm it's not in lockdown. So today is the day.",Today will be the day,t3_gr2vsd,1

I really want to just kill my self right now. Only thing stopping me is the consequences if it doesn’t work.

 I’m so gutted that I’m back at this place. I thought after that admission I wouldn’t be back in this situation of crisis. I thought I’d be okay. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s either 
A) I kill myself successfully and make everyone around me miserable 
B) I’m unsuccessful and I get sent back to the psych ward, just becoming even more of a disappointment to everyone close to me. 

I just don’t want life anymore. I just want to be with God. I want to not be on Earth anymore. Everything is so messed up right now, from covid to terrorism, and I feel too fucked up to be here in the first place. 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to talk to about this. I’m thinking of going to the councillor and telling her I’m planning my suicide, and hopefully she’ll send me to the mental health triage before I get the chance to actually fuck myself up. Why?

depression,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",t3_doqwow,0

&amp;#x200B;

\[18F\] I absolutely hate the way I look. I have always been dark skinned with small eyes and a roundish face. My sister on the other hand has always been lighter skinned with beautiful big eyes and lashes and great bone structure. My only redeeming feature used to be my toned body but after going to college I gained 15 pounds in 3 months and thats when my self confidence completely plummeted. Now I am fat, dark and ugly.

I have never been in a relationship (I'm 18) and no guy has ever shown the slightest bit of interest in me (doesn't help that my sister is 16 and already been in 2ish relationships). In high school all my friends had guys asking them out left and right. Me on the other hand- I don't know a single guy who would even consider going out with me. Surprise surprise- I didn't have a prom date for either of my proms. Every night the last thing that I think before I go to bed is that I'm going to die alone and the first thing that I think in the morning is how ugly I am. This has also affected me academically because I spend all my time obsessing over my looks, or stalking pretty girls on Instagram or talking to random guys online.  I'm hooked onto dating apps because that is the only form of validation that I have or will ever receive from the opposite sex. While it gives me instant gratification, in the long run it just makes me feel like shit because I know none of these people actually care about me. It doesn't help when the people I'm talking to randomly ghost me since it lowers my already low self confidence. I've had a few hook ups but I'm always way more emotionally invested and ultimately when it doesn't work out I'm heart broken but I have to pretend like I don't care- after all it was just a hookup for them right?

I honestly don't know what to do. I am physically unable to cry about this because I just feel so dead. I just want someone to hold me and tell me how pretty I am once. Doesn't help that I'm not very extroverted and struggle to make friends, especially with the opposite sex. So not like there is much else I can distract my mind with. I currently only have 2-3 close friends and very few acquaintances so I don't even have a chance to meet anyone outside of dating apps (which as I've said before haven't worked out for me). Not like my looks do me any favors when it comes to this. I'm always so envious of pretty girls with no personality have a shit ton of friends and even when I try so hard to initiate conversation/meet new people no one gives a fuck about me. I am tired of lying about all the 'crazy sexual experiences' and 'boyfriends' that I've had to people. I doubt they even believe that I've had a boyfriend judging by how ugly I am. I just want something to love me. I'm tired of always being the awkward one at parties and the person that everyone talks over. Everyday I wake up praying for my skin to becomes one shade lighter or my eyes one inch bigger or my jawline 1% sharper but I'm stuck with the same ugly face. This is consuming my life and I am physically unable to detach my self worth from my uglyness.  I'm sorry this post became so long. I just had to get it all out. Honestly I can't stand it anymore. I wish I wasn't alive. Or maybe I can change that.

depression,"So in order to understand what happened you need to know what's been going on for the past week. TLDR at the end 

After I went to a deposition regarding an accident that happened in november (which is another messed up can of worms) my car blew a head gasket. I was stranded in not my state on the highway. I called AAA and due to distance reasons and covid, i guess, I couldn't take it home nor to my uncle's repair shop. So they took me to the nearest repair shop and I had to pay to get told the same thing I already inferred it was. This had already happened once before and the repairs were at the point it was more then the car. So it sits in that repair shop till today so I can junk it for cash

So for a week I've been getting rides from my boyfriend (who is a saint through all of this and has really been too kind) and my friends and family. But i hate relying on people so i only ride with them if i truly need it. Plus I work nights about half an hour from where I live so it's hard on them I know it. Wednesday  i found out there's a bus stop that goes to a walmart. So I stopped asking for rides so I can go over there and get money on a prepaid Visa to uber. I lost my credit card a while ago but it's in the samsung pay app and I can just move my money around more freely. My credit card declined trying to get this card because it was ""suspicious activity"" so I was stranded at walmart and begged one of my friends to take me home. That was a bad time. 

 I was supposed to get paid and get a car. But my check had been delayed and all the bull hockey with my credit card. And the junk lots not doing same day pick up when their website says they do same day pick ups (seriously I called 8. All of them not doing same day pickups and everyone condescending me because they had the ball to advertise ""same day pickup""). .. I should if known something was gonna happen with this too. The guy never showed. No word from him. I took my losses and went home. He said he was asleep when I tried to call him and text him. I'm giving him another chance today because if anyone understands falling asleep on someone. It's me. 

This leads to yesterday. Going back on the bus to get told to get off the bus because I was going the wrong way (in a very condescending tone I may add.) And the bus driver telling me to pick a more stable dream career... I was at walmart. My card took and now I have a card i can use. I go on the uber app and... nothing. It wouldnt take. This has happened before so i give it a zip code and... still nothing. Lyft wouldnt take either so with a dying phone battery I called a taxi. The card doesn't work on the taxi either because it uses square and needs a zip code. He said to go in and get cash back and I rush in there. Keep in mind at this point I'm running on over 24 hours without sleep and i got off of work 3 hours ago. I run into the walmart and physically go to the cashier. The card got declined. On a 88 cent snickers.  After I just put in my last $75.00 onto it. 

I SNAP

Laughing through the walmart I rush to get my stuff and telling the cab driver ""im sorry to waste your time but this isnt going to work. My card declined again"" and I'm rushing he asks ""why?"" 

And I scream ""BECAUSE FUCK MY LIFE!!!!!!""

 Laughing like a god damn maniac into the walmart probably giving the nice driver a heart attack or at least putting him in a very bad mood. I'm now in the produce section leaning on some pineapples trying to breath through my mask. The world is spinning and it feels like I'm the only one in it. Tears stream down my face. ""This isnt going to happen again. I cant take it anymore."" I think. ""I screwed up. I'm trying to handle everything but I just cant. I fuck up and my life isnt worth saving."" 

After i ""calm down"" I'm more into a rage mode through walmart. Just any fucking thing could trigger me. Thank god there were no whining children or I could of ended up on r/entitledperson for screaming at them to shut up. I was out of spoons to give.  I cash in my checks which I didnt want to do because I have an overdraft balance I  didnt want to pay off yet because it dipped into my car funds. Just fuming and freaking the fuck out. After that I got a charger and a light for my dungeon of a room.  Get my card onto lyft and drive home at 11:30 am. 

These panic attacks are getting bad. I usually go into my car and scream and cry and drive around. Its soothing to me. I know I cant do that anymore but it hurts. Life hurts. This wasnt as bad as other things I've been though so idk why it triggered it. I'm making a therapist appointment and a doctors appointment monday so I can start feeling ""better""  the aftermath feels like I wasnt even in my body as the freak out was happening. Like I dreamt it. But oj no I was there. I know I was there. I'm gonna call the guy and apologize for my behavior because it wasnt his fault. And I screamed at him. The aftermath makes me feel like the scum of the earth because i couldn't suppress it inside of me. I just physically couldn't. I try so damn hard but how long is it trying till it starts becoming failing? I scare myself with these kinds of episodes thinking it may one day lead me off the side of the road into a river.

TLDR: due to a very stressful week dealing with rides and money  It all came to a end the second day I go into walmart and my card gets declined after putting money on it moments ago. I scream at a cab driver and have a panic attack alongside some pineapples.",Panic attack at a walmart,t3_gtcolb,0

depression,"On Monday I admitted myself into the hospital for ""suicidal ideation"" as they called it. 

I've been depressed for about 15 years, since I was 10 or so. I was finally diagnosed around age 17. It worsened deeply in the summer before my freshman year of high school, shortly after my father was diagnosed with cancer. My life, obviously, hasn't been all bad. But it was a downward slope from that point and I honestly can't recall a time since that I've been genuinely happy. In 2011 my mother began using pills after a knee injury. To the point she'd steal my father's oxy. In 2014 she graduated to meth. In 2016 I spent three days watching my father die. That broke me pretty hard. That same year, a few weeks before my 21st birthday, my mom told me to kill myself and ""make the world a better place"". I didn't listen. But I'd be lying if I said sometimes I wish I had.  I've consistently held on to the naive hope that ""things will get better"". As of yet, though, they've only gotten worse. I've been through several family deaths. Deep, toxic issues with my husband. Postpartum depression after I had my daughter, and much more. 

Most recently I made the mistake of falling in love with another man. A long-time friend. I'm not saying it was right. But the few months we spent talking every day were the happiest I've been. I won't get into  details for the sake of the readers. It would be long. But we were caught and everhtbjng came tumbling down. My husband gave me another chance but I'm not sure I wanted it. The other man said he deeply loved me and would wait. But he didn't. He got back together with his wife and ceased contact with me. 

I feel so horribly broken and lost. He is everywhere around me and I'm feeling the weight of every sadness I've been though so much more heavily. Being alive seems to be just a burden. Some people aren't meant to be happy, I think.

I don't have any other health problems apart from severe depression and anxiety which Ive taken lots of different antidepressants etc for, currently im just on venlafaxine. I have bad insomnia and sometimes hypersomnia, so I will be in bed by 11pm,wont sleep until about 4am,and will then sleep until 3pm.

The only time i go out is running weekly errands like shopping, and walking my puppy once/twice a day, but currently its too hot to take him out much as he suffers in the heat. The rest of the time im lying down either playing video games or flicking through my phone.

depression,"I guess what it comes down to is, I wish I had a shoulder to cry on. 

I constantly hear about how men’s emotions are repressed in our society, and I don’t disagree. 

But... I have never felt like I could express my own emotions either, at all. 

The way people talk about how men are told to “man up” and how they can’t express themselves, you’d think we live in some society where people encourage or at least allow girls to express themselves... this wasn’t true in my case, at all. 

I was raised by a super uneducated family in the middle of nowhere, Utah. Definitely a super patriarchal environment. “Strength” and “stoicism” (shallow bastardizations of those concepts) were prized above all. The absolute worst thing you could be, male or female, was “a pussy”. 

If me or my brother or my sister or anyone else cried, we’d be smacked across the face. “Cry, and I’ll give you something to cry about” 

As a girl, I honestly wonder if my emotions were even MORE repressed than my brother’s. Of course, it isn’t a competition, but... 

I kind of feel like at least in my culture (I still live in this bubble, although I’m living closer to the city in my own apartment now), if a girl cries, it’s immediately assumed that she’s being a drama queen, and nothing is actually wrong. You are screamed at, and laughed at, and frequently hit. If a guy cries, it’s assumed that something must ACTUALLY be wrong. (But don’t get me wrong! A crying boy will be laughed at and criticized as well, but not to the same degree...)

One egregious example: my parents TWICE refused to take me to the ER for several hours when I cried about a broken wrist I got when I was 7 and two broken fingers I got from soccer when I was 11. I rarely cry because I was conditioned not to, but when I did, they still thought I was just “being dramatic” and were shocked when they FINALLY agreed to take me to the doctor and they confirmed my bones were actually broken; I ended up needing surgery on my fingers because they seriously didn’t take me for over 24 hours. My brother, however, has never broken a bone, but once thought he broke his ankle when he was about 10. My parents IMMEDIATELY took him to the emergency room and when they found out he was actually fine, they argued with the doctors for hours, saying their son would never lie and he must be legitimately hurt. I have told this story on reddit before and people have told me that my parents must be narcissists and I must be the “scapegoat” or something, but I simply don’t think that’s the truth, because I have seen this in so many families in my church. Like my parents did a lot of seriously detrimental things, but this isn’t a simple case of favorite vs less favorite child. It wasn’t anything they were doing consciously. Girls are just assumed to be exaggerating, it’s a systemic thing.

Now I must reiterate that yeah I know that men’s emotions are definitely still repressed, boys around here aren’t allowed to cry either. But... 

I don’t know. I guess I really wish I had someone to talk to. Someone I could cry in front of. 

And people seem to imply that as a girl, it’s assumed I have that. And I don’t. And none of the girls that I know around here do either. We aren’t allowed to cry. We aren’t allowed to share our feelings. And we are even less allowed to express anger, or any of our opinions. In fact we constantly have to pretend to be 100% ok with whatever our brothers, fathers or boyfriends are doing, we always have to keep a smile. If we frown or accidentally drag our feet in sadness or frustration or anger, we’re labeled “bitches” and punished. Honestly, my ex and my brother and my male coworkers and my dad have all thrown tantrums quite often and it’s kind of accepted (nobody calls them “tantrums”, but they just get inconvenienced and start screaming until they get their way) and the women just have to cater to them... not to say all of them are abusive jerks, but men are given a pass here to yell at us and scream out in anger, but we women are really not allowed to bring up any grievances we have. If we do, we’re at the least “nagging”, at the most, satanic psychopaths. Seriously the women I know for the most part just walk on eggshells, do anything to keep the peace. In that sense it seems men are actually allowed to express their emotions more... 

And yeah I know that isn’t the case everywhere. This place is all I know, at least well. I am now dating a guy from a European country that definitely isn’t known for gender equality but is definitely not as misogynistic as my town, and I have left and gone to college and made friends from other states, religions, countries etc but this is the only one I know intimately. 

Idk. Like I said... I think every human being craves the opportunity to be vulnerable, to connect with others. I happen to be female and I am in desperate need of that as well and I don’t have it. And this idea society and reddit in particular seems to have is that as a woman I live in some sort of utopia where I can just spout my feelings and be supported, and nothing is further from the truth.",Any other women out there feel like they can’t express their emotions?,t3_gteawo,0

The pandemic has made it harder for me to find people to meet in an attempt to take the weight off my significant other who has to deal with not only me being around all the time (since I work from home) but my mental illness. I'm fighting to make progress and be on a better track of handling it better.

But right now, I'm fighting for closeness since I'm alone most of the time. I don't mind being on my own when I have to be. It's just when my significant other is there I want to spend time with them.

I'm not good with change, and they are asking for a little more space. I'm either over-communicating but not getting my point across or I'm becoming irritable and getting angry at them. 

I'm so used to us being together and them pushing me in the beginning to do things together. I wasn't so good with people in the beginning because of my pain and issues, so I understood why they did what they did. But now I'm used to that closeness all the time. 

I'm frustrated because this virus has left me to be by myself, and though it scares me to be alone with my brain it has also given me some independence. Maybe I'm relying too much on my significant other, but they have made themselves my anchor. It hasn't been easy the past month either.

I don't want to feel hurt by them wanting a bit more time for themself. But I also feel less communicated to.

Early this morning, my grandpa passed away at the hospital. My grandma was right beside him. He was brought in on Sunday and the doctors told my grandma that he had pneumonia. 
We lost him today at 3:00am. 

My gramps had a good life. 
He was joyous, caring, fun and loving. Boy, was he loved and still is. He loved all 21 of his crazy grandchildren with every single bone in his body. A gentle man, he was. He was a towering 6’3ft and a man of steel, a coach, a father, a role model, a fighter, a change maker and a grandpa - which he absolutely loved being.
I will say this - and sorry gramps - he could not cook at all. The man could boil an egg and toast some toast but that’s about it, besides making a Root Beer Float, which I don’t think really counts. He had a RBF every other day - I lived with my grandparents. Every time my grandma would leave the house, he would give me the face, the “let’s make an RBF” face.

I absolutely adore those memories of him and I, or him, my cousins and I sitting at the dining table or outside drinking the only drink he could possibly make with the sun hitting our faces, not talking but just living in harmony and love. Of course, RBFs weren’t just all, he loved popsicles, animals and gardening. He had a little - not really little - gardening outfit with a fashionable hat, some sturdy gardening shorts and mid-calf white socks. He would spend every single day in that garden of his. Proud of his blossoming buds, his row of tomatoes, his field of corn and his handmade greenhouse. He was 
actually quite obsessed with buying new seeds, every week he would get some more. It was one of his many passions.

He was a dedicated man.

I don’t know why I am making this post, feels weird but also it feels good to get this out. I’m a closed off person to the people in my real life, I can’t open up well... I am also a writer. My gramps journaled every single day, so it’s safe to say I got it from him. For him, it was his way of getting his emotions out, I understood that and I understand why I do it. 

Yeah, I am heart broken. 

I don’t quite know what to do other than cry with my whole body, write sad poems or posts, stare at my fish or just lay down and do nothing. It’s devastating. I live 8 hours away from him, there’s a global pandemic and a civil war breaking out in the States. There’s no celebration of his life because we aren’t allowed. 
How freaking devastating. 

I lost a big piece of me today. I lost my father figure, my grandpa, my coach, my cheerleader, and my RBF partner. I really love this man with everything. 

Guess I ought to buy myself some A n’ W root beer, Byers vanilla ice cream and sit in some lush nature, and cheers to you, gramps.

depression,"

My friend is 20 and we met in university shared student housing.
She had a boyfriend a few years her senior.
Her early life she was abused terribly by her mother and step father. her father commited suicide and she was blamed for it by her mother.


Her boyfriend seemed to be of good stock until about the time she moved to university.
She had unfortunate complications with a pregnancy and lost the baby.
According to her, he was never the same suffering from multiple personailties and blaming her for the loss of the baby.
Recently he has grown violent, paranoid when she is around other men he is jealous and angry. He has even gone as far as to rape her and threatened her with a knife.


About 2 days ago, another friend and I convinced her that it was in her interest and the abusive boyfriends to get him arrested, that way she would be safe and he would get the treatment he needs for his disorder.


She didnt want to go through with it. She felt guilty for all the upset that was occuring, and that she still loved him. She understood what he did, all the implications of it but she just wanted someone to cuddle and let her problems go away.


I relented and said that we should phone the police to discuss what options were available. She revealed only minor details to the police, but this was enough for them to arrest him, much to her dismay.


She has been distrought about this, worrying about his well being and safety, even when he was let out and found out to be home.


She has called me 3 times every day since, it is midday as of now and she has already called me once. I am not with her as I am home due to Corona but she is stuck down there. I have a friend who is close enough that he can chdck in on her, but he is growing numb to it as he has visited 3 times over the past 2 days, over the concern of her suicide.


I do not blame him, i am growing tired too.

I dont know what she wants other than to kill herself and im not there so i just phone up, talk and be useless.


I dont know how to help her. I fear there isnt long before she doesnt call me, and just ends her life. She feels so guilty about the situation.


As of writing this, she hung up on me so i called my friend who has gone round to make sure she doesnt do anything stupid. He is consoling her now. And all she wants is 1 of 2 people, either her Nan (who is dead) or her abusive boyfriend because 'not even my own mother knows me...


Neither me nor my friend know what to do to help. It feels like we are just helping her cling on and that nothing is being achieved. 
What should we do?
I have advised seeing mental help people, the hospital etc

I then begged her to leave but she started to cry and sob because I raised my voice at her. I then told her she had her own bedroom for a reason and to go in it. She then FINALLY ran out in tears.

So no one else can ever see

When people care for my worthless self

It feel is if a spear through my chest

There is no way out I'll be like this forever

Nothing will be the same not now not ever

I have done so little but feel quite sad

I feel as if knife has gone through my heart

I hide the days where I feel sad

Yet I feel pain

I want to live a normal life

But I still no that can't happen

I try my best have better life

Yet Still I feel down

I want to be happy but everytime I try I feel more pain.

Why can't I live a normal life thats all I want nothing less nothing more

Why won't this pain just go away

depression,"Hello there. You're probably here because you're struggling with depression, too. But there have been times in both of our lives where we've overcome some of the obstacles depression presents. So, as a disclaimer, I'd like to say that your opinion is probably worthwhile. There's likely a nugget of wisdom amidst what might regularly feel like failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking some relationship advice. I've been in a relationship for many years now. I love my partner a lot. But despite our connection and time together, I still regularly struggle with mental illness. This strains my self-esteem/identity within the relationship, where I feel like a ""burden."" Like an ultimately toxic person not worth the time investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Being told I'm not a burden only temporarily helps. Basically/essentially asking for that reassurance regularly adds to this overall guilt. It keeps on stacking, I see it happening, and I don't know how to just...accept it. Just let myself be loved, get over it, and focus on the better parts of living. Somehow, every time I need emotional connection/communication/comfort, there's a deep worry that \*this time will push it over the edge.\* We've been together for a very long time, and that hasn't ever happened. But I seem like too much, to myself. I want to ""get over it"" magically, but I legitimately feel badly about having been \*so much,\* it's like I have to compensate. And/or, definitely/absolutely get better (to redeem all of their struggle and time).

&amp;#x200B;

I think the worry stems from ultimately not knowing if I'm going to get better. I keep thinking I might. I keep trying. But I really don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me, if you can relate to any of this...How do you manage that uncertainty in your own life/relationships? What helps you feel like less of a burden and mitigate those burdensome worries? How do you grapple with guilt?

depression,"Trapped in a crisis and not sure how to get out

This sounds unfair considering the world situation but I really don't know what to do next and could use some guidance.

I feel like I've hit a stopping point in my life. I've been what experience what I assume is depression (but nothing diagnosed) for many, many years but there isn't much I can do about it. Half my immediate family also suffers and it's forced my sibling to miss a fair chunk of school.
My family also has quite a few other health and financial issues. I can't burden my problems on top.

I'm in my early 20s now and for the first time I moved out of my parents place and live alone about 9 months ago. This was because I never went to university and just went straight to working in IT. I managed to get a decent paying job eventually and decide it was important to learn how to live independently.

Looking back I think this was just me getting fixated on a random idea of escape because I really didn't like my job and wanted out. My entire department ended up getting let go from that job in mid February and I've been unemployed since.

I'm meant to be applying for jobs or working on stuff that will look good on a CV but instead I just smoke loads of weed every day, watch TV shows I don't really care about and attempt to play games I just don't enjoy anymore. I hate it.

I've always just stumbled from job to job and while what I do now is a good job with decent earning potential and I am pretty good at it it's in no way fulfilling and it just hurts seeing people put all this time and work into a project that is for a faceless corporation who couldn't give a shit about you and will give you not recognition for it. And it's not even like you do it for the pride, the only difference in the world it makes is to make someone else even richer.

I now have no idea what I should do next. I'm running out of savings to cover my rent so I could just move back with my parents. I could get another job in the field I don't like which I know will make me majorly depressed in about 7 or 8 months.

depression,"Hi guys! This is my first post ever and I've been feeling a little down lately : (

So let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt how much fun they had in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive and I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and crying, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one even bothered inviting me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled.

depression,"So before i start, i guess what i learnt from this situation is that my happiness has to come from myself and i cant rely on anyone else to make me happy. Others are there to boost it and to pick me up if i get down. 

I recently came out of a weird ldr that lasted 2 months where me and this girl talked everyday, like all day, called often usually for an hour or more. She made out she really loved me i mean she told me that, shed tell me she wanted me, and want me in her bed and wants to sleep with me all the time. Shed send nudes and so would I. We'd sext sometimes and say some lovey dovey shit she seemed to enjoy and i was quite happy to reciprocate everything because i genuinely did grow to love her. She complemented me on stuff no one has said to me before and made me feel special. And i did the same to her. Because imo she was gorgeous. She would make me make promises and reassure her that i was sincere. I thought it was because she was maybe a little insecure and just unsure if i was sincere (which i always was btw) and it turns out she was the one who wasn't sincere. Turned out she had a boyfriend who just doesnt give her any attention and so thats where i came into play i suppose. 

Like i know im only 21 but ive been trying to get a gf for a good part of 8 years now. I do t know if its just the kinda people i attract but its been the same story for me always. People playing with me for literally no reason, i dunno if i just attract sociopaths or something, that could be it? Idk. I feel like a bit of a clown tbh.

U know especially at uni when everyone else around me are getting gf's or one night stands on nights out (not that i want that) but i kinda feel like im just invisible. But im not, like i make people laugh and people seem to enjoy my company (im really not blowing my own trumpet here either btw). I just dont know where im going wrong, i feel like im the same as other people, like im not some alien chimpanzee hybrid species, im just human lol. Idek.

It sucks that the only person who i have ever thought actually loved me, was faking it. I wonder if anything she said about me was true, are my vampire fangs cool, is my deep voice attractive, is my athletic body attractive? Like she says she wasnt lying but yet why should i trust anything she says when she pretended to love me. Like how does that even work? How can u spend so much time with someone and pretend to love them? Like whats the purpose? Just some messed up fantasy in there mind? but theres a real person on the other side, why would u do that?

Anywho ive had 2 ways of looking at it. 1. The stuff she told me is true and i should be more confident in myself and have some self worth or 2. Im unlovable, maybe my depression really effects my behaviour more than i noticed and i am weird af (its hard to tell from the inside because it's just me innit?!) And the only way someone will love me is for them to fake it.

depression,"I'll first start with a bit of a background of myself. I'm 21 and recently dropped out of college after my third year, because of the biggest realization I ever had hit me. What am I really doing in school? I thought I wanted to find a job with my Psychology degree, but now I realize there is nothing I could enjoy as a job with that degree, so what a waste of three years. I really believe now I was just staying in college to avoid the next step in life, working until you die. And then I thought to myself, when could I ever enjoy work when I don't even know what I want to do anymore, so then everything that comes will just be a depressing job. I found myself all of a sudden hating the idea of work, because it is required to live life. That just seems unfair to me. Especially now because I would have to work just to get by with minimum wage probably for who knows how long. What a depressing existence I just all of a sudden realized. I also have been single my whole life so the idea of sharing my time with someone I love seems nonexistent at this point, and I don't know if I will ever find love, because I am very socially awkward when talking with girls and overall just really bad at getting out there. So that to me is some of the biggest reasons to live life; money and love. Without money, you can't survive in the world and without love it's meaningless. So what is the purpose of life when you are forced into a world with a set of rules that you have to abide by to live. You can't just live, you have to work and make money to live. But I have such an urge to not work because of the depressing exitance that working forever gives. It just seems like something that society has excepted and expected because no one can do anything about it. So I don't know what to do anymore if my existence on this planet is going to be forced to follow the norm, and there is no way out of it. Suicide seems like the only way out, because at that point it's over, but I have such a hard time wanting to actually go through with it because I will hurt my parents and family, who seem content with life now. And the next step to not working is becoming homeless and probably dying from starvation or freezing to death one night, that seems worse than suicide to me. There is no way to live on earth and survive without work, and the fact I feel like I will never find love makes it that much worse. I don't know how I can ever feel any different at this point because life seems so fucked up too me. This was definitely a rant, but if anyone has any tips to make life seems worth it, I with take them.

I reached out on this platform and a few other subs a couple months back. Here is my post. You can see in my post history that I posted it in several subs. I really didn’t think anyone would respond to me so I tried to put it in front of as many eyes as I could. I’ll do the same with this post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f18zg2/please_read_me_i_did_terrible_things_when_i_was_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I didn’t expect to get so much attention and replies. I am eternally grateful for the support and advice I received. And I apologize I didn’t respond to everyone. Trying to work through this gives me really bad anxiety, to the point where I tremble and vomit. 

I still hate my self and still can’t forgive my self. I feel now that my only option to move forward is I have to reach out to these girls and apologize. For the last couple of months I have been looking for them. I made a blank Facebook to try and find them, I was able to find 3 of the 4 pretty easily. For the one who I didn’t remember her name (CB), I went on a dudes Facebook who I knew befriended every person he could and looked through everyone of his 2,000 plus friends and looked at their faces to see if I could find her, and what do you know, I did. 

I will use the code names from my previous post to identify the girls. LC and CB are now married, and CB has 3 children. Also CB is an kinda a conspiracy theorist and her profile is filled with the deep state and Bill Gates is putting tracking chips in us, the works. That makes me nervous reaching out to her. LC is happily married and I’m hesitant to reach out because what if she has already moved on, and my message will bring back traumatic memories. 

Though I haven’t been able to find the 4th, DL, until I get a random call. I get robo calls but not often and no one talks to me anymore, so it’s highly unusual for me to get a call. I don’t know why but I answered this one and when she realized she called me, I could hear the anxiety and fear in her voice. And that’s when I knew it was her. It’s been over 10 years and she still has my number and I can tell what I did haunts her. For a recap she is the one who I met a dance party and while making out I put my hand in her pants without her permission. There is a lot more details about the incident in my previous post. She is also a Mormon. She is happily married with children and has become friends with some of the people I was friends with while in high school. 

Back to the call, she just said she had the wrong number and hung up. Though now that I had her phone number I was able to find her name on google and then her on Facebook. Seeing her face, I know it’s her and I’ve now got the chance to apologize to all my victims. I know I could call or text her, but I don’t feel like that is as appropriate because I’m sure my apology will be a couple thousand words and I don’t want to call because that doesn’t give me the chance to really format what I want to say. 

But I’m stuck in this step now. Every time I try to write out what I want to say my anxiety gets so bad that I shake uncontrollably. My perception is clouded with fear and self hatred. I’m afraid I can’t think rationally enough to compose a sincere apology letter.

I am so afraid that they will admit what I did traumatized them, and I don’t think I can live with my self knowing that. I have only suspected that and it was enough for me to want to put a gun to my chest. I’m also afraid that when I do they will use it as proof and oust me, which honestly I don’t want to happen, but that’s their right and I cannot object to that. If that’s what they feel like they have to do, then I have to support them. They are the victims here, not me. 

When I’m ousted I’m afraid of my friends and families reactions. I have been under the impression that if they knew the truth about what I had done they would understand why I had to kill my self. I’m also afraid that their rejection will push me over the edge of suicide. 

As of now I know I’m too much of a coward to kill my self, I’ve been there, tried that and I couldn’t do it. I love the idea and beauty of life but absolutely hate my self. I cannot continue like this or with my self if I don’t reach out. The way I’m living now is miserable, I want to move on but can’t.

I know this is about me, this is about me wanting to move forward, which is wrong and selfish. It needs to be about them, about what I did to them, how it was wrong and about apologizing to them. 

I don’t want to tell them that I am suffering because I don’t want them to feel at blame. Most of them are apart of the Mormon church and the church hasn’t always handled sexual assault and rape very well. From other Mormon rape victims testimonies, the church would rather suppress these incidents as the blame is sometimes moved to the women. 

But I also feel like if they knew how much I have suffered they would know my apology is sincere and would be more inclined to forgive me. But that right there is wrong. I feel like that is me using my suicide as a guilt trip for their more likely forgiveness. 

I am probably the most terrified that she will confirm what I had done traumatized her and caused her a lot of pain. I think that will give me the push and courage I need to actually go through with killing my self. But I don’t want to kill my self, I don’t want my life to end, but I don’t think I’ll be able to live with my self or with the rejection of my friends and family.
 
I would really appreciate any feedback or advice you can give me about how I can format it.

What my mind tells me is to try and make everything about them, not reveal any of my suffering and purely make my apology about what I did to them and how it was wrong.

But, my anxiety tells me to share my suffering with them so they understand that I am sincere and make them more likely to forgive me. But like I said earlier, that’s wrong and manipulative. 

Also, my suffering might bring them satisfaction as I have caused them trauma. But that, I would understand and be okay with that. 

But in reality, I am in no way able to think straight or rationally. My anxiety is out of control and I cannot get my self out of this depressive pit I’ve dug my self into. My existence is miserable and I don’t want to live like this anymore. That’s why I need your help and guidance.

I'm the kind of fat person that people refuse to sit next to on public transportation. I'm the kind of fat person that strangers harass. One time on the train, completely unprovoked, a man spit in my face, called me a whale, and told me to fucking die.

I'm the kind of fat person who lives in such immense shame about her body that I do everything I can to stay locked up in my home, even before the pandemic. I work from home, I don't date, and I rarely socialize in person. I try not to go outside. Sometimes I don't even get out of bed. I hate my body and I hate myself.

I live with my parents. Every day, my mother (who had also struggled with weight and obesity, but is now at a healthy weight) gives me a hard time about my weight. I don't blame her. I know it must be hard for her to see me, to have given birth to someone and watch them slowly become such a worthless fat piece of shit.

Every other day she says, ""One day, you'll just snap out of it. You'll get sick of being fat and depressed and you'll do something about it.""

The thing she doesn't realize is that I have that kind of moment every other day. There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not sick of my fucking body, depression, and anxiety. And every week I plan and promise myself that I'm going to ""turn it all around."" But it never happens. Why?

Because for me, depression is a crippling illness. I can't explain it but every time I try to do anything to improve myself, I become overwhelmed and I end up shutting down. And then I literally just lay down for days. It's like I'm the captain of a ship and I'm standing still watching as my ship slowly crashes into an iceberg and sinks.","""One day, you'll just snap out of it""",t3_gtb5s1,0
depression,"Hi everyone,  I (14F) was just wondering for some advice from anyone on what to do.

Around a week ago, my psychiatrist wrote me a prescription for fluoxetine (or as you Americans call Prozac), though there was no real pressure to take it (because my form of depression is moderate and I am not an adult). Considering I've been seeing my psychologist on and off for a year or so (with little improvement), I took them once the form was filled out a couple of days after (though before the whole psychiatrist thing I was against medication). Wrong move.

&amp;#x200B;

Within an half an hour or so I felt awful - sweats, nausea and shitty headaches… and then I threw up (which can be a common side effect when being introduced, but I rarely get sick). And it sort of hit me — do I need this right now? I did some research and the side effects aren't grand. I go back to school soon and don't want to deal with this awful sickness for a few weeks. I haven't touched them since, but depression has kept me from my studies and I feel my grades and overall performance slipping away… I can't concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and I feel so much strain like I'm about to have a breakdown. Some of you Redditors yourselves have commented not to take Prozac, but again… school.

depression,"So obligatory disclaimer, first post in this sub, but long time sufferer of bipolar depression and severe ADHD. I am a 23 years old, the only son, and the youngest of my (7) siblings. For what seems like my entire life, I've felt ignored, like a burden on the people I care about, and generally forgotten unless one of my siblings needs my help. Things really took a turn for the worse when my mother passed from cancer and my closest in age sister and I inherited her house. Obviously this was very hard on me, and I fell very hard into drug use as a result. During this period of time, I admit, I probably wasn't the best brother or son, and I took advantage of the kindness of my family mostly financially (never stole, just borrowed. Everything has been paid back in full), but within the last couple years I started to resolve my own issues. Getting closer to healthy has been the hardest battle I've ever fought, and I'm very proud of the progress I've made as of recently. Along with me regaining control of my life, I also got very involved in the trades as a physical outlet and as a short term career. As a result I'm constantly being asked for ""favors"" from my sisters including, but not limited to fixing their cars, fixing everything in our family home, helping them move, literally remodeling portions of their house (60 hr weeks while not being able to take work), and being strong armed into being underemployed by my dad repeatedly. I've never charged any of my sisters for work I've done from them, because according to them I owe them something. I almost never get anywhere near as much help as I give, and I've accepted that, but what I can't accept is being told I need to do more, being told that my sleep isn't as important as the favors they ask me, being told that I'm not allowed to take a few days for my mental health, being ignored in conversation, being treated as a literal child unless they want my help, and basically never being allowed to make decisions for myself without being severely reprimanded. Like it's getting to the point where I can't even make plans with my friends for an hour after work, because ""I've got too much going on at home."" They even try to control how I spend my hard earned money, but don't know how hard my job is (commercial carpenter), and don't care how tired I am when they ask me these favors. I feel like I have no privacy, no me time, and dwindling self worth from all of this. I honestly don't know what to do short of walking away from all of them, but this isn't an option, since the sister I live with and I are the only ones maintaining the bills for our family house. I've talked to all of them about considering my mental health, and how physically tired I am before they ask too much of me, but all of those conversations just result in me being told I'm acting selfish. If I knew becoming healthy would make me this miserable I'd have gladly just stayed a low life loser.

depression,"I went out to a party for the first time in probably about 8 months. Let me preface this by saying I'm young but the years after I graduated high school I partied pretty much every weekend which. I've always had social anxiety so whenever I went out I had to drink. This has led to a couple of embarrassing nights. Nights wherever I've fought, blacked out and done super embarrassing shit, and just pure stupidy. Nights I seriously regret and make me feel like a shitbag human being. So I've stopped drinking and going out. I've been pretty much just working and that's it, well I was up having some really tough times with my thoughts. So I said to myself lets go for a ride whilst in the middle of the ride my phones blowing up and its all my buddies saying come to so and so. I usually make up some bullshit excuse and don't go. Well, tonight I said fuck it and went over, saw people I haven't seen in a couple of months to a year. I didn't drink at all and the night was going well, people were telling me how much they missed me and hyping me up you know how it goes around, drunk people. None of my friends know I'm going through some mental issues, and they're bringing up crazy times that we've had together. Honestly, none of it was bothering me and it actually made me feel better, being asked how come they haven't seen in me so long and all this other shit. As soon as I got home I was just overcome by the feeling of shame and guilt. The shame of the shit I've done drunk, and the guilt of some of the shit I've said to people. I don't know, I know deep down I'm not a shit person. But some of the things I've done fights, being a dick to people, etc haunts me. I've told the people I was a dick to sorry and such. I just can't get away from these thoughts though. Especially knowing that some people only know of me in that light haunts me. I'm ashamed of myself, self-conscious, and anxiety-ridden 24/7.

depression,"I keep seeing discussion on how people with mental illness are toxic and shouldn’t even be touched with a 6 inch pole, but it’s this same exact attitude that leads to emotional and psychological abuse towards mentally ill people.

Not everything bad that happens in a relationship between two people is going to be on the shoulder of the one with depression. We are not magically invincible from being treated like crap the moment we develop depression. When a person starts being toxic towards a person with depression they  don’t go “oh this person has depression, fair enough, I’ll go somewhere else”. 

I wish there more discussion on how mental illness is exploited in relationships. How having a partner with depression make the other person think, “I’m not being a jerk, this person just have skewed perspective on me because of their depression”. That is psychological abuse. 

The “their mental illness is not your responsibility” narrative created an us vs them tension and creates an “other” group that continues to silence the voices of those with mental illness that rightfully demands to be treated with equality and humanity.

Mental illness advocate advocates to de stigmatiz mental illness treatment, but we treat people with mental illness themselves as second class citizens.

Fuck. Even mass shooters were found not to be mentally ill despite people and news media pushing that so hard. Turns out they were completely sane, but hateful men who wanted to kill.

We jump so quickly to pathologies/arm chair diagnose someone else or scapegoat someone’s mental illness because that is much easier from having to take a good look at ourselves instead.","No it’s not my depression, you’re just being really shitty right now.

depression,So this is going to be a long story so sit back and relax. So I met this guy (Nathaniel) in preschool and we didn’t like each other we were always fighting well fast forward a few years to eighth grade and he’s dating my friend and we constantly competed for her attention. So me and him ended up becoming best friends in the process and they broke up and eventually she stopped hanging out with me. Then high school came along and he got feelings for me but I didn’t feel the same and I ended up getting into an abusive relationship that I was trapped in two years later sophomore year he still had feelings for me and I ended up getting out of that relationship. So eventually I started liking him but by the time I started liking him he didn’t like me back but not only that I had told my friend that I liked him and that I wanted to date him and he told me he might date me then things went downhill quick I found out they were talking. So they both told me that they wouldn’t date like they both promised me and I was like OK but I need to take some time for myself so I took two weeks away from them because I was stressed. So when I came back he asked her out even though he told me he wouldn’t and I felt betrayed because those were my best friends and they straight up told me they would not date and then they did anyways but you know they didn’t work out. So now I’m in junior year of high school and I know I’m in high school I’m gonna be plenty of guys but I really don’t know what to do in the situation because it got worse. So it got to the point where he was basically my only friend and we do and talk about everything together and he still has feelings for me or at least he did I’m getting to that. So basically early this year I started dating a boy named Cayleb and he had a sister named Earris sadly they had to move away to another state and I had to break up with Cayleb so I got into a relationship with another abusive guy but me and Earris were best friends and we talked every day and we told each other everything just like me and Nathaniel. Earris and Nathaniel didn’t have the best relationship like they were friends and all but Nathaniel got annoyed by her and wasn’t really interested in her. Well eventually one day Nathaniel asked me out and I said yes because I wasn’t really into him but I knew I could trust him and I felt like I couldn’t trust anybody but him but the next day my ex was trying to kill himself because I was with Nathaniel so Nathaniel said I don’t want to do this if someone’s going to try and kill themselves maybe we should wait and I agreed. Then he came to me telling me he’s obsessed with his ex Tracy still then a few days later he said he’s over her and he was trying to get with me. And we were flirting and he even told me he loved me but he was scared to get with me that’s initially why he got with my friend instead of me in the first place the year prior to this. But you know he was still trying to go out with me and I was gaining feelings for him and I had planned a date with him. I Was actually supposed to go on the date with him tomorrow but things changed and shit came up. Today I was talking to him and he tells me he got engaged to Earris and I’m like well what the fuck you didn’t have feelings for her you’ve been obsessed with me and she’s my best friend. So he told me it started out as a joke and they were jokingly engaged but then they started flirting and he had feelings for her even though they only talked for a few hours and then he decided that he never had feelings for me all along and he just thought he did and he was now going to drop me to go for this girl and this girl knew that I liked him as well and she did the same thing so the only two people I could trust fucked me over and he did this to me again. It’s not even like I usually have feelings for this guy I just see him as a friend most of the time but then he gets feelings for me and I start to like him but then he gets all scared of dating me and such and he stops having feelings for me and then goes out with one of my friends and fucking betrays me. But I can’t drop him because he’s the closest person I have I really want to drop both of them but the one guy is the closest person I have and I don’t really have anybody else but if he’s going to keep toying with my emotions just because he can’t decide whether he actually wants to date me or not like I don’t know what to do. Tells me that he scared of dating me because he’s afraid he’s going to accidentally say something bad and hurt me and it’s going to ruin what we have but he has no problem impulsively dating girls that he’s only liked for a day. Anyways I start talking to the girl Because he had been asking to take me to dinner anyways because he felt bad and turns out she put him up to it so I was like fuck no I’m not going to his dinner why the fuck would I go to dinner just because he feels bad because he fucking betrayed me because he likes another girl that would just make shit awkward so then I’m just like you know what I still care about him but this other girl like me and her are really close and she would drop him and hurt him over me because I’m hurt so I decided that I need to drop that girl so she doesn’t hurt him and break things off with him because at the end of the day I still care about him and I don’t want anybody to hurt him. Usually when a guy does shit like this to me I hurt them back and ruin their month or maybe even a year but every time he’s done stuff like this to me I couldn’t bring myself to hurt him or get revenge. I just don’t know what to do because I’m afraid that this is going to happen again because I’m not stupid I mean obviously his relationship isn’t going to work out but I don’t wanna be any part of that but what if he starts doing this shit to me again what if he tells himself he likes me and he truly believes that he likes me but when it comes down to it he really doesn’t like me and he just hurts me again because at this point I mean him and Earris were the only two people I can trust but now I can’t trust anybody because those are the only two people that hadn’t really fucked me over or at least not in a long time for Nathaniel‘s case. I mean the first time he did this shit to me I for gave him but I don’t know if I can now. And the thing is it’s like I fucking resent him now and I feel bad about that but it’s just he can’t do anything to redeem himself ever like he’s not gonna be able to do anything to make this up to me but I don’t wanna have this grudge between us for the rest of our lives so what can I do to get over this but not distance myself from him or hurt our friendship.,I feel so betrayed what do I do?,t3_gtamfx,0

depression,"My apologies if this doesn’t fit this sub, and also that I’m cross posting it a few places, but I just need to get my thoughts out. I’ve always known my dad was depressed to an extent. That he got anxious. But I got anxious too. My wife suffers from depression and anxiety, and it doesn’t overwhelm our lives. But I learned last night that these things have been overwhelming my father’s life and coming to grips with it is so difficult.

He has been having a tough time at work for a while. But this is a guy who raised six kids. Beat cancer twice. He’s provided for our family and been an example of what a father should be to me. I’m the man and father I am today because of him. Even in my late-30s, I still kind of viewed my dad, a big 6’4 teddy bear, as a super hero. But stress and depression and anxiety and mental illness has boiled over with him. 

We ended up in the ER last night. Of course I couldn’t go in because of covid-19. He was (pardon me if I use a term in correctly) acting manic and going through thought loops, repeating himself, interspersed with crying and yelling. And it’s all because of being treated badly (at least he thinks he is) at his job. That’s it. And when I tried to explain that his kids matter and grandkids matter, and none of us care about how well he does at his job (he could retire today and be ok—granted they would be on a fixed income, but he would be alright), he told me that his job does matter as much as all that, and then he burst out crying. I think that’s when I realized how bad it was. He said he wanted to kill himself, but wouldn’t only because of his life insurance policy (which I guess excludes it).

I wish they could’ve kept him at the hospital, but he claimed he wasn’t considering self-harm, and the meds calmed him down. The doctor said he hasn’t slept for a couple of days and just needed his anxiety down. I was hopeful when I got him in the car all would be well, but it wasn’t. More ranting and crying. And I learned from my mother that this wasn’t the first time. Not something new. It has been happening for years and I didn’t know how bad it was. 

He’s agreed to see a professional Monday. I slept maybe an hour last night. He wants to have a big talk today about ways to go after his employer (I am a lawyer). But I’ll tell him what I’ve told him before: Being crappy doesn’t mean you have a legal claim. And I know how that will go. I’m dreading it. I just wish they had kept him for a psych evaluation instead of needing to wait until next week. I wish I understood how had it had been and for how long. I know he isn’t choosing this, and that’s it’s mental and emotional torture for him, and I feel guilty for being angry at him.

I’m not sure what is next, or how to handle it. I don’t feel strong enough.

But I’m just rambling now. I just wanted to get my thoughts out to some kindly internet strangers. My heart and soul goes out to those who suffer like he does. But like him, you are loved (so loved).

depression,"I recently picked up on Reddit now that I feel I have the time to often check it, and because of that I made this anon-like account for, ya know things that I don't want to be public about me. I know this will get lost in the void of Reddit, but I know it feels slightly better when writing this down. Somehow, it does.

People often say that writing it down like this will make you feel better. Or that going to sleep will make you feel better in the morning, and that things will pass. But it always comes back. And i'm sick of it.

Let me try to put this in words that will make you understand... and I really hope (but doubt) anybody I know actually see's this, because i'm gonna try to make this pretty descriptive...

In January of 2018, I was a Freshman at a charter school that went from K-9, so there was no real hierarchy or higher status above me at this school. For a long time, I was known as the kid who would be loud and disruptive, and always trying to be funny. It worked sometimes, but I began to tell around 8th grade that people were sick of it, and I felt hated without being told so. 

I don't know what happened, but one day I just broke. I came to school after Christmas break with suppressed emotions and a quiet demeanor, which I know must have seemed odd for my peers. I often stayed silent, with my head down, and just working on school work to keep my mind off what I was feeling. I didn't eat, instead I would either put my head down in the Lunchroom corner, or sit outside, rain or snow, on a single bench and just watch a field of nothingness.

Every day, I would walk my way home, and avoid talking to my father, who almost always stayed home, as he is a retired vet who has medical problems and such. My issues with him would take a long time to talk about, he's not abusive or non-loving, he's just not right to me, and I don't like being around him. 

Nonetheless, I would do whatever chores that were needed to be done, and just lay in bed watching YouTube on my phone, trying to keep my mind off things. When my stepmom comes home (who I should mention is a really good mom, and I love her. So don't think she's bad at all...), I would try my best to pretend i'm busy, and when I have to talk, I act happy and normal, however I did say I was often tired. I went to ""sleep"" pretty early those nights. And I remember at one point or another for some reason I began watching clips on self harm, and suicide. Something about those topics always were interesting to me on a psychology standpoint, and the next thing I know I was screwing out the razor from my pencil sharpener, and I began cutting my arm. It felt, painful, but it did feel exactly how other people  describe self harm, it translates the mental pain to physical pain. Because it was winter, I had no problems hiding this from people around me. We had to wear a school branded jacket all day in class anyway, and I've been known for preferring to wear hoodies in the first place. 

Sooner or later, I began thinking about suicide. I remember some nights where I was researching about what pill hurts the least, as I wanted to die, just with no pain. Now I understand it's basically impossible to die without some form of pain. Every night, I contemplated and tried mapping out plans on how to kill myself. My Dad's medical problems ensured that we had a surplus of medication all over the house, so it wasn't difficult to sneak a bottle of Tylenol past my parents. For a while, I would carry a bottle in my bag, and whenever I was feeling really fucking bad, I would pop one in my body, making a system that I thought would outcome to; ""if i'm feeling such pain all day, the more pills I take, the better chance I have of dying"". It was a stupid and flawed idea, obviously.

While these weeks were going on, there were obviously some people who reached out to me. Some teachers asked why I was so quiet, and I just told them I wanted to work harder. While other students, some I didn't know would have cared about me, reached out to me as well. I don't want to say that these people really ""hated"" me. I was never bullied there. It's just the people that I thought I was annoying were more just disliked by me. I guess not so much though, as even a girl that I thought really hated me because of something I did two years prior, she was the first one who asked if I was okay. I would go from class to class, and she would sometimes confront me and try to understand how I felt. I knew why she was doing it, because I know that she dealt with the same issues.

She was the only one that I felt really cared for me, and I didn't understand why. I remember there was a day when she saw my arm, and it got me really scared that others would hear about it, or worse any teachers. Today, i'm pretty sure no teachers knew about it, but I'm quite sure that other students knew, in some way.

Over a span of two months, I had two (albeit weak) suicide attempts. Nobody knew about them, but i'm sure some could have thought that that's the path I was thinking of. While in this depressive state, I realized my grades were becoming really good. Most likely because of me wanting to suppress my thoughts by working. Yet, I was not feeling any better. My best friend began coming out to me at lunch and asking to please talk to him, but I ignored him. I felt so bad. I felt like I was putting him in corner, and forcing him to befriend other people, which is kinda what happened. He more started talking to the people that were kinda my friends. You have to understand that at this school, there were not a lot of students in the grade, so just about everybody was a part of one big clique, split into little subgroups. We were like a family.

Here on out is where I made my biggest regrets in this story.

I feel that I put the people that I loved lives in danger.

I was not in a good place.

But for now, I really need to stop typing, because this is getting too long, it's late, and i'm already feeling bad enough as it is.

For anybody (I doubt there is anybody) who read this whole thing, thanks for trying to understand.

If I feel like this again, and for all I know could be tomorrow night, I might continue whatever this is.

Know that there is no happy ending to this story, because i'm still not in a good place. Maybe not as bad, but still bad. In fact, I think the past three years have ruined my life. But maybe I could let you know how I did that later.

Please don't comment on this reassuring me that life will get better, or that i'm a good person. You don't know that. For all you know i'm a child killer. Just know that I love you, I love you for reading this, and I love you for existing. I will refuse any love back, because I don't feel I want that.

Everything just hurts.

depression,"As the title says, I'm doing OK. I'm not great, I still struggle but I just wanted to say something to all who are suffering like myself. 
I've worked hard for so long. I'm 29F and I was diagnosed at 15. I didn't have a great life growing up, my dad was physically abusive and my step dad was verbally. I'm sure he would have escalated to physical abuse but it's hard to get away with it when my own brothers and HIS own kids warned what would happen if he did. I was told I wouldn't have kids when I was 16. My bio mom didn't raise me, but i was never really allowed to ask and the whole story is another chapter. 
When i graduated high school i joined the military. I buried my depression to prove to some of my family i would amount to something one day. 
Today i have a wonderful husband who sadly deployed at the moment. I've been going to therapy for the past 6 years regularly but due to covid the last time I saw my therapist was in Feb. I got to see her yesterday and filled her in on the past three months. It included a hard fallout with my MIL and SIL and it led to me cutting them out of my life with hubby's knowledge and understanding. 
My MIL never worked for anything in her life. Her father took care of her till he passed. When we had the falling out, she had the nerve to insinuate that I have used her son to do what I have, and it pissed me off so much. And I got to thinking about my life since I left for the military. 
I didn't have a drivers lisence and therefore no car. I changed that on my own. I got my license and purchased my first car shortly after. I got my AA with the tuition benefits I recieved from serving in the military. Yes my husband has helped me build a fabulous life, but I served my time in the military and I earned my AA on my own. We bought our first house together last year. But as I stated above, my husband is deployed and even if he isnt over seas, he is constantly gone elsewhere. I have had to pay bills on my own, clean the house, take care of our dogs, and grocery shop and maintain my grades in my classes, which I did. I cannot rely on my husband due to his commitment with the military but that's ok. I'm also the only one of my moms 7 kids who has never had to move back in with her after high school and the only one (who can have kids) who doesn't have kids. 
Im not 100% happy and OK but I am getting there. I still struggle and I still have to fight to get out of bed sometimes. But I'm doing it. And I'm doing it (somewhat) on my own. My husband cheers me on and encourages me even if hes not physically with me. It's taken a long while for me to realize how wonderful he is and has been these past 9 years together and he pushed me to start therapy. 
But I want to say this: if I can fight and keep fighting, so can you. You can do this. WE can do this. Together we can fight to see the next day and work on us.

depression,"I guess I’ll start a couple years ago. I’ve always been a little more moody and irritable and sadder than most people as far as I could tell, but it wasn’t until just a couple years ago I started to realize it might be depression and not just edgy teenager shit. In November 2018 I broke up with my girlfriend (my choice) and ended up getting a crush on a new girl. January 2019 I became officially radicalized and became an anarchist-communist, which woke up something else in me. I realized just how shitty the whole world it is and I just became increasingly depressed. Around May and June I started visiting a therapist for anxiety and “”minor”” depression, and my crush and I began talking. She then lost interest in me, I started stressing about college coming up, and I got a super shitty part-time job, which all culminated in me being super suicidal. I went so far as to go to Bass Pro to try and buy a gun, but I chickened out. Told my therapist, then had to tell my dad, and I got hospitalized more or less voluntarily for a week. I was feeling good when I first got out, but it’s gone downhill since then. Luckily in the fall I met another girl in my class, we’ve been dating since January and I love her so much and she’s definitely been helping more than I could ever say. Even still, I’ve become more and more depressed and outright suicidal. I know exactly how I want to kill myself but I can’t ever get the courage up to do it. I still want to live, at least partially, I just wish I was someone else in a different world. I’m an incredibly shitty person and I wish people would finally realize I’m not worth loving, even though I love feeling loved. I know I don’t deserve their love. I’ve always had a super irrational phobia of both veins and alcohol, blood and drugs, etc. And yet as I’ve grown more suicidal, most of my fantasies now involve me getting drunk and driving off a bridge, slitting my wrists, shooting myself in the head, overdosing on medicine, hanging myself, just getting high and drunk as shit so I can finally get the courage to finally fucking kill myself. I just want to be dead, but I don’t think I do. I want to be happy but I feel like I can’t, so I’d rather be dead than depressed. And I upset my girlfriend tonight and she doesn’t want to talk to me (it’s only been a couple hours but I’m incredibly sensitive to all kinds of pushback and I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for hurting her), and I wish I could just cry to let it out, and I wish I could tell my therapist or psychiatrist or girlfriend or dad or someone what I’m going through without hurting them and without being hospitalized again. I just want to not be here, not like this, and there’s nothing I can do. I’m so lost.

I’m a 20 yr old male &amp; she is a 19 yr old female. This girl that I met 4 years ago moved &amp; now she said she’s single. We’ve always liked each other. We met in a hospital in late 2016. However, she had to move due to family reasons. She used to live 25 minutes away from me when we first met. But she was taken back then. Now it’s 100 miles from my place to her town. She lives in a rough neighborhood so I’m a little nervous about going there. She said she wanted to spend time together. I was willing to do whatever it takes to make this work. I’ve waited 4 years for this opportunity. No other girl has ever liked me back. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me &amp; I wanted to make it work. I prayed that God will have us reunited with each other again soon one day. I was also looking for a job opportunity &amp; looking into acquiring a license so that way it would speed up the process. I was hoping that this would prove to her that I was responsible &amp; making a legitimate effort towards our potential relationship.

We live in Illinois(United States) &amp; the state is still under lockdown, meaning that we can’t meet up still. It keeps getting pushed back more &amp; more.

depression,"First of all sorry for the weird title but I couldn't sum it up better.

So I noticed the last few weeks that my depression has gotten better, to a point I want to meet friends and generally get out of the house more.

I'm also medicated and in therapy which kinda helps, I guess.

but more baffling to me is how I can accept my depression now.

For years and until recently I would call myself out for *faking* my depression to get attention.

despite seeking professional help a few months ago and my therapist making it very clear that, in fact, I have major depression I still would struggle with those thoughts on a daily basis.

My new mantra is, I'm not thinking I'm faking it to get attention anymore,

instead my new thought process is more something like this ""You are a depressive, manipulative asshole that uses his illness to get the attention he needs"".

I only noticed this a few hours ago and it really confuses me, like am I actually accepting that I'm depressed? 

Or Have I faked it so long that I believe it myself now?

I guess if it is the former I could call that progress? 

However If it's the latter I'm just running in circles and will end up in that repeating cycle of self-loathing mantras. 

So I have no idea if there is any point to my post (probably not) I just wanted to rant at how confused I am right now.

depression,"1. It’s okay to feel bad and to cry it all out. Take the time to let yourself feel the emotions instead of bottling them away. I might feel this way for awhile and I might want to cry for so long but I know one day I’ll wake up and it’ll be enough. I’ll be able to move on and be strong. 
2. Use the people who want to support you in life. This seems like such an easy one but for me I never brought up my issues to anyone because I didn’t want to be a bother to them. But I’ve seen how that just makes me drive people away because I get resentful and in my own mind, when in reality I’m the one not trying harder to communicate how I feel because it’s hard.
3. Things happen. All the cards can be played right but it still doesn’t pan out to what you want it to be. It absolutely sucks and I can’t do anything about it. I gave it my all for so long and it feels like I’ve been betrayed. But I know that life is weird and full of twists and turns and everyone gets lost for a bit, they just need time to find their way out of this maze, just like me.
4. It wasn’t your fault. It toke me so long (I still feel this way honestly I’m working on this more) to realize that everyone has their own perspective on the everts in their life and it doesn’t mean that you weren’t good enough, or attractive enough, or smart enough or whatever. It just means that life works in weird ways and it wasn’t meant to be. You can still grow and cherish these experiences, because they make you who you are now. 
5. Give the world some love. I didn’t know it but after I finally talked to my friends about issues I have, they all said I was a very special person to them and that I would do great things in life. I’ve never believed it myself, it’s so hard to want to believe in yourself when everything is falling apart. But I guess I still gave my authentic self to people I cared about and in turn they saw who I was as a person. Sometimes it’s just nice to be nice to strangers or friends. Maybe they need a little encouragement and in the end you both feel better for it.

I've lost 2 aunts (both of which I loved dearly) to cancer, 2 uncles (1 I loved like a father, one I didn't know very well) to cancer, one uncle to murder, (Culprit never caught), I lost my mother at 4 years old during surgery after a car accident, (Drunk driver. Never caught.) And my dad was in prison for the first 6 years of my life. He currently lives in a different state. We don't talk much. I live with my grandparents, and as much as I hate to say it, they're not doing too well. After my mother's death, my dad took time to cope. At this point he was still in prison.

I hate arguments. I hate drama. I hate stress. Most days I feel unbelievable guilt over stupid things, over people being childish and not understanding things. You tell me you love me. But how can you possibly tell me that? You don't know me. The things you think of me are the only things you want to believe, I'm the figure you hope to find in the future. Soon then you will realise but until then you want me to hurt over and over because of all of you loving me and then to tell me it's my fault. I never wanted any of this to happen. I never wanted to be at fault for anything, I just wanted to be happy. I wanted to have fun in quarantine and I wanted to try to smile for once in a while but all that happens is I seem to feel sadder and sadder each day. But no one understands, no one believes me, or I'm being dramatic. Probably all three of those things. But I can't keep pretending like this isn't hurting me, it isn't affecting me because it's all I think about. All I do is hurt people, and they blame me, then they don't. I deserve the pain, I deserve the hate, I deserve to be shouted at. Why is everything so easy for everyone else? The things I feel are over dumb shit that won't matter in a year so why do I feel all of this suddenly now? And why is it only me? It feels like whatever is making me feel like this all together is a mask, or a dark fog clouding over me. It's consuming me, but its nothing. I hear all these stories of people's lives, of all of your lives, and it is so much worse than I could possibly imagine. You are all strong people but I am not. I feel stupid to even be thinking like this, I don't deserve it when you have gone through so much worse. My pain is pathetic. I am pathetic. Why am I sad and stressed over such stupid things? Why do I overreact to everything? I wish I didn't care. I wish I was heartless. Some say that is the greatest personality trait but no it's not. It makes me feel guilty. Overwhelming guilt, it feels as if I've killed all of you, all your emotions are dying because of me, and because of everything, I do. My actions seem to be like murder to your mind. I'm sorry for hurting any of you emotionally. None of you deserved it, you all deserve someone who isn't like me. Someone who doesn't randomly feel like the world is against them. But I just feel like that's what I deserve. I don't deserve love, I don't deserve anything. Yet I complain about not having everything like money all the time too.

depression,"I’m 14 and I think I’ve developed bipolar depression. My dad has always been bipolar and he also verbally abused me a lot. Websites say that it can be caused by abuse, trauma, family genes, and stress. Recently I have been really stressed with school so that might be the cause along with my past. Soccer is my dream but now I feel I’ve lost all my feelings for it, I also lost my feelings to be successful and lost all my motivation. I feel trapped, like I’m such in a deep state I can’t get out.

my brain doesn't function properly anymore as brain fog has swallowed me whole. I cannot think worth a damn and I feel as though my mind and my body are disconnected entirely. I mentally black out as i say and do stupid shit only for my conscoiusness to snap back into place after the fact to live with the consequences. I feel like I'm making excuses and that's because I am, but thats truly how it feels day in and day out. particularly with my boyfriend.

my brain fog has frustrated him the most besides myself. I am in a constant state of zoned out and he constantly has to reel me back into reality to save me from shit as serious as crashing my car or as mundane as running into people on the sidewalk. I also constantly don't think before I open my fucking mouth and as a result say hurtful things when I'm mad at him or say just stupid shit in general and embarrass myself. 

it doesn't help that I have a massive guilt complex that stems from childhood. he has gotten more and more frustrated that I cry every time we argue, so he's stopped arguing and just let me approach him when i calm down. but I can't calm down because while he's on his computer mildly pissed at me I'm destroying myself in our bedroom mentally screaming about how much of a massive piece of self sabotaging shit I am and how much I hate myself and how I need to hurt myself because I don't deserve skin I don't deserve muscles I don't deserve anything because I keep making these dumb decisions and I'm terrified that I'm ruining his life and making him feel the way I feel. obviously I'm not and he doesn't but in the moment it feels that way.


all of this is amplified to be 100x worse with this fucking quarantine going on we've been fighting so much because I'm stressed out all the goddamn time with everything going on and I keep unintentionally taking it out on him because I have no one or nothing else to take it out on. its truly driving us apart and I'm so heartbroken and consumed with guilt.

Dear xxxx, 

I really wanted to help you. I'm not sure what exactly I'd help with, but I think the desire came from me wanting to turn you into the idealized version I had. I don't understand exactly what I had in mind, the only thing that makes sense to me is making you into someone who made me happy. This was selfish of me, I'm sorry for that. I know I have been difficult to deal with, I've made a lot of mistakes. I'd be distant everytime you dissapointed me. I can't blame you, you never promised me anything, it was all expectations I thought you'd accomplish.  Over the time I've spent getting to know you, I've discovered you're an internalized racist, annoyed when anyone other than you expresses discomfort in their life. You lack compassion, you don't try and help anyone unless it benefits you. I messed up, I regret meeting you. My life would be so much easier without you, I know it's a selfish thing to say, but frankly, you most likely feel the same way, and I understand. I know this sounds like it is meant to talk shit to you, maybe it is all this is, but man, you really make my life difficult. I don't know what to do, I don't like you, I wish you weren't in my life. In my eyes, you're pathetic. I hate seeing you, the fact that your only goal in life is to have a woman to fuck and to appear masculine is pathetic. You're not masculine, you're the prime example of a fucking waste of space. No amount of height and dick size will ever compensate for the worst personality. I'm not sure if I loved you, I might've, or I might've just been bored, lonely? I know, I myself am a shitty person and I've written multiple of these letters to myself, I'm not justifying the person I am. Even so, I still feel a need to write this to you. If I think about it, I did feel love towards you, I'm not sure why it was there in the first place. You didn't offer much to me, I can't say you even made me happier than I was. If anything you robbed me of any happiness and self respect I had. It was my mistake to get involved, I'm sorry for dragging you into my life. It's going to get a bit gross, but this is my letter, so whatever. Sometimes I feel like vomiting when I think of you. I think of the way you used to touch me and the awful kisses you gave me. Your tongue, it tasted awful, I just didn't know how to say it. To be honest, I'm pretty sure mine was probably bad too, I don't know, but you seemed so eager to taste it all the time, it's hard to say. I'm disgusted, I don't know why. I know people do that stuff all the time. I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to be intimate. I didn't want to share my body with anyone else. You groped me and I couldn't say no. You saw me naked and I couldnt say no. I don't think I'll ever get that back, the feeling of being in control. I said many things to please you, I asked for things I didn't want because I knew you wanted to give them to me. I can't believe I practically made my life purpose at the time to serve you, to make you happy, but even then I dont think it worked. I can't blame you, no, I don't blame you. I put this on myself, I just wish I never met you. Most of this is my fault. I approached you, I talked to you, maybe I was lonely, I just wanted to help you be a better person, I guess. I still dont know why. I'd like to take this as a learning experience, but what did I learn? I dont think I've gained anything positive from the experience we've gained together. I'm sorry, I really am. At night I pray to God that he forgive me. I know I messed up, meeting you, getting to know you. I pray he give me peace of mind, no more resentment. I don't hate you, xxxx, I just wish I never met you. You look up to these idols, these masculine figures, wishing you could be them, flaunting your looks, claiming to be handsome. No matter how you looked, you'd always repulse me. You're not like those guys. People look up to them. Nobody will look up to you, nobody will want to be you. Nobody wants to be you. You send me videos shirtless, with scrawny arms trying to deadlift, yet all you eat is junk, junk, and junk, and chug Monsters all day. It's pathetic, you excercise for the praise, you don't care about your body. You don't care about your health. Playing sports was never about being healthy, it was about the image. You wanted people to think of you a certain way, it's the only reason you bothered to play sports. I'm sorry you were made to feel that way, that people will only care about you if you can pass a ball around. You make me upset, I agree, this letter is very shitty and hateful, I just can't help myself, that's how you made me feel towards myself. You used me for my body, you claimed you loved me so you could use me as your status. I lost most of my friends because they couldn't believe I'd date someone like you. I thank you for that though, I figured theyre toxic friends anyways, but I should've seen it. People don't like you. I ignored them because I claimed I was in love. I dont know if I was in love, all the emotions I have towards you are ruined. I will never be able to comprehend them. I can't sleep at night because of you. I don't want to wake up every 2 hours because I see you in my dreams. It's been more than 2 months since I've seen you and it's still hard to deal with just the idea of you.

depression,"I think my mental health started declining during 5th grade. I had one friend in my class, but she was almost never in school. I was always alone during the brakes, even though I was asked to go play with some other kids a few times. I didn’t have the courage to play with any of my classmates. I was constantly picking my nails cause I was always nervous and stressed. I was so lonely all the time. My grades were shit. I never really did any homework or anything. I felt like shit, but I never told my parents. I lied to them about having friends and being happy.

During 6th grade I had a few more friends which made it a better year. I had people I could talk to. The problem in 6th grade though, was that I had gained A LOT of weight, and I hated how I looked. I got glasses that year too, which didn’t really make anything better. My grades were slightly better, but still bad. I rarely studied, and I almost failed math class. I had no motivation during this time, and I even talked to my mentor about it. Or maybe she talked to me (I think so). I didn’t have any confidence, and I really hated how I looked during 6th grade.

7th grade started out good, I had a lot of friends which made me like school a bit more. I had started to lose some weight, since I was fat. This then quickly turned into an ED and all I thought about was food and exercise. I don’t really know why it went like this, I guess it was because some stuff went wrong before this. 

There was a guy who I had a crush on during the summer (we both kinda liked each other, but it never became a thing). One night my friend told me she apparently liked him too now. This made me have a panic attack in my room (then bathroom floor) at 2 am, cause I still wasn’t over him even though I told her I was :) 

Another one of my friends also found out she had a tumor in her leg, but it wasn’t dangerous. It still scared me a bit though. 

Anyways, I went to a ward (I don’t really know what to call it) for my ED in the end of February, and I missed the last term of school. It really lowered my grades, and I felt so worthless. I had gotten decent grades during the first term, and school was actually going okay for the first time ever. But that didn’t really work out.

Last year I started 8th grade. I had one friend in the beginning, and then made 2 new. One of them ended up switching schools though, so that was kinda sad. Everything was going okay, but I was a bit behind in school. I still did okay though (trying to be positive). My mental health started declining again during the winter though. I was having suicidal thoughts almost every day, and I felt so fucking worthless (still kinda do if I’m being honest). 

It went away when the spring arrived, but that was when my obsessive and compulsive behavior began to escalate. I’ve had it (but only mildly) during every winter since 4th grade, and it’s gotten progressively worse each year. This year it kinda escalated, and I can’t really stop now. But, I’m seeing a psychologist in June, so I hope I can start taking medication. 

TL;DR:
Anyways, I’ve never had any motivation to do anything in school during these years. I’ve never been the one to start a conversation with anyone, I haven’t had the motivation to do it. I don’t see a purpose in doing anything, and it’s been like this for years. Why should I sleep if I don’t feel like there’s a reason to wake up for school? Why should I study if I’m just going to disappear one day?

depression,"I've always been insecure about my looks, especially my the shape of my nose. The anterior angle of my nose is an instant downward slope, and this is accompanied by a deviated septum and sometimes a physically painful feeling in my nose which just makes the whole ordeal all the more painful, emotionally and physical, also I sometimes have trouble breathing sometimes through my nose, oh and did I also mention that I have Chronic Rhinitis (Nasal Discharge) that makes it crippling for me to exist in social situations without looking stupid.

All of this is very overwhelming, it's been a let down for me in the past but recently it has gotten more to me and it absolutely just makes me wanna put a bullet in my brain for good.

The confusing and painful thing is I've never seen anyone with my nose profile ever, which probably explains why I feel like an alien all the time, like I don't belong. Maybe if I had an ugly nose that someone out there in the world had I would feel a little better that I'm not alone, but no I had to have been born with the most unique and ugly nose. (I don't have the biggest nose in the world it's kinda medium sized but still ugly looking).

I'd say I def have Body Dysmorphia, but if I remember correctly BDD is only for people who think that they're ugly when they're NOT.

And the thing is as well when I smile (the most humane thing a person can do that costs literally nothing), my nose takes a very ugly (more so than it is) shape because it moves down with my mouth as there is no support from the anterior angle.

Even the least good-looking person out there probably has a normal looking nose, unlike me.

Surgery or septoplasty are definitely out of the question as I literally have no money and it's very expensive where I live especially, and since my parents divorced from a very long and miserable marriage and I live with my mother, it's become even more out of the question (also I should mention that my father doesn't pay for our expenses anymore as well, and my mother is a stay-at-home).

I never had friends, never had any meaningful relationship or connection with anyone ever growing up, might have been of my ugliness or maybe it was my social anxiety or was it the lack of energy to make friends? Who knows..

I have been crying to sleep every night, I cry a lot even during the day and I'm just so so tired from this life and I wanna finally get a relief.

It all started mainly when my parents were struggling with addiction back and forth and I was the one to finally step up and do something about it. Long story short I struggled with that for a couple years but now everything has calmed down and went somewhat back to normal. Lately, this has what made me realize I don't feel ""normal"".

Because of this, I think they've cared less about how I feel or maybe they think I am a strong person when in fact I have a vulnerable side wanting my life to end. 

Today, my family was in the livingroom watching TV. I went downstairs to get something. My mom's a neat freak and we're required to wear slippers downstairs. As I was on the last step, I had to extend my legs to reach my slippers but they were too far so my feet touched the ground.

depression,"Even though I keep my life in pretty good order, I eat healthy, I sleep regular, I have a job, take classes, have goals, have hobbies... I'm cynical about life. 

I dont have a religion and so i know life only has the meaning you give to it, but I cant give it any meaning that makes me happy. If I try living in the moment, every, single, fucking, time, I WILL fall back on old habits. I will stop taking care of myself, I will eat poorly, experiment with drugs, break things out of anger. 

I cant indulge any hedonistic pleasure because it just puts me on the path of self destruction. In other people's eyes I'm doing great right now. Like I said, i have my shit together, and i can use my willpower (though it takes all of it) to just keep marching forward but nothing in my goals makes me happy. 

Music used to make me happy, i was even a music major for a while. I still practice but feel nothing, I listen to my old favorites and explore for new stuff and it just all starts to sound the same. 

Never had sex or a girlfriend but every girl I meet is a psycho and manipulative or so needy that shes not worth my time. Sex doesnt seem any more enticing than masturbation, which I also limit and RARELY do with the help of pornography - once again I will become addicted and have quit. 

It doesnt matter that I can take care of myself and be a ""healthy person"". Life has no meaning and I dont enjoy it. It's a bother to socialize with people and listen to their problems but i do it, and i offer help and follow through. People help me and it honestly only makes me feel guilt because I know they must deeply care about me but I just force myself to because I dont want to fall into a recluse state. 

The only times I feel happy are when I say fuck it and go drink a 15 pack of beer and chain smoke cigarettes. This will put me on a few week long downward spiral where I start to lose grip of things, then I have to reschedule my shit and resummon my willpower. And in the end was it worth it? Just to get fucked up and make a fool of myself. 

It feels like it is worth it though when I look at my potential future and cant visualize anything that would satisfy me. Not even if I could fly or shoot lazer beams from my fingertips would I feel happy. No girl could ever satisfy me, no friendship could distract me from our inevitable demise.

Heart-wrenching grief, soul-searing pain ripping at the very seams of my being, solitary confinement with rules that cannot be bent.

Not going to say my exact age, but high teens. Female. 

So I have been struggling with mental health for as long as I can remember, but it really started about a year ago. 

Some backstory and explanation so things make sense:

My father passes in 2015, therefore I lived with my sister and mom. I took the death in a negative way, and spent my time alone and got really depressed. Then I started to get trust issues with my family cause they were taking it so well and I wasn't (was pretty selfish of me). Therefore, I wouldn't really talk to my family. In about 2018, I stopped talking to them all together, and I would only vent/ talk about my emotions and how I was feeling to my close friends. I started doing that for about a year. In about 2017, my mom got a boyfriend. Me and my sister were forced to go their place every night; and lets just say that we don't get along too well. Well, in about the mid 2017, I wasn't feeling great mentally, and I stayed in bed for about an extra hour and a half. They tried to get me out of bed to look at a fox, but I refused, and apparently that was disrespectful. I told my mom's boyfriend that I was feeling extra depressed that day, but he kicked me out for a while. I was ""just being lazy"", and ""looking for attention"". To this day, I don't think he believes in mental illnesses. After I moved the the boyfriend's house, my mom and boyfriend get their own place, me and me sister got our own place. Both on the same property. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where things start to get wild: 

After staying at my mom's place after I was kicked out, despite my protests I was forced to go back to my mom's boyfriend's place because it turns out that we were moving there. Oh, boy. It was going generally fine, as I was mostly avoiding him, but after he shot the family dog for running away, I kinda cracked. I really shouldn't have as I knew what would come of it. I still feel shitty about this but I still think I did the right thing here. I tried to tell them that what they did was wrong, and that it really scared me. Then I got real pissed and shut myself in my room for a few days. Remember how I would only ever talk to me friends about my emotions? Well I did that. That's something that I truly regret, and is probably the reason why I've tried to kill myself so many times. Here's why. 

My mom's boyfriend took my phone during that protest, cause I stupidly left it lying around. After looking through it, he found my support group chat and read everything. I was dragged into an angry confrontation. There's a lot that happened, but here is the basic rundown. 

In about an hour into it, I think I started developing selective mutism. This means that whenever I'm really anxious, I freeze and I am physically unable to speak. 

I was told I was an attention whore. That I only keep my friends by ""making up stories"" to make them pity me. That I'm malicious, abusive, and and psychopath. 

Was told that the only thing I will ever succeed in will be lying to the people I love. 

And that anything other than the truth is unacceptable, and I would have to tell them about everything I am feeling. 

So, I did just that. I told them that I was suicidal. And I told them why. BIGGEST MISTAKE. 

I was thrown out of the house to word ""abusive"" being yelled over and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I was watching everyone else on the property have fun and grow bonds while I couldn't leave my house. This continued until I left for 6 weeks for cadet camp (summer of 2018). I came back, and was devastated at what I came back too. I come back, and no one even looks at me. Not even my sister. I say hi, and it goes ignored. I have been gone for a month and a half and this is what I come back to? I work my ass off doing an advanced course with the military and this is my congratulations? I get a medal for being the top cadet and I don't even get recognized my my own damn family? This broke me a little bit. 

So I was alone in my room for the rest of my summer. With half of the stuff I own going missing while I was gone, It went by slowly. 

After that, about once a week someone would try to talk to me. But I couldn't talk. That select mutism wouldn't let me. And I couldn't tell them that I even had this because I couldn't physically. Each time they talked to me, I was scared that something worse would happen to me, and I couldn't see them without my anxiety rocketing. In January this year they started threatening me because I wouldn't say anything. I started at simple punishments but have escalated to being threatened of being thrown out, the things I use for coping being thrown in our wood stove, and my contact with my friends being severed. 

Today was probably one of the last times I am going to be confronted. All of my communication with anyone not on my property has been cut off. I haven't vented to anyone since that initial talk about it. Tomorrow, wifi is going to be turned off and I won't be able to talk to anyone. I've tried to kill myself multiple times, but I think this is where it ends. I won't be able to stop myself this time. Today's talk really hit me hard this time. 

If I'm going to go out, I at least want other people to know what I went through and why emotional abuse is not a joke. Parents, if you see your child with signs of severe anxiety, depression, or mental illness(s), please help them. Emotional abuse will probably end my life. Stay safe out there. &lt;3

depression,"This thing started during the day of my entrance exam of collage. I've worked my ass off for 2 years without doing any so called entertainment. Stopped watching tv stopped taking about baseless things to my friends for hours stopped internet and started using feature phone . I've only studied my day was a routine of going to school or coching or to study . Now on the day after I've given the exam and I seen the answer key I knew that I wasn't going to get into my dream college league but just an ok collage.
Now at that time I started crying and tearing my notes etc.. I felt like it was the end of the world and my life was going to be finished.
My parents got scared of thinking of me doing something bad to myself (that's what I think) so the called my cousin who is like the best version of a person who I greatly respect and want to be like him who was studying in the type of college I want to be in but can't.
He bring me to his hostel room and we ate some food but not talked about the exams or anything related to it.

Now my parents enrolled me to that ""ok collage"" which I don't like but is a decent college which many are not eligible to go. 
Now the main problem starts that I've been admitted to the college I don't like but is admitted to so after seeing the lax environment there I started to fell like I deed to give myself a break so I dug deep into anime tv series and such similar stuff but now my job placement time is coming closer and I want to stop wasting a huge part of my day reading webnovels.

&amp;#x200B;

Pandemic aside, my world is getting so small. My entire life is made up of playing the same 10 or so video games, and listening to the same 5 bands over and over and over again. The only thing in my life that has not become disappointing as I age is eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's getting worse too. Now not only am I restricted to these games and artists, but I'm becoming more seasonal as I get older, so now I can only play certain things at certain times of the year. I'm stuck on a certain game series because it's the ""right"" time of year to play it. I'm desperate to move on, but playing anything else right now would feel wrong and cause me to go dissociative. Same with music, I can only listen to one band right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't discover anything new. I try, but I've just developed this revulsion to new things, and I'm becoming this cynical, bitter person that I despise. I'll try to go and discover some new music, but I'll end up stuck listening to a different band I've maybe not listened to in a while, but have already played to death anyway. I also just seem to hate all new games. I'm trying so hard to not go full lewronggeneration, but modern games just don't give me that sense of childlike wonder and awe that I used to get from games all the time, as recently as 5 or 6 years ago. So now I'm just beating the corpses of the same few games over and over and over again until I hate them too.

&amp;#x200B;

The past many years seem to be based on a particular pattern I had for about 2 or 3 years, when I was basically a full NEET. I was a borderline alcoholic, I cried constantly, and I felt sick and miserable all the time. Back then, my days consisted solely of playing whatever games I liked that came to mind, waiting for my parents to go to bed before going downstairs and watching TV for a while before going to bed and waking up late afternoon. The result was, I basically played this kind of rotation of games and music, the same 5-10 throughout those couple years - and every year since has been based on those few terrible years.

depression,"I'm 21 (F) and I've been struggling with mental illness for 6 years now. I've been in and out of hospitals (I've been inpatient twice and partially hospitalized twice) and have tried so many medications, a lot with bad side effects (seizures, complete lack of appetite to the point where I developed an eating disorder, hallucinations, etc.). Still haven't found a med that really works for me, except for Adderall which helps sometimes.

No one's ever been able to quite figure out what I have diagnosis-wise, I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I definitely have that, but other than that it's been suggested to me that I have type II bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, OCD, complex PTSD, etc. My present therapist has me down for bipolar, which seems to fit but as a lot of you guys know, isn't set in stone. I know that diagnoses are nebulous and the definitions blend together a lot of the time, especially when ADHD is involved, but I really wish I had a label w/ which to name this thing is I'm dealing with.

Anyway, I just graduated from college, and I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I've been so bad motivation-wise bc I've been so depressed. I've literally only applied to one job in the last two weeks and every time I try to apply for something I just can't. I think a big part of it is that I really didn't think I'd make it to graduating college alive, and there's a big part of me that just can't handle this level of sickness anymore. If my depressive periods keep coming back and I have to keep suffering through them, is there a reason to keep living? I feel so messed up at this point that it feels like I'm just putting myself and my family through more pain. 

Two days ago I took the entire bottle of my anti-anxiety medication in one go in the hope that maybe I'd be sent to the hospital or something (I wasn't really thinking, just wanted the pain to stop). Nothing happened, literally just felt a little drifty for the rest of the night. I have a big stored-up pile of meds from failed medications that I tried, don't know exactly what they'll do but I think they would do the job good enough. 

I'm just so tired of the pain. Every day existing on just feels like a mighty labor, like I'm Sisyphus pushing my boulder up a hill just for it to roll down and for me to start again.

When I was 14 I became suicidal and tried to commit suicide several times, my worst attempt was when I was 18, which was a turning point and started a journey of healing, failure falling back into depression, getting back in tracks, getting my life together, failing again etc... It took me 12 years to learn to like myself and three more to live the life I always wanted. I am finally genuinely happy. 
I went trough this without therapie and without guidance or someone who understood.

A year ago he and his girlfriend of 10years broke up. And it hit him real hard. Since then we saw each other pretty often. He and my husband are on good terms, so he comes for dinner almost weekly and our relationship improved aswell. 

Yesterday he told me, He got depressions. I knew it since before Christmas. I knew it because I saw the signs I am way too familiar with. That's why I made sure to call him once a week to come for dinner. I didn't want to talk to him about it before he was comfortable to talk to me first. 
I really want to support him, I don't want him to go through the same like I did and I don't want him to feel, how I felt.

depression,"This might be a little long, if you read: cool, if you don't: cool. (No TL;DR) Also this post isn't a joke of any kind, I'm being pretty serious just FYI

It's somewhat strange exactly what I'm addicted to and I'm not even sure how common the addiction is. So I'm writing it out here to just type something out/use this as journal, work out what I'm going through by writing it down and see if anybody else is going through the same thing

So: I'm addicted to feeling depressed. More specifically heartbreak. It's a little complicated, but I'll try to simplify with a little backstory.

So cliche, but I've always been rejected when it comes to romantic relationships/are always unrequited. I've never been in a relationship because of it and I keep getting more cynical each time I realize I have a new crush. I immediately shut my feelings down and wait it out until said feelings are gone. Not a healthy way to do it, but it's effective, keeps me guarded and keeps the bar low. Anyways, romance and unrequited love turns out to be my favorite genre(s) when reading webcomics/manga or watch movies, etc. I never realized that I absolutely revel in the romantic endeavors in each story like that. When the fictional relationship goes well, I feel sad and think ""that'll never happen to me"" and get heartbroken. And when they go sour or they have unresolved/unrequited feeling for a person in story, I think ""I know how you feel"" and get heartbroken all the same (Just for clarification however, when heartbreak is happening to me in real life for a real crush, etc, I don't revel in it. I know, complicated blah blah) 

The thing is, though, I never realized that I had always been practically *actively* searching for things to read/watch that give me that feeling of heartbreak and keeping myself in that kind of state deliberately. It's almost like I feel as though I don't deserve that kind of happiness  one gets from romantic relationships. I love my friends and family and they love me, those relationships I have there are solid and good, but romance is a different category.

Tiny story within the story that kind of relates: I *almost* got into a romantic relationship with someone. I told them how I felt because my roommate was egging me on and encouraging me. They said they felt the same and the relationship felt like it was about to start, which was a *great* feeling. I could feel the doors finally opening to let me in, it was going to be my first ever relationship! But then I felt the *strongest* gut feeling I've *ever* felt in my life: ""This is wrong."" My head and heart kept *screaming* this at me *the* moment the relationship was established. It was so weird! At that moment, once I felt the gut feeling, it took over my entire body and mind. *Any* attraction/feelings I had felt for this person seconds before were *immediately* diminished, and I mean immediately. They were just gone, and the gut feeling had taken over everything that was left. ""This is wrong"" ""This isn't right"" ""You have to get out of this now"" It's like my fight or flight switch had been jammed to flight and was stuck for some reason. Unfortunately, I knew I couldn't lead this person on and I knew it would hurt me even more if I continued, so after only a day and a half I called it off. (It was mutual, so don't worry) Straight after calling it off, I relaxed so heavily. I didn't even feel any heartbreak, just relief, like I had been carrying a five year long weight on my shoulders for just that short amount of time. I have *no idea* what happened and why I felt that way during that time, and so extremely at that. Can anyone help me determine what that might have been?

Anyways, back to being addicted to heartbreak, Once this new year started, I realized that I have to be better to myself, and I had been doing okay until quarantine/covid. Begin stuck in isolation isn't anything new to me, that'a practically how I live my life on the daily! But something about being isolated by government mandate and bound by the fear that you or your loved ones could die does something to a person and makes every day hard, especially for someone who's already most likely got an anxiety disorder that they should probably get professional help for. 

Being stuck in quarantine made me finally realize that some of my problems were stemming from my addiction, especially health related problems like my memory and focus. Recently, my memory's been pretty shit and it's scaring me. And also my focus has shifted from being super aware to my surroundings and being able to multitask like nobody's business, to having to focus on what people are saying one at a time. When I'm reading something for example, someone could be talking straight in my ear, and I subconsciously tune them out so that I can't even hear them. I always have to backtrack and ask people to repeat themselves now, it's also scaring me.

Once I finally got it through my head that something was wrong with the way I ""like"" being heartbroken, I researched a little bit and found that depression can affect your memory. I also found that several hormones released when someone is heartbroken can be pretty damaging to their heart, especially when those chemicals are released frequently (which they shouldn't be), like it's been for me (which is another thing I've been having slight issues with)

So, I had a quiet and quick intervention with myself and decided to go the route as if I had a smoking habit: to go cold turkey. Since it was affecting my physical and mental health so drastically, it was time to change something, and since 2020 was the year that I was going to change my mental health around, why not still make a baby step with something somewhat manageable while stuck? And so far, I've been doing pretty good on that aspect! I haven't been thinking too hard about my love-life anymore (still have the cynical outlook on it however, never gonna find love, blah blah). I know I don't *need* to have a romantic relationship with anybody, but they are envious sometimes. And I haven't been actively searching for stories to bring me down! Actually...confession. I've had this post in my drafts for a few weeks, coming back when I felt like it to keep adding more, and just now before coming to finish up this post I almost gave into my urge to read something to make me feel heartbroken. 

I finished a show today that had two main characters get together happily, and I felt the familiar feeling. It stuck around and made me a little depressed, and once I was finally in my room alone from the day, I started looking up stories.

With my addiction I know I'm holding myself back and keeping myself from growing by keeping myself in this state with these feelings, but it's also that I've been in this state so long that the feeling of heartbreak is so comfortable and easy to be in that I just slip back in without realizing what's happening. I'm going to try harder to keep myself from destroying me any further. I have many things to work on, but this is significant to me and I ~~hope~~ know I can better myself.

depression,"This life is absolute horse-shit. No matter how much I achieve for myself, my friends, my family, and everyone, they will always find a way to ABSOLUTELY FUCK ME OVER FOR SOME GODDAMN REASON. I'm almost at my limit. 

I built myself up since I was a child since because my father is an asshole and hasn't taught me anything about life. I grew up making my own set of morals (which is to be nice to people who are nice to everyone or something like that).

All of my ""friends"" are apparently jealous of my achievements in school even though I didn't think that much of it. I never bragged about it. I always kept lowkey. The only ones bragging about it was my family with their unnecessary pride in MY achievements. They always leave me out when they hangout. I'm always the one left out. I'm the one taking all the blame for being ""sMaRt"". I'm not even that smart. I was just trying to please my mother. Everyone has high expectations of me always, and it's very heavy and crushing.

I stuck with computer games since I had felt safe playing it. It was my coping mechanism. But even that was taken away from me as a child by my family. They always said I have to study more or play with my friends. I can't play with my friends. They all hate me. I'm always studying by my own. I just wanted something to make me feel happy and safe albeit how small it was. Is it that wrong to want to do something that makes you happy? 

Because of it all, I started to skip classes, started drinking, smoking, hanging out with the wrong people. Call me weak if you want. I didn't have much of a choice back then. I believed that they understood me. In reality, they just wanted my money. After I realized that, I got even more depressed. 

I started to resort to dating as another coping mechanism. But I didn't have a nice body. So I often got rejected at that time. And if they did go out with me, the relationship was short lived. 

My grades finally dropped like hell. I almost repeated a couple grades. I didn't know anymore. Everyone was saying that they were disappointed in what I become. I didn't give a f***. Deep down inside, I was glad they were disappointed. 

I decided that I would change myself for the better. I quit all my vices and started working out. I think I did well, but people still point out the time I fucked up. I didn't know what to do back then. I'm tired of everybody I know. My asshole father always says ""if you're so smart then why are you a fuck up during highschool?"". He didn't even graduate himself. Meanwhile I always hear rumors about me from other people. 

How much more do I have to do? Do I have to have a lean-ass body before I get respected? Do I have to achieve more so everybody in my snob-ass family won't hate me? I'm just tired of trying. 

I had a dream as a kid. I always though things would work out for me if I tried enough. My efforts didn't mean jackshit. Maybe I just have shitty luck and was meant to sad.

depression,"Ive been very on and off about music in the past. I honestly only listen to a select few songs for a few minutes at a time when Im having manic episodes of euphoria. But I cancelled my Spotify account last year. 

First I dropped hip hop. All the trap / rap I was blaring didnt have any meaning to me. All I hear whenever I listen to those songs anymore are a bunch of millionaires bragging about all the dollars they stack or all the beautiful women they fuck. 

After a while if paying attention to the lyrics, I realize that I didn’t relate to any of the themes. Many songs I actually enjoyed but for the most part it felt like I was only bumping that stuff in order to appear up to date with pop culture. 

Then I realized I dont relate to or particularly enjoy songs of any other genre.  Fame, Wealth, Success, Love — all themes that I dont relate to or even understand. So none of the lyrics of practically any mainstream song hit home. 

In fact I actually get depressed when I hear songs being played about those things (and pretty much all music is about that stuff now). Just walking through a grocery aisle is hard for me sometimes because of all the upbeat music playing in the store. It makes me reminisce about important moments in my life that could have been beautiful and cherished memories but instead ended up being less than I had hoped. It makes me think about how undesirable I am and how much happier everyone else who can relate to those themes is. 

Same thing with movies. All I see are Hollywood tropes, cheesy acting, corny storytelling, and very often themes about love and empathy that I cant relate to. Nothing is truly captivating to me anymore. I feel hollow and unmoved by a lot of works made by other people.

Decided to get out of my shell and start dating as a late bloomer (I'm 25M btw). Got ghosted by a few women on tinder before the first date, but I was alright and moved on. Then late January came and dated a cool chick for about a month but then she ghosted me out of the blue. It hurt for about a week but I started to realize we weren't as compatible anyway. Another month goes by and I finally match with another chick on Tinder. This one felt more my speed. We had the same sense of humor, she was smart and about to finish school and we were the both same kind of weird that liked math. Our dates were great and the chemistry was everything I ever wanted out of life. With her I felt happy and forgot all about my depression and anxiety. I was the person I wanted to be with her. Then our state went on lockdown and she had to return home. We texted everyday from day to night for the next 2 months and we even admitted how much we missed each other. I missed seeing that beautiful smile of hers, I missed how she used to mess words up, her touch and how she'd look at me. We texted non-stop until about a week ago and out of nowhere she blocked and ghosted me......saw her new profile on Tinder too :/

I honestly just want to kill myself because I've never made close friends, went to parties, played sports... I did absolutely nothing in the time I was in high school.

Like I can’t even get rid of picture frames that were hers, books she’s given me or blankets, candles she got me or even a wooden tray for food, or a computer that she bought me and I never even use it... it’s even hard for me to think about getting rid of the stuff I got myself like a tv console or my bed frame.

It feels more boring than scary. You just wake up in the underworld and you don’t know when you are going to be able to get out. Your critical mind tells you that it will be temporary, but another part of you is convinced that the underworld is reality and that is how is going to be forever. Not only that, is even convinced that your whole past has happened in that underwhelming boring and gloomy reality.

Then one day, you wake up and you don’t feel that anymore. And it’s even difficult to recall the feeling of doom and gloom you felt in the underworld. You are ok now, but you also know you’ll pass to the other side again sooner or later.

A few days ago it was a year ago that I tried to kill myself. Thankfully I failed. I've only told 3 people about what happened. My mama found me but thankfully I don't think she quite realised what my intentions where. It's also been 2 months since I stopped doing cocaine. It was kinda imposed by the whole global pandemic/lockdown situation but hey, I'm not complaining. Whilst I certainly wasn't a rampaging drug addict or living some next Requiem For A Dream lifestyle, it was getting a little out of hand again. 

Anyways the reason im making this post is because I still feel fucked up. A few days ago the voice inside my head started telling me I should kill myself. I started seeing how I would do it. It gave me no fucking peace. My life is generally wonderful. I'm fighting this shit. At the start of lockdown I could barely do 10 press ups, now I can do 75 in a row. I'm exercising daily. I've had a real creative hot streak several times these last 2 months. I've cut my drinking from a lot everyday to maybe a beer or two a day. I'm somehow financial in the best position of my life. I have friends and family who love me and I love them. I fucking love my dog man, I don't want to die. 

But, I'm still in pain... I slipped down the stairs earlier and I bashed my knee and it hurt for a bit. I guess that's what sparked this post. I could feel that pain, it felt acceptable. I could identify what was hurting and why. This is different tho. I don't think I'm depressed. Two winters ago, I was heavily depressed. Maybe the worst hole I've ever been in. I couldn't get out of bed for months. I shut down completely. I fought my way out of it and just as everything was sunny I tried to kill myself, over nothing and pretty much out of nowhere.

That's how I've been feeling again with these fucking voices in my head man. I'm tired all the time. I'm tired of having this goldmine of a life but having this raincloud follow me around everywhere.

I lost my job with decent insurance last August, and the first things to go were my therapist and psychiatrist. I simply cannot afford $100+ per session when I'm not working. But for a while, I was able to make it work by practicing techniques they taught me and going to certain friends, with their consent, when things got too bad. But my friends have seemed less and less interested in helping me as time has gone on. 

I'm pretty heavily introverted, but despite that, I had a decent amount of friends. I had 7 people that I could semi-reliably rely on.

I always respected boundaries, I would ask if they were in a good enough head space to handle talking to me, and if they said no, I never tried to guilt trip them over it. But then 2 of them moved out of city; one about 3 hours away, the other halfway across the country. 1 has never been too great at this sort of thing because her brother killed himself when she was a teen, and I always respected that. 1 seemingly disappeared after some really personal issues involving two women and two children.
Another 1 was one of the two women I just mentioned, and she kind of blames me for introducing her to that friend. 1 got a new boyfriend, who didn't like that sometimes my texts would upset her, and he threatened to kick my ass if it happened again. And the last 1 is my wife, who's been my rock for many years, as I've tried to be hers. But last night, I told her about how I was feeling, and she sighed. It was that kind of exasperated sigh, similar to the one you give when you see your dog making a mess on the carpet again.

My family is no help. Mom's approach is to lecture me on how good I've had it compared to other people, and Dad's basically a bolder with glasses. His Dad was never emotionally available for him, so he never learned to be emotionally available for me and my brothers. My younger brother is working in another state, and I had a bad experience with my older brother that involved a lot of whiskey and a rifle, so we don't talk much.

I've had bad experiences with hotlines and text lines. I've been put on hold more than once, and the one time I tried a text line, they called a wellness check on me using information I didn't give them.

depression,"I feel so sad right now. I just don’t know what to do w myself. So many things are bothering me rn and I j don’t know how to function. Below is a list of shit that’s on my mind:

My gf texted me today and told me her mom has scabies, and that I can’t come visit her again until I get tested for scabies since I was w her a couple weeks ago, that way her family doesn’t get it again. It’s such a huge inconvenience since doctors offices are packed rn bc of covid. Plus, my anxiety ridden father is gonna freak out and get onto me for being around someone w scabies, as if I could help that.

Its the weekend so my parents will be home for the next 2 days, which also means that they’re gonna drink tonight. They’re such a horrible influence on my mental health and I hate being around them, especially when there’s alcohol involved. They’re also obnoxiously loud until the early morning, and make it so hard to sleep/feel at peace.

My engagement ring came in the mail today. It’s too small, so I have to get it resized, which is a huge pain in the ass, since there’s no jewelers open rn bc of covid.

I also have to pick up my brother from work tonight at 11. His dumbass still can’t drive, and makes no effort to learn. I’m so tired of driving him around, especially since he’s 22 years old.

At the same time, I have to take my aunt home tonight, since she’s coming over to drink w my parents and can’t drive home.

I also miss my gf like hell. She’s 31 weeks pregnant and I hardly get to see her bc we live 2 hours away from each other. I won’t get to see her again until 2 weeks from now.

I’ve been working a lot lately to save up money for an apartment. It’s so exhausting, working 40 hours a week at a grocery store. It’s so taxing on my body, especially since I have to wake up at 4 AM 3 times a week. And it’s such manual labor, my back and legs are often on fire. I’m always so tired, plus I have to fight for my hours bc they’d rather give the hours to new employees than me, who’s worked there for almost 5 years.

Since I’m saving my money, I can hardly spend on anything I want. I’ve been wanting to play doom eternal for a while now, but i can’t just shell out $60. So I’ve been trying to learn how to speedrun one of my fav games, dark souls, but that’s really all I have to do.

I’ve had very little hobbies lately. Everything is so boring, and I get little joy from anything nowadays that doesn’t concern my gf. She’s the only one that makes me feel anything. I tried to go camping w my friend the other day, and all I did was eat, drink, and stare at a campfire until I fell asleep.

I’m also rly tired of hearing about the riots from my family, especially my dad. He’s super racist, and sometimes I wonder if he was waiting for BLM to do something just so he can complain about how much he hates black ppl. Additionally, he’s always making everyone feel miserable constantly because he’s controlling, manipulative, micromanaging, obnoxious, disgusting, and mean. 

My family hasn’t been supporting me through my gf’s pregnancy either, which makes things all the more difficult. Every second my daughter, gf, or marriage gets brought up, I get lectured.

depression,"Extremely lost post, so sorry about that, tldr at the end. Sorry in advance if there are grammar mistakes. English is not my main language. Thanks in advance for reading. 

I am a 26 year old woman who has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression last year. Who at the moment lives sorta with her boyfriend in his student home (one room where you eat, live, sleep and cook, the shower and toilet is shared with 13 other students). I have a student home myself, but I do not feel at home anymore there, My room is even smaller than his, and my housemate that lives underneath me has a girlfriend whom he likes to have sex with extremely loud. I already tried saying anything about it but my ptsd gives me flashbacks and I remember saying to my brother to walk the dog and he just beat me up till I bled because I asked. This happened multiple times with my brother, my mom and her boyfriend. Im afraid to even ask the simplest things of adult males due to this.
I also cannot really be alone for to long or I lose myself and stop taking care of myself. But I have to get back to my student home pretty soon, otherwise my SO will lose his home due to the fact im continuously with him and as soon as they think we live together (what we are indeed doing for my own sake), he will get kicked out of his own home. 

This all escalated when corona virus hit. I still had a job mid March (this was in a shop where we sell tabacco products and lottery tickets). Untill I got symptoms and I asked my boss if it was okay for me to stay home to protect my boss (above 65 years) and all of the regulars (who are mostly also above 65 years). She did not take me seriously. She thought I was bluffing. So her idea was to stop my contract just till I was better. When I felt better they would just activate my contract again.

Well jokes on you, fast forward 4 days. The symptoms got less and I felt good enough to work. I called my boss and she just blunty told me she wasnt going to activate my contract anymore, since not a lot of people come to the shop at the moment. She decided to close her shop till she could open up again.

That was a lie. My parents live close by my job and they told me the shop was still open. I tried asking her for reason but she kept ignoring me all the time.

So she told me to ""just"" get a settlement payment, I was entiteled to get it anyway, due to corona. Fun part, this was in march and I am currently still fighting for my settlement payment, so that I can pay my rent and bills.

I will try to explain it in english, its the dutch goverment I will try to explain.
So you basically have WWpayment and Assistance payment. WW is the one mostly people are entitled for when they lose their job. Assistance payment is when you have no right on any settlement payment, so that's basically the last option anyone has.

I ofcourse went for WWpayment since I thought I had the right for it. Turns out, because I switched jobes last December, I do not have the right for WWpayment. I worked at the shop for 12 weeks. You need to work at least 16 weeks to have the right for a WWpayment. So I went and try to get assistance payment. I had to wait a full month before it was my turn to try and get it. When they blunty told me that I had every right for a WWpayment and hence this whole roller-coaster began. They both had said no.

I was rejected because the job I had before my last one (its one where I worked more than 16 weeks so its normal the goverment starts looking at the most recent job that can give me the right for WWpayment) I quit on my own accord and its a very strict rule with WWpayment that you have no right if you quit yourself, because that way you make yourself jobless, hence no right. BUT. 1 week before my last day at that job, I had already signed a contract with my last job, hence I was never jobless and made sure I had an income. I changed jobs because the job I worked at (kinda like wallmart I guess) was asking so much of me mentally and my therapist told me that it could help if I went and got a job that would be more at ease for my mentally state and thats why I switched. I told this to the agent (the one that takes care of my objection) and he simple told me that he could not use that since my therapist did not really ""force"" me to stop, she just suggested it. 

They told me to submit an objection against the decision of the WWpayment. An other fun thing, the end decision of my objection could take till September.
So today I sent an email because it has been 2 weeks since my last contact with the status of my objection and the agent that has me as his client called me back right away, which in a positive way was very done. But he told me that it would be extremely difficult to get me a situation where I have the right for WWpayment. But he will try to get a decision out by next friday.

I am so afraid that when I go back home, I will lose myself. I have had issues with money in the past (my nmom would not help me when I was 17 and full of debt because I could not find a job at that time) and it made me make decisions like stop buying food, just so I could pay a little bit of the bills to keep the debt collecters away. I am extremely afraid I will do it again and stop eating because bills are more important and I will never want to go back to when I had debt collectors on my doorstep. 

I am so so lost

TLDR; I got fired during the corona crisis in march, still fighting with the goverment for a settlement payment, while my boyfriend gets kicked out of the house if I stay any longer with him, but if im alone, I will lose my self sanity and stop taking care of myself just to be able to keep debt collecters away.",I lost my job during Corona crisis and slowly losing it,t3_gstuh8,0

depression,"First I should mention, I'm autistic.  I was diagnosed with the condition formerly known as Asperger's back in 1999 in my senior year of high school, while before then I thought I was just extremely shy.  

I grew up in a mentally abusive environment at home thanks to my asshole father, who also has been a hoarder since I was very little.  As long as I remember, there has been shouting in my house.  Mom and dad argued constantly.  Sometimes dad would get too mad and start throwing a tantrum, where he'd throw everything he could and break things.  He never got physical with either of us, but that's a small comfort. 

My mom supported me as best she could, but she was very overwhelmed and often said she had TWO children to take care of.  She never really taught me many life skills, but I do believe she was mentally stunted herself.  I taught myself most of what I know today.  Mom was a caretaker her whole life, first with her own father and older brothers, and then with dad and me.  She was very - not *conservative*, but let's say ""*trapped* in the past"".  She simply couldn't learn how to operate technology, like cell phones or a computer.  She liked using land lines with dial tones and (if she had to) library reference materials.  I'm surprised she could drive sometimes.  Now while I say that, she still let me be a tech savvy.  She took me out to buy my first computer (which I said I can do homework on, but we all know I just wanted to play Monkey Island on that thing)  We spent as much time together as she could, with her having a job and having to keep dad calm.  It's true she felt the brunt of his mind games and mental attacks.  

It killed her in the end, when she was having her second knee replacement surgery, she picked up a rare blood infection from the doctor not cleaning the surgical tools properly.  She got sicker and sicker, until her kidneys and bladder failed. Dad became very unhinged at the thought of losing her, and his ""nice guy"" facade he puts on for friends and neighbors vanished.  The police were actually called to remove him from the home.  They had riot gear on because dad told the State investigator who called in to check up on me that he was in the living room ""playing with his guns"".  So then he was gone, I was left home alone with dad's hoard, and I was taken by a friend to visit my mom every weekend.  She had given up on her own recovery, refusing to eat or go to therapy.  And the last memory I have of her is as a near-skeleton who was shouting for her dad to help her.  This was in 2018.  Her dad died before I was born, pre-1982.

Nothing was left to me, there was no money paid towards my future, and the house I grew up in needed to be sold to pay for dads new living arrangements at an Adult Protective Services facility.   

Before I could leave, I had to get help from family friends in finding a new family for my two cats because I couldn't take them with me.  The last memory I have of THEM was my female cat and her panicked wide eyes and mewling sounds of sadness and terror.  She had never been caged before, and I had to keep her in one so she could be moved to live with her new family  She was panting heavily, panicked.  What might have been worse is seeing my little munchkin cat.  His older brother died a year ago and they were inseparable, to the point he refused to eat his food, instead searching the house for his brother.  I was the one who coaxed him to eat, calmed him down at night when he was crying, and then he finally, *finally* started sitting on my lap.  Oh but no, sorry, we can't be together anymore, I'm sending you away.  When the lady came to pick them up, with my girl mewling and pleading, the munchkin just sat there n his cage, not reacting, not crying.  He just stared.  It was very out of character for him.  It was as if he just mentally broke.  Like he couldn't comprehend why this was happening to him.

I lived in a hotel room with my dog for a year.  I fought tooth and nail for my dog.  After what happened with my kitties, I didn't want to lose him too.  So eventually a hotel was found that allows dogs.  

Of course, because it's me, it didn't last.  We stayed in the hotel for almost a year before the State found a place for me to stay.  It didn't take animals so I also had to betray my dog too and give him away.   I made a promise then and there if I ever got my own home, I would **never** ever have any more pets.  How could I just replace them like that?  I was already enough of a monster.

More recently, my dad died of the virus, but I shed no tears for him, especially with how his guardian contacted me.  They asked me if I had anything I wanted to say to him.  I told them I'd think about it, at that point I figured, okay, I could either yell at him finally, or forgive him.  But it didn't actually matter, because about an hour later the hospital itself called me saying they've been trying to contact me until his guardian gave them my number, so they can tell me my dad passed away over the weekend, which was 4 days ago.  One last attempt at mental manipulation from beyond the grave.

I'm still having anxiety attacks and mental breakdown where I start pacing the apartment, angrily cussing myself out and just yelling at the top of my lungs, which I'm very surprised the neighbors don't hear.  Until I finally get a therapist, I'll go along with diagnosing myself with CPTSD.  Or maybe I'm just crazy, who knows anymore?

Of course I'm triggered by what's happening in the world right now, too.  Yet I feel too mentally old and tired to do anything but pace and scream.  I hate being informed, but I don't want to *not* know what's going on either.  I feel peoples pain, but I'm too weak to help.  I have barely enough money to support myself.  I'm scared of arguments.  I don't drive.

I have had life goals that I feel in my mind are too unrealistic for me to ever achieve, including owning my own home and having friends that I can invite over for summer barbecues like my mom used to do.  Except I don't want to live a long life in this world, so I don't think there's enough time to achieve my dream at this point.  I wish I could have started earlier.  I think most people avoid me because I can be a downer.  It's depressing to hang out with me although I do enjoy having friends around, what little I have.  I try to be happy for them.  Smiling and laughing gets exhausting so quickly though.  I just wish I had more than I do right now.  Everything happens slower for me.  My friends all have their own homes, are married with kids.  One is a single mom who just had a patio put up a few days ago.  I want to be happy for her, but I'm jealous.  Why is everyone else so much better off than me?

depression,"Hi, hopefully I can get some feedback. I don’t know what it is but I just feel like a failure. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the right thing. But don’t have the right mentors or leadership to actually take that next step. after reading this, I’m sure that a lot of you won’t think there’s an issue. It could just be me and I just want to be held at a higher standard.


To begin I’m currently a junior in college, 3.0 classes going great. I secured a internship which will continue this upcoming semester. Also plan on going to grad school when I’m done in New York. The only issue is that I feel like a failure, the only reason because I don’t have a job. The bulk of my money comes from either savings which I have around 2000 and money I get from either a FASFA check or from family to help while in school. During this summer it has been hard, my mother is supportive of me but brings me down on multiple occasions and just makes me feel like shit. I may be emotional but the things she says hurts my feelings and makes me feel like I should be doing better in life. 

Looking for a job has been a priority of mine, my sister recently got a job at a local supermarket. While I’m still looking for a job, but I’m having no luck so far. I have told her that I have enough money to not have to worry about getting a job right now in this economy. I don’t need anything right now to begin with. I want to change his mindset, I don’t have a problem working but the fact that I can’t get a job when the summer rolls around is bothering me

She always brings up the fact that I got fired from my previous jobs, due to little things like being laid off and racist managers. Everything seems to be my fault at the end of the day. I want to change this mindset within me. I’m a happy individual but when I get around my mother and start talking she makes me depressed even though I love her dearly she’s the only parent I have in my life. 

The question being what should I be doing at 22 that I’m missing out on because of thinking I’m a failure. This may seem like a brag post but it’s not I feel lost in life and that I should be doing something different right now.

Most of my hobbies range from hanging out with friends to reading and playing games. So me being in the house an entire day makes me feel like I’m wasting my life and should be at greater heights at the age of 22.

Two weeks ago I decided to try to do things and go out. I forced myself to start exercising so I went walking everyday for one hour, biking in the park. I started to search a job too, meditate more, start yoga again, try to avoid social media and internet...

Sadly it is not that easy. I don’t feel better inside. I thought doing lots of good things like that will help me emotionally but I had more anxiety (specially in the park when I see happy and noisy people everywhere) and troubles to sleep since then. Maybe it is adaptation, i hope so. 

Anyway today. Today I went walking in the street going to nowhere and found a little church in my neighborhood. It was opened and there were nobody in there (middle of the afternoon). I sat on a bench and felt really good. I was here, and just fine. I am an atheist but staying in a place like that makes me feel very calm. It makes me think how little I am, in this planet and space, how there were actually a lot of people who suffered century’s ago. I actually cried. It was relief. Lots of places have this effect on me like museums, huge landscapes, some libraries, nature.. but it is always crowded or hard to find in a city.

Churches are empty in afternoons most of the time. The light is amazing. The stained glass windows are beautiful. There is real silence. You can sit, or not. You can meditate. You can think. You can pray. It is huge, quite impressive. And it is fresh these days during summer. 

A little good moment in the day I wanted to share and I think I‘ll go to that church almost everyday.",Today I went into an empty church and it was the greatest decision of my week.,t3_gszvck,0
depression,"School is the only thing stopping me from committing suicide, I don't know what I will do without it. I just can't stay all day everyday with my parents, my mother screaming profanities at the smallest thing and hitting me on a daily basis, and my father who hasn't answered my texts in three weeks. (I only see him one day a month).

My mother already said I can't hangout basically with anyone (only once a month and with people she approves, only one in my whole fucking school). And, I won't have my phone until I finish all of the ""homework"" that she gave me, because she doesn't like the fact that school didn't.

Also the only teacher I genuinely cared about and that I thought cared about me has started ignoring me. We used to text a lot during quarantine because I liked speaking to her and she's a good listener, but a month ago she stopped answering, so I asked if she was okay and she said yes. but she hasn't spoken to me since. I wonder what did I do wrong. She hasn't asked me how I am in weeks, and I'm tired of emailing her randomly and rarely getting a reply. I really hope that at least she's happier now.

depression,"Mid twenties. Never want to follow up on anything. I just want to take life and do the bare minimum...but you can't really do that. You can't really do the bare minimum. Not if you want a place to live. I don't know. I pick one or two directions, maybe three. I just can't stick to anything. I get one thing done, one little step, and everything in my being, everything in my mind, everything in my body, just wants the work to be over with. There's always more. There's all the other steps you have to take to get to where you want to go. Each and every grueling step...after every achievement wishing that was just the end of it. 

I don't feel like celebrating. Nothing I do feels inherently good or worthy of respect. I just feel tired man. But I can't just take a nap. There is shit to do. I got plenty of stuff done this afternoon. But still, there is shit to do. There is always shit to do. 

I'm tired of continuously learning. I'm tired of studying. It doesn't matter what the end goal is. To have a life for myself, to make a decent income. Sure I could start a business...if someone else that wasn't me was there to give me the answers every step of the way. I'm just not that creative or free-thinking. Just the thought of deciding how much it would cost to get started doing something, or to start learning in a subject....it's enough to want to go to sleep forever. I want to study for as ASVAB, but I don't have the motivation to put in all the work I need to in order to do that. It's the same thing with studying anything. I just don't want to learn anymore. 

And I'm a coward. Too much of a socially anxious, conscious piece of shit. I'm not man enough to find clients for myself. I'm not man enough to put myself out there. I'm not man enough to build relationships with people. I try to put on a mask at work...I don't want to do that either. But I don't have a choice. 

I just don't have the energy to adapt to life's demands. I just get so tired. I just get so tired from thinking about anything, whether it's the future or the task right in front of me. It all just makes me so tired. I wish I could just slip away peacefully in my sleep. I heard a highschooler who just recently graduated on the radio today saying not to take the time you have for granted, that you have to enjoy what time you have left. But I don't enjoy it. There isn't a way for me to enjoy it. Everything just makes me so tired. I don't want to follow up on anything in my life. People tell me I need to keep my future in mind. I don't want to think about the future. I don't want the future to come to fruition. I just want to sleep. 

I wake up and work out. I try to be efficient and get my goal in for the morning. I usually fail at this. Not getting everything in I wanted to. Because I need to dedicate my time to things where it's actually needed. But I barely have the wherewithal to follow up with those things either. I barely had enough energy to leave the house again earlier in order to pick up the car I just bought with all the money I got from the government. That's a good thing; I needed this car. But I don't know. I'm still so tired. I got the damn thing and just went back home. There were things I needed to get from the store afterwards. Not really needed, more like investments in things that I could do to make money. But I'm so tired. I'm so tired of thinking about how to chase money. That's all there really is to most of life. Chasing money. Dreams come second. Might as well not have any dreams at all. I guess I really don't have them anyways. Goals I mean. I can tell myself, oh, I want to accomplish this, or oh, I want to accomplish that, but none of that is actually true. None of that is really true deep down in my soul.

I'm stuck in arrested development. Stuck in an endless, sad, pathetic nostalgia ride. It was video games. And music. And thinking about my old friends. My old love interests. The fun I've had in the past. No reverence for the presence or future. Just being inside in the air conditioning or outside in the sun inundates my entire being with nostalgia; a feeling of safety, safe places, familiar people, a lack of true responsibility. Would an actual adult ever want to go back to those days? Where they had less freedom? Perhaps. I to ignore them in life and live in their memory forever in death...all I want to do is sleep.","No motivation, no direction, no courage",t3_gszg9r,0

depression,"First thing's first: I CANNOT see a therapist for very complicated reasons, so for now I'm stuck trying to figure this out on my own. I'm also not going to disclose the reasons I can't for fear of self-incrimination (like I said it's complicated.) It has to do with my job. If there is a better reddit I should seek wisdom from, please suggest it in the comments. 

To start off, this is going to be a long rant of word vomit. I've never EVER talked about this topic with anyone, even my mom or older sisters. I'm not very good at speaking or writing or any of those types of subjects. Was always better at math and science. I'm a 27M so it's been 20 years since this happened. I grew up with no older brothers or other male role models in the house or around us. My mom never remarried or brought guys around. It was just us, but I don't think I've ever been happy or even know what that is. Sure I've had happy moments, but once that moment is over it's bad to the slump. Here lately though, probably the last 6-9 months, I've been on a huge self-help/self-improvement kick and I'm ready to try and tackle this part of myself (at least anonymously with total strangers so there's no judgment, or at least no judgment I'll care about.) 

So to start off I'm gonna say I don't remember much from my childhood after that incident up until maybe 7th grade, so 12 or 13. I remember the day vividly. I remember coming home from school to cop cars surrounding the house, and not knowing ehat was going on. I remember the funeral. I remember not crying at the funeral. I remember running away from home sometime after, though I can't remember my thoughts or reasons at that time as to why. I got put in the Big Brother/Big sister program after, but I don't think I understood why at the time and didn't really connect with the people because of it. Since then I've been a pretty cold person, short of the occasional sobs during sad movies. My aunt (mom's sister) died of cancer when I was 14. Didn't really feel bad at all (my mom's side of the family is all pretty close and so are us cousins). Basically I'm curious if I'm less capable of empathy(sympathy? idk which) because of it. With women I'm extremely affectionate, caring, and giving though. I tend to put their needs first. I've read stuff that said sometimes children growing up in single parent homes try and fill the void of the other parent with a s/o. I've always been either dating someone, or trying to date someone. Right now I'm consciously single though. Taken myself off the market. If that is an issue I want to fix it and not put that burden on someone else. I've also been addicted to porn, masturbation, and impulsive sex that leaves me feeling empty afterwards for as long as I can remember. Probably porn since I was 11, masturbation at maybe 12 or 13, and then sex at 14 with the first woman willing. Also trying to conquer this at the same time. Like I said, a huge kick. A few months ago one of my sisters tried to raise the topic with me and I immediately shut down. On the verge of tears. Just wanted her to stop talking. I couldn't even think about it. I think I made her feel bad about it, and I'd like to be able to discuss it with family members eventually, and apologize to her.

Basically looking for someone maybe experiencing/experienced the same situation willing to shed some insight. I'm horrible at putting my thoughts into words so I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out (also working on this and trying to write my thoughts everyday in a notebook).

In early March I got a gross case of pneumonia (thought it was Corona at the time, but antibodies came back neg when I could get a test this month). My doctor told me not to take other meds with my pneumonia antibiotics and so I didn't schedule a follow up. It felt normal to be depressed while sick anyways. 

I started lockdown early, March 6, because of my pneumonia. My office closed later that week. I kept justifying to myself that I didn't want to make an appointment. Didn't want to bother my therapist. Didn't think video therapy would work. Etc. So now I'm like 3.5 months off Prozac and not feeling great.

Shit got fucked up bc I started to annoy her with stalking and shit while also dealing with my puberty fuck ups with some dutch youtuber with 777k subs. Bc both felt unjustified.

For some fucked up reason I became a right winger and I can't get it out of my head I fucking can't. I also started threatening with terrorism at my worst time in life.

I got reported 2 times 3 crimes. ID fraud, Threaths and online stalking (in my country you get punished like normal stalking) nothing happened after my mental breakdown. I was worried that I would go to prison. Never happened bc of the nice cops and my confession I guess

To give background over the past 6 months I've been dealing with severe depression. I mean to the point where I break down every week and lose control of myself. I've been relying on my friends basically completely as they just want to help pull me out and help. I started the process to get help. Ive gone through a couple different counselors but I actually found one I liked finally. I have an appointment this coming Tuesday. Well this past tuesday I completely broke down and wanted to end it all. My best friend stayed on the phone with me all night so she knew i was safe. I had even written a suicide note. After Tuesday the feeling never really went away. I continued to feel like this and just bottled it up until it all came out last night. All my thoughts of self hatred, all my thoughts of how much i wanted the pain to end came out. And for some awful reason I read my note from the other night. And I decided that it was time to end it all. For real this time. I sent out one goodbye text to my best friend and kinda sat there for a few moments completely ready to do it. Completely ready to end it all. And right as i was going to do it I got a phone call. It was her and I even tried to ignore her call. But she kept calling. We talked on the phone and i was in a really really dark place saying some really awful stuff. She had someone in her family call 911 for her so she could stay on the line with me. And i realized this during the conversation and even got angry at her for doing it. Soon enough there was a knock at the door and my cousin was standing there. Hes a cop in our city. He heard the address and details come over and raced over to be there first. We sat outside and talked for a while. He decided not to take me against my will since I am actively trying to get help. But he also made me go somewhere I wouldn't be alone. So I called her back and just cried on the phone for a few hours. If she hadnt called me when she did i wouldn't be here today. That one phone call saved my life.",The worst night of my life. Sorry for the long paragraph.,t3_gstpzf,0

He is on the other side of the world now since he migrated months ago so I cannot be physically there to support him. He had it bad before like really bad.

it’s my mistake, if we got the tickets earlier we could have gone. The thing is, i want to make sure i get the tickets so i would need this relatively soon

the concert is in september but as i said i would need 900$ for two tickets one for me and one for my mom or dad.

depression,"First time posting to reddit. Not even sure I’m doing this right. I’ll try to keep this post as condensed as possible. Just need some advice. 

2 years ago me (23m) and my girlfriend (22f) had our first child. It was unexpected and with really no preparation for this, we had to move into her moms house together to raise our child for awhile until we got our lives on track and could move out and live on our own. 

Since I found out about the baby coming, I started dealing with depression, anxiousness, and all around worry. This would happen on and off for the first 1.5 years of my daughters life and whilst it was a bit of an obstacle, it did go away and things started getting better. Recently though, things took a bad turn for me. I was laid off from my job due to the covid pandemic. Within a week of being home, doing nothing, my depression quickly came back. Feeling of uselessness, wanting to give up, just overall feeling numb to life. Passion was gone. This is where I need some advice: because of my on and off depression, my girlfriends family look at me like a piece of trash. Her mother has called me a bad parent behind my back (which I’m not, but because some days I just need to take a step back and have time to myself, she considers me to just be slacking and lazy). It’s gotten to the point to where we pretty much both avoid each other. This past weekend me, my gf, her sister, and friend all had plans to go out on a boat ride. The night before these plans, I had a bad panic attack and pretty much sat up all night by myself in the dark just stuck in my own head, the next day I told my gf that I wasn’t feeling like going out on the boat. This in turn caused a lot of issues. My gf didn’t want to go without me, I told her she should go and enjoy herself and that I would just work through this slump, but she insisted. She messaged her sister and told them we wouldn’t be going. They showed up to our house anyways. Angry at us for cancelling last minute. Her friend was also angry for the same reason. And now it’s all awkward between my gf and her family. They think I’m dragging her down and what not, that I’m controlling her. When in reality, me and my gf are very happy with each other and she just wants to help me get through this. Not one time I have I asked her to do anything for me and I’ve made it clear that I will not because I don’t want my issues to get in the way of her life. Both her friend and her sister are in school to be registered nurses. Both of them talk on social media about how important it is to check up and help friends with depression, but it seems like since my depression has inconvenienced them, they’re angry with me and want me out of their life. I feel bad about all of this and it’s making it hard to recover. I don’t want to pull their family apart. I don’t want them to dislike me. I plan on marrying my gf one day and I’d like their approval. And you’d think since they’re studying to be nurses, they would be more open minded about this. And now I’m really worried that since they’re acting like this, it will cause my gf to also be against me. And the last thing I want is to lose her. How do I deal with this? Is this something I should just let blow over? We actually plan on moving out within the next month so it will get us away from the family for awhile, and maybe that will help in some cases. But the thought of them hating me just makes me feel even more crappy. Sorry for the long post. Feel free to leave me any advice and ask any questions. I’d really appreciate it.",Any advice?,t3_gsuztz,0
depression,"I've been considering posting this for a while, and always change my mind once I have a good day or two in a row and figure everything's great.

All in all, my life is pretty great, I'm not mad at that. I still have a job right now, good friends, a new girlfriend, a nice apartment, and often lots of exciting things going on in my life.

But still, I find myself laying in bed or on the couch frequently, feeling bad or angry at myself for where I'm at in life or past mistakes. I won't drag out a story, I'll keep that for my therapist. I've put in 2 years of talk therapy which has helped a ton, gotten out of a horribly toxic relationship, and cleaned up my life a ton, but this mix of anxiety and depression does truly limit what I'm doing in life. Problem is, it's mostly the past that leaves me feeling guilty, the present that makes me bored and hopeless, and the future that gives me anxiety. This isn't new either, it's been off and on and generally growing over the last few years - my last relationship really fired it up though.

I've missed work, I give up or postpone career goals, make excuses to not hang out with friends, or engage in self destructive behaviors out of disappointment in myself. I've started to wonder if going on meds for a year or so would help me to break out of this.

I'm currently on TRT which has helped quite a bit, but hasn't fixed things. I exercise very regularly, eat decently well (trying to get back on track there), and take much better care of myself than I used to. I have noticed I readily go for any substances that boost mood or lower anxiety - it's taken a lot of work to battle this, and I think it's a symptom of this rather than a cause.

I was on Parnate (an MAOI) years ago to get out of a rough spot, and while it didn't come without side effects, it got me out of a really rough spot. I tried other meds when I was younger, but I'm one of those people who believes MAOIs are the only ones worth a damn. I briefly tried Nardil but only gave it 2 days and was mad it made me tired. Considering how it'd impact my life if I gave it another shot.

I'm not desperate, but I do think I'm going to be facing some problems in my life that I can't fix anytime soon, and I believe they're holding me back from being the best I can be.",At what point do you consider going on something?,t3_gsz5kc,0

depression,"(NSFW, because of some morbid imagery near the end that may trigger someone. This kinda goes all over the place, as I suck at structuring posts.) 

Just venting I guess. I’ve been off and on depressed for a few years now. It gets better for a little bit then can randomly spiral back down. 

I’m not good at holding down a job, so I live with my parents for free in a big house they happen to own. I don’t pay many bills besides the power bill, so I have spending money saved up. I thought that buying a bunch of instruments (I’m musical) would help make me happy, it does temporarily and then I just forget about them sometimes.   I went and bought a bunch of Switch games (which are expensive, physical copies) thinking they’d make me happy. I barely play them. 

I just feel stupid, ya know? I’m a young woman, live in a beautiful home in a pretty place, I barely work, barely pay bills, I don’t have kids. Single. Don’t have to worry about relationships. 

There’s literally people living in a damn ditch somewhere probably eating raw meat trying to survive and feed their children, and meanwhile I’m here sulking about never being happy. Why does it always have to be this way? 

I know that everyone has problems, and I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others all the time. 

I guess I’m finally understanding what people mean by “materialistic things can’t make you truly happy” or whatever. I’ve been able to buy all the things I previously wanted (but couldn’t afford before) within the last couple of months, and I’m still off and on depressed. 

I feel like I have a ton of potential, but I’m wasting it by sitting here in my house day by day doing absolutely nothing. 

I’ll go weeks or months without cleaning, sometimes food in the fridge rots so badly it starts liquefying, dirty dishes piled up in the sink, dirty laundry piled up. I smell like shit most days because I don’t feel like showering, or brushing my teeth. It’s too hard. When it was real bad, I went a month without showering. It just seems like so much work when it really isn’t. My mom used to get pissed and disappointed when she’d come here and see that nothing was cleaned and the dishes were piled up, but now she doesn’t say anything anymore, as when I was confronted about it I’d just start crying since I felt useless. 

I barely eat, since I don’t like grocery shopping and going out. I just eat whatever scraps are laying around, snacks in the cupboard, or whatever my mom happens to bring with her. 

I continually have bad images coming into my head that I try to push out... since I live here by myself 20 mins away from the closest town, I picture myself dying in my sleep or something and my body starts rotting in my bed before someone finds me. My parents sometimes only come here every few days, or sometimes once a week. I just keep imagining them walking into my room and finding a cold body. 

I sort of forgot about those recurring thoughts, but then the other day my mom and I were having a deep talk, and she started crying when telling me that even though my dad doesn’t show it, he worries about me so much that he’s on the verge of tears sometimes. And I’ve NEVER seen my dad cry in the 20 years of my life. 

My mom said he worries that he’ll come here and find me dead in my room. Then all those recurring thoughts came back. 

I’ve become so desperate to fix my life, I started turning to Christianity again, but no matter what I do nothing helps. I get terrible nightmares almost every night (if not a nightmare, then a really vivid dream). They rob me of proper sleep and the imagery is so gross and disturbing that I always remember it and it makes me cringe during the day. I can remember almost every single one of my vivid dreams to this day. Apparently that’s kinda rare. I don’t remember every single detail? But I remember the plot and the people in it, the places, etc. 

Anyway as a desperate attempt I’ve been trying to quote bible phrases and psalms before I go to sleep, I say them out loud and everything. But the dreams keep coming. In a lot of dreams I get raped by shape shifting demons. One dream in particular I was about to be raped by my father, and when I tried running away he started pelting me with stones. I was all dirty and was only wearing just a little night gown that was in tatters. I can still remember that dream as it was traumatizing. 

I’ve had a relatively good life, I was never sexually abused by my parents, was never abused in general, had a pretty normal childhood. NO IDEA why I get these sick dreams. Must be just from depression and anxiety? No idea. 

I’ve been to therapists, spoke to a psychiatrist, took meds (I don’t take them anymore, they don’t do shit). Mental health care is also really hard to come by where I’m from. The waiting list to see a therapist is usually long, and they don’t even do anything. There’s a psychologist that travels up here once in awhile but the waiting list is months long. The need for mental health care here is so strong. They probably aren’t even worth it anyway. 

I’ve tried most things. Nothing helps. I’m not as suicidal or catatonic as I used to be, but still depressed and anxious. I’m actually able to shower and brush my teeth a bit more, do laundry a bit more, clean a bit more. So that’s good. But the nightmares, recurring thoughts, and sleep schedule are still messed. And I’m just still depressed in general. 

Guess I’ll just continue living and see what happens. I don’t have future plans or anything, since I’m bad at commitments. I’ll just wait it out and go day by day like I’ve been doing.

depression,"My dad (58) has always been there for everyone, no matter what. He's always been positive and just there for you, either for mental support or to help with any home improvement project you can think of. There's no way I would have ever thought my dad was severely depressed based on how he acted around me. I think he hid it because he wanted to be strong around his kids. 

About a year ago he was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer. I forget the name of it, but it is rarely fatal if managed properly with routine check ups and phlebotomy's. He's been on top of this and is doing great with it. Dr said he should live a normal life provided he continues to come in regularly. Then, after 25+ years working in a very physically exhausting job, he was asked to retire. This hit hard  but he bounced back and now has a pretty cool job he seemingly enjoys (granted much less income, but he also has his retirement which is not too shabby). Now, in hindsight I can absolutely understand why he would be depressed. He was honestly very positive about it around me and seemed to be taking everything well. His behavior seemed 100% normal. He was social with everyone, joked around, still acted like himself in every way. Didn't think there was a problem AT ALL. I honestly always thought it was crazy when people would say ""wow, we had no idea"" when someone commits suicide, because to me there HAD to be signs, but I understand that completely now. It's scary that someone could be in so much pain in their head but never display that to other people. 

The other day my dad wrote three notes; one to my mom, one to me, and one to my sister. He left documentation for his life insurance policies, tax documents etc on the table, left his cell phone at home, and left the house with his gun. My mom came home from work and found everything, called the police, and called me to come over. We got a 302 so that if the cops found him and he was alive, they can detain him. It was the most hysterical and stressful thing I have ever gone through. I thought I was never going to see my dad again. A police officer came over to update us on the search and while he was on our porch my dad pulled into the driveway. I was so relieved I literally hyperventilated.  

We went over and hugged him and cried, and the police officer explained that he had to take him to the hospital and was required to cuff him. My dad seemed surprised and insulted that we could do that to him. I think he expected to come home and just talk with us and everything would go back to normal and we could just forget this happened, which is ridiculous. Right now he is still in the hospital and being required to speak with counselors, but according to him they are telling him that he doesnt need to be there and is ok (I think/hope this is a lie to get us to let him come home early). He is very good at coming off as perfectly happy and rational, but I hope due to what happened these counselors can see past that. 

I spoke to him on the phone and he seemed like he understood what was going on and why he was there, and expressed to me that he also understood why we had to do that and was willing to open up and allow it to work, but when he speaks to my mom he says that he's angry we have him in there and contradicts that. I think he feels like he needs to not express himself to me because he doesnt want to be weak in front of his son. I really wish he could get over that and talk with me. He's been there for me my whole life, I just want to be able to be there for him now. Also, once he gets out of the hospital he has agreed to see a local (and fantastic) psychologist and has admitted that he needs to talk with someone, but we will see if his willingness continues.

PLEASE tell me how I can help. What can I do? Can I get him to open up to me? Should I even try, or just let him know I am here for him and dont push the issue? 

I have my BS in Psychology and from my neuro class when I was in school I remember that the hypothalamus (mood regulator portion of the brain) literally shrinks during  depression and regular exercise (in addition to standard treatment) helps cell regeneration in that area and begins to restore neuro connections and the exercise also releases serotonin which helps a lot. I actually got really into fitness years ago when my then fiancee ended things and it REALLY helped. My dad is already in relatively good shape, do you think pitching us exercising together would be a good idea? Maybe it can be a way to help him without asking him to become vulnerable with me?

But lately I’ve been slipping and slipping hard. It’s hard to look at myself lately, masturbate, shower etc. The only thing I can keep telling myself is that the world would be in a better place with out me in it. Lately my friends have been busy and kinda taken a step back from me. But I can’t help but convince myself that I’m a burden to them and that they are now flourishing because they’ve spaced themselves from me. I try justifying this too by telling myself that without them I’ll be independent and stronger but all I can feel is empty. I keep thinking of this bottle of pills I have but then I think if I were to take them I’d just be proving my point, I’d be a burden for someone to clean up. At this point the best way to describe how I feel is like a corpse or fish chum just getting picked clean by schools of fish, empty and shallow.

I see a lot of people hurting on the subreddit and not enough people helping (although I truly appreciate people with that beautiful attitude).

I tried to find a way out of this misery, but even before I was depressed I found it hard to explain my feelings to anyone that I personally know. But at that time it wasn't such a big problem not to talk to anyone, or so I thought.

I want so hard to talk to somebody known to me about what I'm feeling, but I can't stop thinking that I'm not worth listening, like there are thousands of people that have a thousand more reasons to be depressed.

If anyone who sees this post would've met me in reality they would have never guessed that I suffer from depression, I would think that I am the happiest man alive.

I was hurt so much that I'm at a point where I don't care if anyone hurts me. I'm just trying to make anyone that I can smile. The thing is I don't really feel anyone really cares about me, like really cares about me. Yeah, sure they do care, but in more of a physical way than a enotional one. No one even tried to ask me how I'm feeling, how I'm really feeling.

So, I don't really care about myself anymore, but I don't have suicidal thoughts. If I kill myself I would not be able to try to get other people out of this state before its too late.

depression,"Hey humans,

Today I was texting some old (silenced for months) contacts (total count 2) for learning material of a class in university and in these contacts was one (let's call it o1), who is still a friend of another lost contact, which was hurting me recently and blocked me before I even could defend myself (let's call it t1). (I get overwhelmed in such situations quite easily, didn't really know where to begin with because these aggressive text-messages were bombarding me. So I froze and were only able to answer to some unnecessary points, even didn't explain my answers well enough until it was too late.) But I don't mind the lost contact (t1), because it was the fourth time I got very toxic messages from this person and I don't want to experience this ever again. But the hurting words last and won't go away. I didn't figure out how to get rid of them yet.

Now I feel like these words will chase me forever because I got a rude answer from the one old contact (o1) who is a friend of the lost contact (t1). I was texting my question to another old contact (o2) who I know had this class too and got a kindly and helpful answer with learning material. I also know that this old contact with the rude answer (o1) is normally also very kind and helpful. So I wonder if my lost contact (t1) was bad-talking me to my old contact (o1) because they are still friends. I know this could all be my imagination and nothing like this happened, but thinking about it let me feel worse I already was.

I know one of my bad habits which causes this heavy depression is that I am overthinking everything too much, but I can't stop thinking about every single detail of my bad experiences with people and they are even chasing me since my childhood, growing and getting more.

depression,"Hi, I'm 23, autistic, have a mild physical disability, I'm in college for Business/Accounting, and felt down and depressed (no clinical diagnosis) for a while now. I have had unrequited romantic feelings for someone for about a year now... they had once hinted that I needed to be more of an adult for them to even have a chance to take interest in me, so I've been trying to work on getting a driver's license since September.

I have given up on actively getting them feeling the same way for me, but I still feel so strongly about them that I still want them to be a part of my life as a friend... but it seems like they've stopped even caring about me as a friend. They say otherwise if I ask, but I know how I feel.

So I decided to get a job to be more worthy of their time as a friend, to give myself some purpose during the summer while I only have one class, and to help my mom out with some of the bills. It's retail, so I'm barely making more than minimum wage an hour, and only about 20 hours a week, but I thought it would be a great start to get used to working.

It has been horrible. My boss is nice and so are my co-workers, but I feel woefully incapable of being able to perform anything at my job. I'm slow at stocking freight because I can never find where any of the products go. I'm slow at checking out customers at the register (and I even had a scare about being short one day, but I ended up just miscounting my register and was $0.03 over.) I'm even painfully slow at fronting and facing items on shelves. I ended up having to work a 14 hour day too. I ate some food at my break but I was also running off of no sleep.

Worst of all, last Friday, I was assigned to unloading the truck. I was slow at that too, like everything... plus I started getting increasingly winded and eventually could barely breath. I would have thrown up if I had eaten any breakfast or dinner the night before. I barely got halfway through before the assistant manager swapped me out to the register.

20 hours already feels like too much... and now because a new hire bailed, I'm going to get more hours this week. My boss and coworkers can't pity me for my performance forever, and I'll get fired if I don't have a mental breakdown and quit on my own. I couldn't only get about two hours of sleep tonight either.

I feel like a complete, abject failure. If I can't handle this, I probably can't handle any job. It's obvious why that person never wanted to be with me, I'm a perpetual child who can't support anyone.

I was happy until one day, then I got horrible physical symptoms with unknown cause, according to my doctors it's anxiety, but none of the fucking treatments for anxiety work.

A year after this I also started experiencing severe anhedonia and inability to focus, as if I didnť suffer enough already. I started therapy with one of the best therapist in my city and after 33 sesssion I can say that it didn't help at all and I don't even know how talking about emotions could help ever help me. Yes I might recognize some emotions better, but that doesn't stop them from happening, at least not for me.

SSRIs only made extremely apathetic and emotionally blunted but at the same time didn't help my anxiety at all - not even 1%. Vortioxetine was the same plus it gave me horrible stomach pain. Mirtazapine was the same, but also made me extremely lethargic. Wellbutrin at least helps a little with the amotivation and apathy, but it makes the anxiety a little worse as well.

depression,"TL;DR: My friend, who is a minor, is very depressed and is struggling with suicidal thoughts. She refuses to call any hotlines. She attempted suicide yesterday. What can I do as a friend to help her?

I'm 16 and my friend is 15. We live apart, and she still lives with her parents. My country is still in lockdown, although it's slowly opening up, but this whole thing has been hitting her hard.

Yesterday she told me she wanted to kill herself, and had been wanting to for a while. She had a panic attack through text after that, she couldn't breathe very well, and then she started feeling lightheaded and ""sleepy"". I told her to try and describe her surroundings and focus on her breathing while I asked her questions. It turned out she had eaten close to nothing the entire day, so after she calmed down I told her to go eat something more. She's had trouble keeping food down lately, so I told her to try to eat something liquid, like a soup, or just something light. I've yet to check up on her today, to see if she managed to eat something or not, and if she's feeling better, but I plan on doing so.



How can I help her? She refused to call a hotline yesterday, and she's, in general, shown a disregard for professional help. Is there any resource I could get her...? I really don't know anything. If you know any numbers that don't take personal information and don't act on it, then I'd really appreciate it. I'm in Portugal. Yesterday I spent the entire night searching but I couldn't find anything. She's been more alone at home lately, and I know that I might not always be there for her when she needs me.

I think she hasn't been taking care of herself lately, not eating enough, not taking her meds, getting little sleep, things like that. She jokes about it, and it's worrying me. Would it be patronizing of me to remind her...? She also drinks, and she takes hard meds. It worries me. She says she's been trying to cut on her drinking habit, but I don't really press it. Is it okay if I ask her about things like that?

If she feels suicidal again, is it okay if I ask her why she's feeling like that? I didn't bring it up because I thought it might make her feel worse, because she'd be forced to confront what's making her feel suicidal in the first place.

depression,"Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents. 

To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later) 

The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"". 
She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.

Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped.
Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")
 Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old.
Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!)
Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams.
Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses.
Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"".
Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.

And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story. 

Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house. 
But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.

Cooking, cleaning, cheering me up when I need it or even just attempting to.
Today he snapped. I hadn’t left the bed once and when calling to ask what he wanted for dinner he muttered- “why can’t you be a better wife and just surprise me for once”. Those words shattered my heart to pieces.

He instantly called me back apologizing. To be fair he’s never snapped at me before, but wow did that sting. He’s the most productive person on the planet. Runs a business, active with charity groups, avid gym goer / social butterfly. And then there’s me- his “lazy” wife. He’s never called me lazy but I know he thinks it. He’s hinted at it so many times as some days I’m incapable of doing something as simple as cleaning the kitchen. He’s the son of 2 gourmet cooks so of course his food is amazing. He plates the food and goes the extra mile. Being depressed means just getting out of bed is a victory. Cooking something easy and putting it on regular plates.

depression,"Weird title, I know. But bear with me. 

To start, I'd summarize my family background by saying I was diagnosed with ptsd as a result of it. That's kinda all I wanna go into there. Now we're here and I'm a college aged adult. 

Basically I feel like I've spent my whole life hurting and because of that I'm terrified of doing anything the might cause any person the slightest bit of harm. I'll obsess over it. Today, I accidentally cut a car in line at the drive thru. I felt like shit the entire time through the line that I left money to help pay for their order with an apology for cutting in line. I know that seems like the normal and good thing to do but I don't feel like I do it for the Right reasons. Not to be a good person and say sorry but to alieve my own stress because if I didn't say something then it'd bother me for who knows how long. 

Now take this situation and apply it to my friendships. I get so scared that I said or did something wrong at the drop of a hat. I'm sensitive to changes in tone and posture so I'll notice but not say anything. Then I let it fester and worry until my apology to that person, if the instance needs one, becomes more about me than them. We might arrive at the conclusion that our friendship is okay but I feel like I did something wrong still on a personal level. Of course, sometimes it's not ok though and they no longer want to remain in contact which I think is fair.

This leads to me internalizing and feeling like I'm in a cycle of being a bad person, a person who hurts people. Then I want to hurt myself because why live when you hurt other people? I can't cope with that. 

I don't know what's wrong with me or what to do about it. I've seen therapists actively, I'm not single (so I must not be The Worst Ever), I have great academics and do well at work.

Though some stars are most likely gone, their flickering light still reaches my eyes. Just like that star dissappeared, one day I will too, its life vanished, so will mine. A thought pops into my head. Will I ever be like those stars? That even though they have vanished millions of years ago they still light up the night sky? After my death, will I shine a light on what remains? Are we all here for a reason? One star calls my attention the most, the largest star.  Alone, without any other star close to it. They pop into my head, I can't help but smile. The star brings their memory to me. I remember all those ""I love you"" even the ones I did not utter. What I would give for 5 more minutes by their side. The cycle of life does not allow this. I thank God for every moment I had with you. Every laugh, every hug, every kiss. I hope to one day create that same impact. Tears begin to caress my face, with a breath I regain my composture. My dream is to one day find the same love you did. So strong that you death was only weeks apart. I hope you are ""the eternal love"" together. That love of which I have distanced myself and hope to return to one day, but most importantly I hope to have someone to share it with. My heart becomes filled with peace. ""She"" pops into my head. A feeling I have not allowed myself to feel in a long time overpowers me. I leave in the hands of God what must be. I do not know what the future holds but I hope ""she"" is in it. I silence my thoughts, I savor the night and hope to keep it in my memory forever. In the solitude of my roof, I realize I'm not alone, I am with myself. My true self, the me I wish the whole world could know, the me I wish ""she"" will get to know. I hope I'm good enough for her, even though I most likely haven't met ""her"" yet. I wonder what she must be doing while I right these words. Is ""she"" thinking what it would it be like to meet me, like i'm dying to meet her? Up until now I am sure I have done nothing to deserve her. I do not know how much is left for that destination, in the meantime I hope to enjoy the journey. The sun is beginning to rise, I hope this day brings wonderful things to her, things she can tell me about one day, just like I'll tell her about tonight.

 Heme aqui, viendo el cielo en la madrugada. Mi mente vacia, pero llena al mismo tiempo. Viendo las pocas estrellas que la ciudad me deja ver. Aunque probablemente esas estrellas ya no esten, su luz parpadeante aun llega a mis ojos. Asi como aquella estrella se desvanecio, su vida se acabo, asi acabara la mia. Una pregunta no se va mi cabeza. ¿me tocara ser como las estrellas? Que aun cuando ya murieron hace millones de años, aun alumbran el cielo nocturno. ¿Sera que yo también algun dia, mucho tiempo despues de mi muerte, tambien me toque alumbrar?¿Sera que realmente todos estamos aqui por una razon? Una estrella en particular cautiva mi atencion. La mas grande que puedo ver. Solitaria, sin alguna a su alrededor. Llegan a mi cabeza, no puedo evitar sonreir. La estrella me trae su recuerdo. Recuerdo todos los te quiero, los te amo hablados, y los no hablados. Lo que daría por 5 minutos a su lado. Pero el ciclo de la vida lo impide. Agradezco a Dios cada momento que me regalo con ustedes. Cada risa, cads abrazo, cada beso. Espero algun dia yo causar el mismo impacto. Las lagrimas empiezan a acariciar mi cara, con un suspiro recupero mi compostura. Mi mayor sueño ahora es encontrar el amor que ustedes tuvieron. Tan fuerte que su muerte solo tuvo semanas de separación. Ahora espero esten gozando juntos del amor eterno. El amor del que me he alejado y espero algun dia volver, pero mas que nads, tener con quien compartirlo. Mi corazón se llena de paz. Llega ella a mi cabeza, un sentimiento que no me he permitido sentir en mucho tiempo se apodera de mi. Dejo en manos de Dios lo que tenga que suceder. No se lo que me espera en el futuro, pero espero ella, sea cual sea su papel en el, si es que lo hay, este en el. Traigo silencio a mi mente por un rato, saboreo la noche y espero guardarla produndamente en mi memoria. Aqui en la soledad de mi techo, me doy cuenta que no estoy solo, estoy conmigo, mi verdadero yo, el yo que quisiera que el mundo conozca, el yo que aquella persona especial va a conocer. Espero ser lo suficientemente bueno para ella, y estoy consciente de que probablemente aun no la haya conocido. Me pregunto que estará haciendo mientras escribo estas palabras. ¿Estata pensando en como sera conocerme asi como yo muero por conocerla? Hasta ahorita estoy seguro que no he hecho nada para merecerla. No se cuanto falte para llegar a ese destino, pero por lo pronto espero disfrutar el viaje. Esta empezando a amanecer, espero este nuevo dia venga con cosas maravillosas para ella y que algun dia me cuente sobre ellas, asi como de seguro yo le contare de esto.",I have translated something I wrote a few years ago.

Some days I try to do something productive but get extremely tired and instead sleep the day away. Meanwhile i spend my nights staring at the ceiling unable to sleep.

depression,"I'm new to this, and Reddit in general, but I'll try to put this in words. Basically, a while ago after a failed attempt at suicide, I just kinda made a promise to myself to never try it again because my mom had depression before me and I was afraid that If I succeeded she would try it too. I also have two little siblings and a few cousins living with me. So I know I won't or at least shouldn't try to kill myself again, but it feels like my body gets heavier every day. Like I know I have to survive and keep getting through this, but it physically hurts to stay here. My family cares about me, I know that- and I love them too, but it just feels like a weight on me everyday. I want to be here for them and to watch them grow, but at the same time I'm so tired of everything. Everything's so heavy all the time. Does anyone else feel like that? Is there a way to stop it? I'm already on meds and see a therapist occasionally, but It keeps getting worse.

Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better, and I try to believe it. It's probably true. But it's been years. And when I'm not just plain tired, I'm very irritable. I don't want to get mad for no reason- and for the most part I'm good with controlling my actions for it, but I hate being mad. I just realized I'm rambling. Oh well.

depression,"Growing up, I never quite understood why I wasn’t holding a parent’s hand, but my own. I looked up to see I’m right outside the house, like a stranger observing through a window and figuring out what this was, if this is what a family was supposed to look like. Whenever I’d enter, I am indifferent. The odd one out, both literally and figuratively, I was the fifth and the last. I was given away early on. I never truly knew what or who I was when I have lived all my life forcing myself to believe that I was needed, wanted. That my main job was to calm them down, to keep them smiling at me, and just stay out of their way. It’s embedded in me to not cry when no one else is crying or not be angry but be grateful instead, or stop questioning things when they’ve given you life. No one mentioned anything and that left me unprepared. Now that I’m an adult, it’s really hard to be honest about what’s inside of me — my feelings, my thoughts, my wants and needs, my own choices — just to know who I really am before they molded me into someone who always acts like nothing that happened ever hurt me.

People and things keep happening and they leave with parts of you that you’ll never get back. I tried getting perspective to keep myself sane, you know, to practice gratitude and kindness again and again towards the little things even to those who don’t deserve it. That never worked because I was just trying to by-pass grief. I knew grief too well, and in mourning, you numb yourself. You disconnect yourself. Maybe that’s why I love watching films. I always wanted to disconnect myself from reality, and hopefully, if an unexpected scene gives me a chance to cry about every tragic thing from it, then I could finally feel something and connect that to everything that has happened to me for at least a few seconds. Most of the time I’d just feel bad that I ended up not crying at all, and punish myself for being too vacant again.

I retreat once more because thinking about it makes you never want anything like that to happen again, but then it keeps happening right? Two decades in this world made me realize that you can mourn a loss that has or has never been yours. If you look at it in another way, it’s also a little life that’s ending. And it starts and ends again. I’ve been mourning the death of my youth for as long as I can remember, and I’m not even half of the way out of the lives I’ll try to exist to. I tried healing a lot of times. I turned to vices, to pleasure, to pain — both people and material things. I just wanted to love love. I had so much love in me I don't know where to put it to. Nothing seemed to work. I volunteered, did art, willingly gave it away, and every time I hoped it would boomerang. I kept asking why it never did nor lasted. Why can’t it happen right just this once?

Is there a greater word for exhaustion to describe this heavy cloud around me? I can't see through it. I can't just make it go away. I needed it to stop. At times, I bury my head into my pillow, suffocating myself so I could get my brain to process this. Not wanting to do or be *anything*. It's so hollow here that if my soul would scream into my ears, my body would just echo it back. Rarely there'd be a tiny light that burns to remind me more that I actually want to live, but I’m so scared of doing it that I don’t end up living at all. The cycle repeats.

depression,"Sorry, this is a super super long post but other than my therapist I have nobody else to talk to about this and I haven’t been seeing her often. I don’t actually expect anyone to read everything. It’s just that I’m having one of those nights where I’m struggling to fall asleep. This is my 4am brain dump. 

When I was young my parents didn’t make a lot. Mom worked for minimum wage and dad didn’t make that much more but they saved so much just to give me more opportunities. I went for all kinds of classes to try things out (piano, swimming, art, skating, etc.) In school I did really well and was one of the top of my class every year. I’m an only child so anytime there was anything to be done around the house I would be the one to do it. Such as translating and taking care of important mail, sealing the driveway, repainting the window trims, mowing the lawn, shovelling the snow, installing light fixtures, repair of any item or electronics, fixing the fence, etc. I learned to do so much throughout the years so that I could help out my parents. 

Then came the end of high school where I started to get depressed and really bad anxiety. It was so bad I’d start crying in class in the middle of a lesson. It was super embarrassing but I couldn’t help it. The school social worker would meet up with me every week and further recommended a place for therapy. The people were nice but long story short I hated it because I felt like they thought I was crazy. My grades dropped and I couldn’t get into my top pick for university so had to settle for a different one. 

Skip to now and I’m supposed to be graduating university this year, except... I’m not. It was supposed to be my last year but my depression and anxiety have gotten so bad that I took a medical leave for the school year off. My friends, family, and boyfriend, to this day still don’t know about this... yes, I hid it from them since September 2019 and pretended to go to school. I really wanted to be honest and come clean but I couldn’t do it. Every week my therapist and I would work on building up enough courage to tell them and gave myself a deadline but it would keep getting pushed back. Now with the pandemic going on, it’s not suspicious that I’m not attending a graduation ceremony. 

I was prescribed Prozac almost a month ago but it hasn’t been helping (doctor said it takes time). If I could have it my way I would just leave this life. The pain I have to hide every day is so exhausting and becoming unbearable. The only thing keeping me here is my grandma. She helped raise me ever since I was born and she’s 90 now. I would take her out shopping, for food, help her shower and wash her hair, etc. My mom does a lot but I know she’s tired so I do the most that I can. My grandma is very dependent on me which I’m fine with because I love her so much. I know taking care of her doesn’t only mean physically but also an emotionally which is why I always talk to her and make sure she knows she’s loved. She would be really hurt if I were gone. 

I had so many opportunities growing up and my parents sacrificed so much for me, moving to a new country without knowing anything or even speak the language. From a young age it seemed like I was ahead of everyone and more mature since I had to grow up fast and help my family out with things around the house and in everyday life. Everyone mentioned how my future seemed so bright, yet here I am with no university degree, no job, no direction in life, no purpose. I’m always scared that what if this isn’t “high functioning depression” and that maybe I’m actually just a lazy fuck who is sad for no reason?? I know killing myself would hurt my family a lot but the pain and guilt just eats away at me every day and I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

Getting kicked out of school, getting into drugs/alcohol, betraying people I loved. I just feel useless. I feel I will never be able to feel loved again, I will never be looked at the way I want to be. And, I don't know what to do about it. I'm 18 years old, going to be a sophomore in college, at a school that I don't particularly like. I don't have many friends in general, I only have a cousin that lives in the area and I managed to piss her off big time. And now Im just stuck in this utter feeling of being a waste of space. My younger sister will constantly use that term, ""waste of space,"" when we argue, and the worst part is I can't argue with that. And because I'm the older sibling I have to know better. 

In terms of suicidal thoughts they've definitely come up more frequently in the past few days than before. But, I just think about how my problems shouldn't feel like real problems. I mean, there are kids my age that are homeless or have been at younger ages. People that are out of a job, being evicted from their homes, etc. And here I am, just sulking about my life on the internet.

I just wish something or someone would give me the push to do something. But I'm afraid of what that something is.

depression,"I haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional yet, but would a fully functional human being be sitting on the kitchen floor crying for multiple minutes over their gender identity and fear of becoming obese and fear of failing school because they can't focus or care about their schoolwork anymore? Would their father, who's grown up with depression, be concerned about them because they recognize signs of depression in their recent behavior? Or is this just them trying to be quirky and relatable, because everyone knows that crying over not wanting to be in your body with your face and overthinking everything you've ever thought about yourself to make you seem like a terrible person is such a fucking unique personality trait. Maybe by posting this, I'll actually be seeking attention and trying to trick people into thinking I'm a #depressedteen and #notlikeothergirls. I don't even fucking know if I am a girl. Fuck, I don't even know if I'm faking it or not, I haven't even been professionally diagnosed yet, so I don't have the right to suspect anything. Maybe when I wake up tired after sleeping 9 hours, I'm just being a typical lazy teenager. Maybe when I procrastinate on my schoolwork, only to panic about not doing my schoolwork and procrastinating even more because I already have enough stress thinking about catching up on my schoolwork, I'm just being rebellious and cool. Why can't I just do it  it's not that fucking hard, I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being if I can't get this shit done. God, why can't I just be a better person? Why am I like this? I don't want to be here, I just want to stay in my room and rot away to nothing. That's all I'm good for. Anyone who says otherwise is obviously lying and only keeps me around out of pity or moral obligation. Who would want me around anyway, with my lazy ass and pathetic excuses? I'm an awful human being, they're either delusional or they knew already and want to trick me somehow. Nobody actually wants to be my friend. I don't want to play the victim, I'm not a victim, I'm just lazy and pathetic. How can I be a victim when I sit on my ass all day and do nothing to improve myself? At this rate, I'll grow up to be a mound of fat on a couch, gulping down 20 pizzas a day. I say this as I realize that you could probably mistake my arms for sticks.

depression,"The last few months have been really hard for me. I didn’t lose my job to Covid but instead I got overloaded with more and more work. Which was okay at first because I could work from home. 

But now I feel days go by and there’s nothing in for me but the money. I feel every day is the same, I am overloaded with things I don’t want to do, waking up too early (I get around 3 hours of sleep per day) and I have no friends, I don’t get any texts at all, and I love a guy who doesn’t, or will ever love me back. 

Every day has been more and more painful, and I just want to give up already. I closed my social media and nobody even noticed, nobody ever asked, and honestly I think nobody really cares.

I sometimes wish I could get sick, sometimes I wish I could simply die. I think a lot about dying and the only thing keeping me alive is my love for my parents, I could never do this to them, but I feel so much pain and some other times I’m just so numb. I want this to be over but I feel like it’s just getting worst every day. 

I wish I could get profesional help, or even a puppy but I’m responsible for my family’s expenses and I simply can’t afford my mental health, or caring for someone else. 

I feel so tired and I feel like the day goes by but I’m not here, I don’t care about anything anymore.

depression,"I started on bupropion XL about a week ago. I've found myself feeling kinda weird this week, but idk if I just didn't notice it before. For instance, I'm super jumpy. People have to walk near to me at work, but sometimes I'll be so lost to the world that I'll tune in and they're right there or they'll make me ""wake up"" and it startles me really badly.

Also, I have a lot of moments of feeling not real. Like, just fleeting moments, mostly, but every now and then it'll last longer. It doesn't really bother me, because I know it's pretty common with depression, but that lingering feeling is kind of uncomfortable.

Also, I just lose track of conversations a lot. I forget what I was saying or what the other person just said. It's getting irritating. I feel like I'm being rude, but it's not intentional.

All that happens along with a few of the side effects (namely being dizzy and sleepy and little appetite).

I'm in a tough life situation as well, so it could be something to do with that?

It's better than planning my suicide and will and stuff the way I was before. If nothing else being sick from the side effects disrupted that. But it's still weird and annoying and I would like it to improve.

On a bright note, though, I'm thinking a lot more about my future lately and about my goals and how to make them happen. I think that's just a side effect of having good friends who remind me regularly of my potential and of what I want in life. It's nice, though.

Telling myself that I’m a weak person if I even dare to reach out to anyone and talk about what’s going on with me.

And everyone tells me how lucky I am or that I had many guardian angels watching me. I wish it would have killed me. Every day is a constant struggle. Initial injuries were a broken hip, fractured wrist, gash up my foot, and a concussion. For 3 months I couldn't walk and I needed help being bathed and going to the restroom. That hasn't been the worst of it. About a month after the accident I got a severe migraine. It was to the point of vomiting and feeling like dying. It last most the day and eased into the evening. It was my first experience with a migraine. It happened again the next day and the day after. For 6 weeks I couldn't even get out of bed. My head hurt so bad. I couldn't take it. The nearest neurology appointment was a month out. It felt like a life time. I eventually was prescribed medication and diagnosed with post traumatic disorder. My migraines became fewer to 2 days per week. And although it was better, even 1 a lifetime is too many. My doctor increased my medication until I was practically a zombie.

I won't bore you with the details, but long story short, everything stopped and I found myself sitting home doing nothing for the past 2 and half months. Every time the lockdown ends, they extend it another month or so and each time I get further away from my dreams and this has caused depression and anxiety.

I don't feel like doing anything at all. I fear the night because, for some reason, those feelings intensify during the night and I struggle to sleep.

My question is, I know this is mainly due to the situation and not being able to do a thing, but will I ever go back to my old nature? Will I get my interest in things back? my dreams and passion? is this going to stick around forever, or will it go away and how can I make it go away faster?

depression,"Sure... I’ve had bad things happen; death, breakups, sickness, financial issues, bad jobs... they all got me depressed. But it was always a passing thing. Usually within a few weeks, at most. Who knows, maybe I’m just not recalling things correctly either. 

However, now for the last couple years, I’ve felt life is totally pointless, that I don’t have a future and have been driven deeper and deeper into solitude and depression. I am happily married. I make plenty of money. I have a nice home. I have a newer car. Nothing came easy. I came up from a poor family who lived on food stamps and in a home with sporadic joblessness and alcoholism. We never starved, I wasn’t molested or beaten, I was not neglected, but it wasn’t an easy childhood. I’ve worked very hard for everything i have. I’m starting to cry right now because I don’t understand. My life is likely the envy of many people. But, something is wrong. I can’t place it and I just don’t understand. 

I’m not scared of dying, not at all. 

I just wish I could to see a future for me. But I just don’t. I don’t want to sit around and rot away that’s not a future. I don’t want to become someone who sits around on the computer, reading Reddit and watching porn most of the day. Yet, here I am.

depression,"I’m a 21 year old only child, which sounds amazing to some, but I grew up in a very tense household. Don’t get me wrong, when we lived In California our live was great and carefree. My dad’s job moved us to Detroit when I was six and all I can remember is that since that move everything went down hill. My relationship with my mother grew worse as the years went on, and although I wasn’t the perfect child or teen she did not give me much motivation by telling me I was doing chores and having friendships ‘wrong’. My dad since moving, because of the tense relationship between his side of the family and my mom, grew angrier and angrier. It even got to the point of if there wasn’t telling and screaming in the house I would shake to wait for it or even spur it to get it over with. But this was when I was in my teens. 

Now as a senior in college and more relationship experience to go on, my mom and dad have mellowed out anger wise. But their words are more vicious than ever. Unrelated, I started developing symptoms of depression and that leads to the major depressive disorder that I have today. Due to the world situation, being in a place a long time isn’t the best. 

So I give all this backstory to ask for help. I recently went through a major depressive episode two days ago. I couldn’t sleep or eat and all I could really do was just sit and stare at the wall for hours. Now I’m feeling a bit better, but I just had a talk with my dad. He said that he is sad too, which he has told me before, and that he gave up a life that he was leading (a bachelors lifestyle of going to the gym and looking good) for my mother and I. He said that it doesn’t help that his daughter is depressed and that he has to do the lawn chores, which I do regularly help with but not during my episode a couple days ago I will admit, and that he is on the brink of being done with my mother. 

I’m asking for help. I don’t know if he truly means to blame me. I wasn’t planned and my parents weren’t even married and my mother was supposed to not have kids on account of a condition. But when he talks about the past he lights up. Then when he gets into his life and profession, he spits disappointment. I don’t have close friends, and I really feel reddit is the only place I can turn to. Please help me understand something I’m not seeing.",I need desperate help with my dad,t3_gsn9k8,0

depression,"I don’t really need any advice, but I need to get this of my chest. I’ve struggled with undiagnosed depression for about the last 5 years. Last summer I went through a bad breakup (due to me being depressed and not meeting their needs), moved out from living with my roommates, and started living by myself in an apartment. I had no friends and saw nobody all day. All I did was work. By the time I started to feel better and started hiking and exercising again, it was almost winter and seasonal depression started kicking in. Finally around the end of January I got some motivation back, started exercising again, and would go hiking on my days off when I could drive over where there was no snow. Then at the beginning of February, I wake up in the hospital.

I had worked all night, drove my coworker home and had just left his place. I was told that about a block after dropping him off, someone had fallen asleep at the wheel and T-boned me going about 50 mph in the middle of the city. I still don’t remember a thing. I had a pretty bad concussion, fractured 5 ribs, had a punctured lung, and fucked up my knee somehow. I stayed in the hospital overnight but was released the next day. 

Since I’m a waitress, I obviously wouldn’t be able to work until my ribs were healed, which I was told was going to be 4-6 weeks. I’m a fairly active person and I hate sitting still, so that was going to be hell, but doable. I was in a ton of pain, and my knee hurt worse than my broken ribs, even though the x-rays didn’t find anything. But I figured it would get better with time.

Finally 4 weeks after my accident, with my knee still hurting terribly and not being able to straighten, my doctor ordered an MRI. Two weeks later, I met with an orthopedic surgeon, who told me that I sprained a ligament, had a bone bruise, had a huge amount of cartilage chipped away almost to the bone, and had torn my meniscus-which would need surgery or else I would never be able to straighten my leg again. Luckily, I was able to get surgery scheduled for 2 days later since most elective surgeries had been cancelled (the only good thing to come from the coronavirus).

The surgery went well, but I was in a ton of pain and was stuck in a brace and on crutches for 6 weeks. I could do all of my own basic care but couldn’t make my own food or even reach my foot to put on my socks. Luckily I had moved in with my sister and another roommate a couple weeks before my accident so I was not alone. But I still hated having to be taken care of and not being able to do anything.

Quarantine didn’t help with this at all. I just kept thinking about how much hiking I could be doing or that I could be playing tennis, and I didn’t have any friends to talk to even if there wasn’t a quarantine. I had nothing to do for 6 weeks other than watch Netflix or play video games, which I get bored of very easily. All I could do was think about how terrible my life was and that I may never be able to play tennis again and I’m only 22, and that it was someone else’s fault. I’ve also gained a lot of weight due to not being active and stress eating, so that makes me feel even worse about myself and have lower self confidence than usual.

When the 6 weeks were up and I could finally walk again, my life was starting to turn around. I could make my own sandwiches (Small victories)! Walking was more difficult than I thought it would be because I lost a lot of muscle in my leg, but I made improvements and a week ago I walked 5 miles with very minimal pain. 

But within the last few days, my knee has been very painful. It was right around one of my incisions, so I passed it off as scar tissue blocking my knee and getting caught. I had an appointment with my surgeon two days ago, and it turns out that it’s probably not scar tissue, and he thinks I re-tore my meniscus. 

I only just scheduled another MRI, so I have no idea whether or not it is torn, but I can’t help but feel the worst outcome is going to happen. The pain does not feel normal, and it feels like I’m going backwards. I do not want to get surgery again, when I’m already almost back to normal. I feel like every time I get back up something bad happens and I go back to square one. If I got the surgery again, I’d have to be on crutches for 6 more weeks again, and go through all the same stuff in PT. 

I obviously want my knee to get better so that I can be active again, because that’s my only real way of coping with stress and making me happy. It just sucks that I can’t do the things that make me feel better, so I’m spiraling downward. I know this is just temporary, but there’s also the possibility that I’ll never be able to play tennis, run, or do other things again. And that thought just kills me and I don’t know what I would do if that happened. I also don’t know how to lose weight when I can’t do anything active, and because I’m gaining weight, I feel like shit about myself all the time. I’m not suicidal and I could never do that to my family, but I can’t help thinking about how easy it would’ve been to just die in the car crash.",My Life Sucks,t3_gspmwr,0

depression,"I often ask my friends who are struggling with depression and anxiety: ""Are you getting stronger?""

A response I often get is, ""Yes… but…"" - and that's where I proceed to cut them off.

When you're going through mental health, it's often easy to forget just how far you've come. How much you've made an effort to face the day despite your personal fabric feeling disintegrated due to the crippling effects of mental issues. There are no buts. Are you getting stronger? Yes. Take that as a win.

Give yourself credit where credit is due. It's so easy to desire to be in a better place than where we are today. It's dangerously futile to keep chasing a goal that continues to get further and further away from you. Feeling a tad anxious about that? Don't be - the only reason a goal is getting further and further away is because you're getting stronger and stronger. Day by day. As you get stronger, it is only natural for your desired baseline to be further away. And plus, this gives you more room to continue to grow into a better individual that you have the capacity to become.

It's hard, don't get me wrong. And yes, cutting off people before they continue on with their ""Yes… but…."" is quite harsh but I truly do mean this from a good place. I want us to recognise that saying yes to getting stronger is a win. That's it. That's all you can ask for, perhaps at this stage in your progress.

Give yourself some time, give yourself some admiration for your audacity to have the courage to face the day. Inheriting whatever mental demons within us aren't something that we asked for. They're the cards that we've been dealt and now we're just doing our best to play the best strategy possible.

I'm wanting to feel those feelings again, and feel the love again from him that I know is there but I push away, I push him away, but he doesn't plan on leaving me no matter what, he's committed to staying by my side and supporting forever which is a comfort but I feel like I'll be burdening him, he could find someone better who could actually show him all the love he deserves. I love him but god it's so hard to feel it or even try to create things to show him I love him, I've been trying to crochet and cross stitch with the intention of giving them as gifts to him but everytime I try to continue with them, I just wonder like what's the point? I'm just so frustrated with all of this. I'm happy and my true exuberant self when he's with me physically but when we are apart, I crumble back down to this sad and messy lump I don't want to be anymore...

So much has happened over sophomore year even though it was cut short and I couldn’t help but to cry because I feel that I have already lost my favorite part of myself which was my innocence.

That’s all happened over sophomore year and just now reflecting on it has only made me cry because I’m not a kid anymore. And I feel that if I don’t get the job that I want, or don’t go to college then I will be a failure to my parents even though I know they love me. And looking back at my childhood there are so many things that I regret doing, like rejecting spending time with my family to play video games or being mean to my family.

Not to be egotistical but I’ve been way too overly empathetic and distressed about societal/global issues and inequality that led to extreme burnout/depression/depersonalization and OCD last year. 

Learning that people who are selfish and don’t consider others have better mental health (to some extent, obviously.) hate platitudes/generalizations/close mindedness so much, they’re huge triggers. So I really don’t mean to generalize about selfishness. Nothing is black and white and experience is SO varied.

depression,"A lot of people have used that phrase to define depression. And in my case it’s especially true. 

I have had a lot of adverse situations in my past. I was sexually exploited when I was around six. I lost my best friend when I was around thirteen. My father was diagnosed with cancer at around the same time. 

After a few years, when I was sixteen, something magical happened to me. I found another friend. A girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever known. Eventually, I developed feelings for her. And she did too. Problem is, her parents were...conservative. They didn’t like the idea of romance. So, they barred me from her. Now, she is deathly scared if she receives even a text from me.

I miss her a lot. A few months ago, I started seeing a therapist. Doc said ‘She was a plug for your overflowing emotions. Now that she’s gone, your mind is in the void again.’

What do I miss? Kissing her. Holding her as near to me as possible. Laughing with her over things. Talking about philosophy, and then immediately shifting the topic to The Office.

I never did half of those things, but I still miss them. I think that’s what they mean by ‘homesick for a place that never existed in the first place’.",‘Homesick for a place that doesn’t exist.’,t3_gsf6s8,0

depression,"Um hi. I'm kinda new to Reddit, and this is actually my first post so I hope I'm doing this right. I'm sorry in advance if this post turns out to be me being dramatic. So, I'm a 14 years old girl and I was born in China and moved to the US at age 3. I'm a divorce child, and I haven't seen my biological father in years, and I'm fine with that. But because of that, I've used to go to therapy for 9 years old. I've stopped about 2 years ago. So from the beginning, I've been used to my parents yelling and stuff. Because of this, I have also moved to 7 different schools and 5 different times. After the divorce, I saw my dad kick my mom after showing up to her workspace. They've called the police on each other twice. They really hated each other, and I started to hate my dad more and more since he would always subtlely tell me to hurt my mom. Once I was in a Chinese New Year Festival with him and he bought me a confetti cannon. I pointed out there was a warning label to not point it at a person's face, and when we got home, he told me to shoot it at my mom. I did not. Soon, my mom met and was engaged to another man (let's call him Dan) and for the first few years moving in with him, he was awesome. We were an actual family. Of course, there were bad days, but it was light and things were always resolved quickly. I haven't heard of my biological father for a long time, and I was finally locked down in a school where I had a group of awesome friends. I was still pretty young, so I was really happy. But then things started to change. My parents decided they wanted a baby, which was awesome and I got a baby brother. He's really cute, but I think me and him, as well as the pressure of debt, stressed both our parents to change. We moved to another state away from my first ever real friends and they told me to suck it up and make new ones. I was in 6th grade at this time. This was one of the harder times for me. I became sadder, and my parent grew more irritated with me. I still don't know what happened, but I guess it was my fault for it. Soon, I got into more fights with my parents and started to just stay in my room. I feel like my mom was always stricter and less emotional than others. She always told me ""crying is for losers"" so she would always get mad at me for crying. Dan didn't really help me and often did nothing. I couldn't even cry in my room because my mom would say she would hit me if I didn't shut up. Me and my mom would fight about even the littlest things. Some examples are:

\- On multiple occasions, when I'm feeling extra down and my mom said, ""What's wrong with you?"" in a cold tone and tell me there's nothing to be sad about.

\-Said I was ugly many times because I was self-conscious of my looks.

\-Said I walked like a duck and like a man

\-Recently I wanted bangs and asked my mom about it, and she said I would look ugly and disgusting with them. Then she decides to cut my hair and when I asked bangs again, she cut a big chunk of my front hair. It was terrible and I was crying saying how I was going to get bullied in school. She laughed in front of me when I said I was going to get bullied.

\-Curse at me all the time on the simplest mistakes. If I accidentally spill juice, she will call me a fucking asshole and stupid. Those are just some of the words she would say. To this day, there hasn't been a day where I wasn't cursed at.

\-When I started cutting myself, my mom screamed and cursed at me, threatening she was going to send me to a madhouse multiple times.

\-Once I had a suicidal panic attack, and I was on the floor crying with a knife. She started yelling at me, screaming ""fuck you!"" When I told her I wanted to kill myself, she said ""Do it! Fucking do it! Go kill yourself!"" and stormed upstairs leaving me alone crying. This stuck with me.

\-When I asked my mom to be more compassionate and that she was hurting my feelings, she gave me the silent treatment for multiple days.

\-Multiple times when she was mad at me and I was crying, she curved her hands out like she wanted to choke me and said ""I want to kill you right now"".

\-Once she hit me with a wooden comb on the leg, leaving a mark.

\-She told me I was ""just like my father ""so many times, knowing that I knew she hated him. Also threatened me that she would send me back to his house(which was in another state).

\-Insulted me a lot. ""You're a fucking disgrace"", ""You asshole""

\-Told me multiple times that I made her want to kill herself and I was the reason she was going to die young.(this also stuck to me)

\-Laughed and rejected my plea for another therapist saying I was fine

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some I could think of right now. I really don't if it is my fault they're like this because they blame me for it. She gets mad easily. Yesterday, I asked if I could make ice cream sandwiches, and she just glared at me and said: ""are you fucking kidding me?"" My baby brother was with her a wanted to make them when I mention it, and my mom said that I was brainwashing him into doing what I wanted. She gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the day, She just ignored me and ignored my existence basically.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to Dan, my step-dad.  Now for this, I don't know if it's true, but I feel like he likes my baby brother more since he is actually his son. He's 5 now and a little devil lol, but we have good times together. I know he's just 5, but sometimes I just feel like Dan blames me for everything and never my brother. Here's what I mean:

\-My parent overly spoils him. I guess this is me being jealous, but my little bro thinks he could do whatever he wants. He shoots me with his nerf guns at close ranges, kicks me, and once, he even bit me so hard, he almost ripped my skin off. Whenever I complain about him to my parents, they would only say ""He's a baby, of course, he will do that. Your 13/14 years old, suck it up."" But the thing is, when my bro does the same thing to my parents, they will go beserk. Start cursing him out too and put him in time out. If he did the same to me, they would tell me I was a baby.

\-Dan would assume and blame me for things I haven't done. Once I was with my bro, and he got hurt because he watching where he was going and hit his head, and start crying. Dan would automatically assume that I hit him it something and yell ""Get the fuck away"" or ""Did you fucking hit him, you dumbass?""

\-Sometimes I would joke around or ask my parents a question only to have them call me stupid or tell me to shut up. That's why I never really talk to them about stuff.

\-His nicknames for me is ""knucklehead"", ""scumbag"", or ""dummy"".

\-When I say to him I was emotionally stressed and upset, he would say ""Oh grow the fuck up"".

\-Both my parents curse at me so much that my now 5-year-old brother starts calling me a ""stupid ass"" and my parent would laugh with him. 

\-Little mistakes that I did would end up me getting yelled at for being stupid and useless.

  
Again these are just some of the things I can remember off the bat. And although I'm mostly the one they are angry at, they sometimes curse and yell at my brother too. Another thing is if my parents are mad at my brother, they would be mad at me too even though I did nothing wrong. BUT if they were mad at me, they would not be mad at my brother. I know they talk behind my back, I'm not stupid. When I'm in my room after dinner, sometimes I can hear them talk about me and laugh. They're also not that supportive of my hobbies. I'm learning Korean, Japanese, and Chinese as a hobby, and they both tell me its stupid even though they know I'm so passionate about it. They judge my friends even though my friends are more compassionate than them. When I tell them that, they say that family is more important. Once, I got money for Christmas, and I decided to spend my gift card on amazon, my mom wouldn't stop complaining about me wasting my money and said that she wouldn't provide for me anymore and to buy my own stuff. (Note I was 13 with no job or allowance). For my grades, my parents weren't happy when I got a 91% average for ELA. 

My parents aren't the worst parents. They buy me stuff and provide for me and make delicious food for the family. But I wouldn't call them the best, either. Honestly, I'm scared of them to the point I'm kinda paranoid even when I'm not around them. I've memorized and learned their footstep sounds and how hard they stomp to decipher if they're mad or not. At school, I'm always scared of going homes because occasionally my mom would barge into my room for no reason when I'm away and always find something she didn't like. Even, when I'm hanging out with friends, I'm always at a lookout for a red Mazda car because I'm scared it could be my parent. I'm also scared of loud noises like a hairdryer or vacuum, but I don't know if it was because of them. When I'm with my friends, I'm always scared I did something wrong and that they actually didn't want to be my friends and were fake. When my parent calls me to them, I'm always scared if I did something wrong. 

When I see TV shows, movies, or videos of families, they always look happy and nice. They joke around, hug, and say I love you to each other a lot. My family never does that. But I don't know. Am I being dramatic? Is this normal for families or not? Am I the cause of this? Please help me. I really don't know what's right or wrong here or if I'm being whiny and sensitive to this. It's gotten to the point where I don't know if I'm actually depressed and anxious or looking for attention. Am I the bad one here? 

Thank you for reading all of this and I understand if I'm the problem here. I just really wanted to get it all out and find out the truth. Please help me, I really want to know if this is normal and what to do. Again, sorry for making this long, and I appreciate any advice from you guys. Thank you again.",Please help me!

But then I can’t make myself do it. I tell myself that if I just try a little and work to improve my portfolio I’ll be able to find a job, and then I can move on and be happy again. But I just play video games instead.

depression,"So I made some bad choices and lived real fast during my late teens/early 20s because of alcohol and general youthful stupidity. I honestly didn't think I'd make it to 30. During my rehab and throughout the last 4-5 years I've fixated on this ""home"" idea. I want to have somewhere that's mine: a garden to plant my plants in, and where my cat can go outside and run around. I just don't get paid enough, my wife doesn't either. 

We decided to not have kids because neither of us have ever made enough money to realistically afford the out of pocket expenses that come with raising children. Among many other reasons: (the world generally going to shit also seemed unethical). 

So the house is really important. It would be a constant project, something that we can make our own, and grow in. Instead of throwing away thousands of dollars a month in rent for nothing to some jerk landlord who doesn't give a shit if the pipes leak all the time, or overcharges for parking. 

But it hit me today that just when we might be able to save some money: the economy tanks, one of us gets laid off, we need to pay for my medical treatments (epilepsy and melanoma yay) or something else. We just won't ever be able to.

It took 10 years for me to save $4000... I'm almost 32 and I hate what my life is.

depression,"Hello, im new to this subreddit, so i am sorry if anything I say doesn't belong here, but I didn't know somewhere else to post this.

I have had therapy for a year and a half or something, but it was like one appointment every 4 weeks until I was transferred to another therapist where I had an appointment every week. I went to the first therapist, because of self-harm and when I finally had the guts to tell my mother about it, she suggested I see one, I was fine with it. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, at that point I had been cutting for over a year (it isn't that long, i know), but one of the reasons I was cutting was because I was so lonely and it made me feel much worse than I already was. But by the time he had diagnosed me and transferred me to another therapist I had found new friends, I didn't have any friends for years before that, so it was a huge change in my life for me. I started going outside and I felt better for the first time in a long time, so after a few weeks with the new therapist I wanted to stop the therapy.

One of the main reasons was because I didn't want to drive almost an hour every week to go to therapy when I could've been outside with friends, but the main reason was because she brought up alcohol and it made too uncomfortable (I had my first ever drink when I was 11, but i only started to drink regularly when I was 13 or 14), I didn't realize it at the time though. I did a last test, she told me my results indicate I should continue therapy, but if I really wanted to stop I could.

That was about one and a half years ago, I have been better in general, but the last 6 months espacially my depressive episodes have been getting worse again and I think I have also developed a serious alcohol problem in the last two years (at least I think I drink too much and every online test told I'm at a dangerous level of alcohol consumption). I am pretty sure that I drink a lot, because of depression and the drinking then also causes depressive episodes.

I have been thinking about going back to a therapist, but I am not 18 yet, so I think I would have to tell my parents one way or another, but I really do not want to have to tell my mother something like that again. The last time the look on her face devastated me and I really don't want to cause her any pain and I don't want her to worry too much about me.

Should I just wait till I am 18 to go to a therapist on my own? Should I just go now without telling my parents? Or do you have another idea?

depression,"My life has been a constant rollercoaster. I feel that most of my life has been failures, missteps, ""what I should've and could've done"", and a lack of positivity and joy. Now, I'm to the point where almost nothing is enjoyable. I feel so hollow and stripped to the core. I'm tired all the time. I move so slowly that my chest hurts or my breathing fluctuates suddenly time to time. I gave my heart to everyone I've known, only to be betrayed and emotionally abused. The only one I can seek refuge to is my boyfriend. However, I feel so much guilt putting all of my emotional burdens on him.

Recently, I left my band because of toxic relations with my drummer. I was in that band for 5 years, all the hard work I invested and hoped for, only to end violently. I had a teaching job, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought. I taught music for the first year, but the shortcomings of the US education system put me in the bottom of the barrel. I worked in public areas or shared classrooms, was promised to have enough supplies to teach but barely made my own materials, angered students in that I couldn't provide practical musical instruments, and was terminated by my school district. They didn't mention why, but my assumption is that I was not fit as a practical teacher working in their conditional settings.

My parents are very emotionally and verbally abusive. They assumed that some of my behaviors was because of the people I hanged out with or that my issues stemmed from not listening to my parents. In reality, I did nothing wrong. They're the ones that guided me to do teaching because they don't believe in my talents as a musician in a band. Even when I'm terminated, they told me to go back in working in education, no matter how much money it will take. To be honest, I'm too burned out to go back to school, and my experience as a teacher was so terrible that I do not want to pursue it anymore. Also, for years, I have so much resentment towards my parents, to the point where I can't even tell them I love them. They are cold, insensitive, and unloving people. I got more affection from crying with a pillow than I ever would from them.

At this moment, I share a room with my boyfriend in a house. It is crowded and full of bugs but it's doable for now. I am unemployed and seeking musical opportunities. My relations with my friends are so chaotic and full of drama that I erased all of my social media. I'm planning to change my phone number and fall out of existence. From my family, friends, and enemies. I'm planning to start over with a new identity and leave everything behind. I want to marry my boyfriend someday, and I hope it will be better.

He is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. I love listening to him. I love that he speaks multiple languages. I love hearing him talk to his employees in these various languages, it makes me so hot. He's well bred, educated, comes from a good family, makes good money, built his beautiful home and he wanted me. I couldn't have imagined a more fake life for myself.

We talk and text everyday for months. Plan for me to come visit in June. I start to notice a change in the last week or so. Our relationship feels more friendly then flirty. I catch him recapping his weekend and his wife comes up more often. He keeps talking about a show I should watch. He says ""We watch it every night"". He never spent time with ""we"" at night. So, because I care, I say ""I think we should do this. I think we should cancel our trip and I think we should consider being friends. I think you're falling back in love with your wife and marriage is going well. That's a good thing. I don't want you to feel like you need to carry on with me unnecessarily."" He paused and then said he's been really torn. I told him not to feel bad for having an improved marriage.

I already knew why it improved, I wanted to know if he knew why. So I asked him. He said he thought she had been seeing someone. I laughed and said ""No, that's not why."" So he asked me why I thought so. I told him for the last several months he's had an outlet to talk to about things he can't with her or anyone else really because his family is so tight knit. So he gets all this off his chest and when he gets home, he's a much nicer, more relaxed, happier version of himself. That's why she likes him more and is paying him more attention. I told him to waste no time and seize the moment to be a good husband. Buy her flowers, kiss her on the cheek and tell her you love her.

After we hung up. I cried. I cried so hard. I wanted him to bring me flowers, kiss me on the cheek and tell me he loved me. I told him what I wanted. And she's going to get it. Never in a million years did I think my attempt at having this affair, just this one little thing for myself, would backfire and improve my cheaters marriage.

When I was in high school my mom passed away of cancer, that was 9 years ago so that doesn’t bother me the way it used to, time heals yada yada. The one thing that has come from that is that I crave affection, I feel empty when I’m single which is probably either normal or weird, I don’t know. 3 years ago a relationship I valued ended because we started to grow and think about what was next, I wanted a family she didn’t. That sucked but neither of us would be happy so it was for the best. I proceeded to enjoy the freedoms of being single and casually dated off and on no big deal but then 2019 happened.

 I worked with a girl named A she was cool and I really enjoyed her company so we started hanging out outside of work, I found out she gave up her baby for adoption and I respected that ( I already knew cause workplace drama when a pregnant lady goes missing and comes back not talking about her baby you know something must have happened.) I took it slow, did the right things, but she chose to sleep with another dude in a different department like I wouldn’t find out and she tried to get me fired when I called her out for cheating (I’m well liked so she had 0 shot at succeeding. In a hilarious plot twist, she got hit by a forklift and I was THE ONLY witness so I lied and said she walked out in front of the guy. When she got sent out for a drug test she found out she was pregnant again with the other dude. Eventually she quit when the whole department turned on her for being a hoe.) 

I met another girl at work during this time and her name was K. I was hurt by A’s actions and I really let me guard down with K, I let her in and she was classy, smart, and I genuinely trusted her, I started to fall for her but Then she broke up with me with this classic line that really bothers me, “You didn’t do anything, I’m the asshole, you’re a great guy, I’m sorry.” I found out she left me for her ex. I’m broken, I was screwed over twice, I feel robbed, I didn’t do anything to either of them but it was totally okay to rip my heart out like I didn’t even matter. I found out through K’s mom’s friend at work that K’s dad passed away and I reached out cause even though she doesn’t care about me, I don’t want her to quit schooling or her sister to go off the deep end. It felt like the right thing to do. Why do I give a shit about people who gave 0 about me? I don’t expect a response, why should she? It really hurts that even when you do the right things, treat people the way you want them to treat you and it all just gets spit back in your face. 

I just want the relationship that I had ripped out from under me but I don’t think there will ever be a next one. It feels like I’m just stuck here in this house alone, I have a roommate but they don’t get this feeling.

depression,"You know those days where you do everything you're supposed to do to take care of yourself and you're still miserable? You get up at a reasonable time, make yourself a nutritious breakfast, work out and try to convince yourself that you're having such a good day. And none of it works. Maybe for a few minutes at a time you manage to trick yourself into thinking you actually are in a good mood, because it feels like you should be. It feels like you deserve that emotional payoff, doesn't it? But for the majority of your day you feel like shit. You may feel like bursting into tears randomly, or go hours without feeling anything at all. You might be barely aware of what's going on in the world around you, or maybe you feel you are all too aware of it, to the point where it's uncomfortable. You might want to disappear, or feel as if you already have. You'll likely feel all of these things at least once throughout the day, so you'll start trying to fix it. You'll go on doing things that you typically enjoy very much in search of that contentment you know you deserve, and you'll find that the attempt only makes you more unhappy. Why? Why are you so depressed today when you did everything you could to feel normal? There is no logical reason for your sudden drop in mood, and that's okay. Even if you were steadily holding your own against your depression for WEEKS leading up to this, what you're going through today is hard but it's going to be okay. No progress was lost today. No harm was done today. Your depression won the battle, but you're going to win the war. Some days you can try everything under the sun to feel good and none of it will bring you any solace.

jump to 2017: I haven't been able to find work, get unemployment, get on disability, or anything. I then started chatting with lonely people who were looking for someone to be basically their live-in mommy. I moved in with this guy and did the cooking and cleaning, making his home clean and neat and treating him like a king in his castle. Then he got a tall girlfriend who decided she didn't like me and she beat me nearly to death and tried to rip my clothes off. That was the fourth assault of my life. I moved out of there.

2018: Then I found a new guy to move in with, and things were fine, until only a few months later there is a fire that takes everything I ever owned. My most valuable possessions, basically my life savings, were wiped out. I got 500 bucks for it, nothing more.

2019: I find another guy to move in with, but he grows tired of me and only sees me as a friend. He lets me stay with him for a whole year and here I am now, well past my welcome. I have been looking for somewhere new to go since then, but all the people I have talked to so far have flaked out. I guess I'm just too old and ugly now.

Even when I’m “happy” I look at fucking fruit and wonder how many apple seeds it would take to kill me (if you didn’t know there’s cyanide in apple seeds). I constantly mistake dopamine and serotonin rushes for being happy when really it’s quite rare that I’m ever truly happy.

I was terrified I would never be able to find my way home because it had been hours after I left and it was getting dark. When I realized I was back on track to getting home I cried tears of joy.

I am in high school have limited friends and all i do is sit home everyday feeling worthless . I was born with a defect where my chest is sicken and i am extremely skinny and very self conscious . I try to work out but have not seen any progress for the past year.  My best friend (I don’t know if he considers me as his prob doesn’t )  is always out doing stuff with his girlfriend and acts like he never has time 4 me which makes me feel worthless and invisible . My friend group that is mostly made up of mutual friends of one friend that i had back in middle school is always making plans without me and it leaves me sad and alone all day. I often have mental breakdowns where i get extremely sad and cry or sometimes a combination of mad and sad. I just want to be happy . I just want somebody to ask me how my day went or make plans with me (is that too much to ask for?) I have turned to drugs (only weed) and alcohol to solve my problems and my relationship with family members has gotten so bad that i am scared to talk to them about anything let alone my depression. It feels like i am living in hell and not a day passes without me feeling like i want to end it all.

depression,"I (f21) have had major depression for about 6 years now.  Currently my treatment consists of medications (bupropion, sertraline, and adderall) and therapy. It has been the first really successful treatment plan that I’ve been on. 

In the past 2-ish years, my period has been making my depression worse. The plan I am on right now my depression is at the lowest it’s been in years. But a couple days before my period, I start to get the lack of energy, oversleeping, extreme irritability, no interest in anything, numb feeling. It’s not the worst I’ve experienced but it’s enough to make me extremely unproductive/not functioning. There was a time when I didn’t have access to medication and that was a nightmare, the week of my period I would be sobbing the whole time, anything people would say would piss me off, a lot of pent up energy and emotion that didn’t have a place to go, it was some of the worst of my mental illness. 

I wanted to know if anything has help y’all if you’ve been through a similar situation?

I wanted all of it to end so I agreed to pay the compensation because I just don't have the mental capacity to go with the court case anymore. 

I got a job overseas which pays me triple than what I was earning back home so I decided to pack everything and go on a new adventure. But I know part of me just wanted to run away from everything.

depression,"This isn't a post aimed at getting anyone to sympathize with me, but moreso me seeking answers of some sort.

It's no secret at this point that our society is home to an increasingly suicidal population. And honestly, it's not hard to see why. Society and life in general is goddamn stressful and it's stopped being enjoyable a loooong time ago. We get out of our bed because it's routine, not because we eagerly await what goodies those gold-hearted politicians and corporates have in store for us. Society has stopped being enjoyable for me as a result of this. The highs don't outweigh the lows and I'm tired of constantly competing so hard in something I barely care about anymore.

This was a sentiment that a friend of mine in 2018 used to have. He was tired of being stuck in the same societal cycle he loathed so much and he made it no secret with me. At one point he told me that he was disowned by his family because he didn't want to share their religion and wanted to let me know, in case he needed a place to crash out at because the possibility of him getting kicked out was very real. He mentioned having suicidal thoughts and I went through the usual process of trying to talk him out of it. Then, after a bit of back and forth, he shared this somewhat enigmatic story that I would remember two years later. (Note: the quote below is somewhat paraphrased as I don't remember exactly what happened).

(By the way, DBD is short for Dead by Daylight, a video game this guy used to enjoy)

&gt;""I used to play DBD with 3 other people who really wanted me around to play the game with them. It was fun at first, but eventually I got tired of DBD. I got tired of its monotony, I got tired of the idiotic decisions the people in charge kept making, I got tired of the constant issues that plague the game, and I got tired of the toxicity and how hateful the community has gotten. I even got tired of my team to an extent as they expected more and more out of me. The game wasn't fun for me anymore.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I told my group I was leaving. I didn't want to play anymore. I wanted to leave that toxic environment and I wanted to leave the game I stopped enjoying.  
&gt;  
&gt;They tried to get me to stay. They told me that there was still so much to await in DBD, that it was too early in the game for him to leave, that they promised it would get better in the future. It didn't matter. I didn't care what was in store for the future, I just plain and simple stopped enjoying the game. When that didn't work, they took on a slightly more vitrolic tone and said that he was selfish for leaving, that he was intruding their happiness by taking an action that would benefit him and him alone, and that regardless of his enjoyment, that he should stick around so he could make others happy.  
&gt;  
&gt;It definitely made me feel guilty. If they were trying to guilt-trip me, they definitely succeeded. It made the decision harder to make. Eventually though, I told them this. If you can't play the game without me, you shouldn't have me. This dependence on me you have is unhealthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know if my selfishness was warranted there. Maybe I should have stuck around as they asked. Maybe I should stop caring about my own happiness as they wanted me to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;So that's why question here is, am I the asshole for supposedly being selfish as they claimed, for prioritizing my own happiness over theirs? And if so, do you think I am obligated to stick around in something I clearly don't enjoy simply because other people demand it? Do you think I'm obligated to participate in something I hate simply because other people demand it?""

I didn't understand. I told him, ""I still don't see what this has to do with your current situation."" (I really wasn't very bright back in the day.)

He gave me an inscrutable expression, then said, ""Maybe one day you will.""

I haven't heard from him since. I think he might be in the Canadian armed forces, but I can't be sure. He hasn't responded to any attempts to communicate with him.

This was two weeks before graduation, in 2018. Now two years later, in 2020, I'm finding myself in a similarly hopeless situation, where I too am running out of reasons to keep persevering for something I hate so goddamn much.

I'm not going to get into it. This isn't the post for that, it's largely irrelevant to the purpose of this post. I will say, though, that the day has indeed come where I now understand what my friend was talking about. I now understand why my friend told me all that.

And I already know the whole song and dance with this whole shtick. How suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem (as if society being incredibly exploitative and hateful is a ""temporary problem"", as if me getting tired of participating in said exploitative society is a ""temporary problem"", and as if that's somehow a bad thing in the first place), how I'm apparently selfish for even considering it (but isn't it selfish to demand people to participate in something they hate for the pleasure of others?), how apparently it ""gets better"" (what if such a promise doesn't change the fact that I no longer want to participate anyways?) and how apparently I'm an awful person for trying to supposedly justify suicide or even thinking about it in the first place. Hell is where I belong I guess, but isn't that a fitting place for someone as hopelessly selfish as I am? It's not much different from Earth. No better therapy for suicidal tendencies than Hell I suppose.

So where am I going with this? What's the point of this entire post? Well, it's mainly for me to ask this question.

If someone gets sick of participating in society and life, then why should we try to convince them or force them to stick around? Why should we try to force someone to participate in something if they very clearly don't enjoy it?

If that's the way they want to carry out their life, I'm not their mother. I can't force them to act a certain way just because I think I have the authority to tell them what to do. No one has that the authority to tell him how to manage his life except for him and him alone.

So why are we so adamant about this? If someone got sick of participating in something, why do we keep trying to force them to stick around anyways?",Searching for Answers,t3_gsk571,0

depression,"I work for a bpo company and recently, we got reprofiled because my original account laid off employees (including me). We are offered by the company to transfer to a different account, but it can only accommodate work from home setup.

The catch is I'm only bedspacing at an apartment, and the company will have to provide a PC for work. I don't have space to lug the machine, the stairs are my only option for me to set up. I also need to take calls during graveyard shift when all my housemates are asleep. My landlady refused my request for this.

I offered to work onsite, risk going out and go to work so I can prevent inconveniencing my housemates, but the account is not open with the idea.

I'm desperate, anxious and confused. I thought this year would be better, since I don't have a job last year. I worked hard to obtain my job now but because of the pandemic and these events, I don't know how to proceed.

I feel guilty that I didn't accept my old account's offer to work onsite during the first few weeks of lockdown here in our country. My thinking before is that I can't risk going out even though I get fully paid salary, because it's still not enough to cover medical expenses if I will be admitted to the hospital if ever I'll be infected with the virus.

depression,"*** I originally posted this on another group, but I realize it was the wrong group. Sorry if this is the second time you see this... ***

First, I want to say, I think there are plenty of teenagers and other young people on this forum who are hurting badly because of external life circumstances or not having found their way in life yet. If that is you, obviously you should seek help without delay, as far as professional counselling, medication, etc. This post is not directed at these people, aware as I am of their very real current struggle.

I believe there is depression, and then there is Depression with a big ""D"". To society at large, depression being a fairly new subject that is being talked about, it's always just ""depression"". But it's like heart disease: it can go from being minor with small, reversible consequences to being permanent, incurable, and life-threatening.

I am 33 years old (man). Relatively speaking, I have a lot of the things people could want in life. I work in health, I make very decent money, I am over 6 feet, rather good looking, I am athletic and talented at many sports, I am trilingual, and I have a supportive family.

And yet, I suffer immensely. For twenty years, I've struggled with low self-esteem, social anxiety, loneliness (friendship-wise and romantic-wise, even though I have a few friends), crippling depression, and other anxiety-related illnesses. Mental illness is the story of my life. Over the years, I have seen plenty of health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers), taken countless types of medications (bupropion, sertraline, prozac, lamotrigine, quetiapine, Ritalin, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, brexpiprazole...), followed therapies (CBT), read countless self-help books, and consulted support groups. I generally have an ideal lifestyle (exercise, great eating habits, good sleep, meditate, mindfulness). I have done EVERYTHING that is recommended for someone in my situation. If that's not your case, I apologize but you have absolutely no business considering suicide as an option.

And at this point in time, after all these years, I find myself EXACTLY where I started. As a matter of fact, things are only deteriorating as time passes for me. My suffering is only intensifying, and my desire to end it is only growing larger.

So this brings me to the point of my post : are there other people in the same boat, that feel that there is indeed a time, when you have exhausted your options, when ending it can really be considered acceptable and reasonable? We often hear people say, ""there is hope"", or ""things will get better"". Really? Have you felt like dying for two decades, went to see every possible ressource out there, and still have not found inner peace? I suspect that, as I said, people tend to put all ""depressions"" in the same basket. Not taking anything away from someone with post partum depression or post-divorce depression or similar ailments, but these can be attributed to a root cause around which you can work. In my case, I have spent years trying to make sense of my depression, trying to find a cause, but I am at a loss.

I truly believe, now, that there are some people, such as myself, that can never be saved. We have depression with a big ""D"". There is no identifiable ""cause"" to explain the empty feeling inside. There is no reason for the hopelessness. The darkness just ""is"". Medical professionals do not understand it and are simply powerless over it. I truly believe there are two choices for people like us : to end it now and alleviate the suffering, or to live in sadness and pain for the rest of our lives.

I am scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy soon, but I'm not sure I'm going to go. I fear that this treatment will simply be one more added to the long list of disappointments I have endured seeking help over the years.

I believe that things simply are as they are. Some people are simply given bad cards to play with in this life. And to me, the worst type of cards to be dealt, by far, are the faulty brain cards. The ""incapable of happiness"" cards. It is as it is and, frighteningly, my very much rational and scientific logic is pushing me closer and closer to the only ""effective"" treatment that I can see working to destroy my illness, and thus end my suffering...

Anybody else in this boat? Thoughts? Does anybody else think that, indeed, there is a time when the most reasonable, thought-out option could in fact be to end it? Can society ever understand this, understand the limit of science and ""accept"" someone doing the ""unacceptable""?

depression,"So this might be long, and for that I apologize. Let me begin by giving the briefest overview of the problems that bring me here today:

* From ages 3-8 I was very heavily abused in literally any way you want to imagine by my mother.
* Started living with my Dad when I was about 10, he passed away in his sleep when I was 11, and I was the one who found the body.
* Throughout my teen years, I bounced around between schools very often due to getting into too many fights/being bullied/""not being the right fit"", along with being homeless off and on.
* At 15, I met a girl that I fell in love with very deeply. When I was 19, she passed away while pregnant with my child.
* And finally, when I was 20, maybe 21, I met another girl who I, again, fell in love with very deeply, and dated her on and off for roughly 9 years, the relationship recently having been permanently ended as it had been very abusive for the last few years, and she did some stuff that I will SLIGHTLY elaborate on later that hurt me very deeply, and changed the way I saw her irrecoverably.

Due to the above factors, I have lived with depression for as long as I can remember, was diagnosed wth schizo-effective disorder at 14, and I'm terrified that I have Dissociative Fugue Disorder due to some very concerning instances of lost time/people saying I'm doing/saying shit and don't remember. But according to my ex, I'm just a liar who's not half as good as half the other men she's been with. So It's probably just that.

Not counting online friends/friends who I don't really keep in touch with, I have two friends. Just two. And those two friends are becoming more and more distant due to their own problems and struggles that they have to deal with, of which I hold no grudge or ill feelings. My relationship with my family is failing due to the fact that I live on social security, and constantly need to ask them for financial help that they simply cannot continue to provide, especially during these times.

I don't leave my house unless it's to buy groceries/check my mail. I'm pretty certain that my smoking habit has begun to cause. Some sort of chronic lung issue of some sort, I genuinely haven't gone to check it out yet. And I'm also very quickly becoming an alcoholic, now that I have virtually no one to really talk to anymore and am confined to my own thoughts.

TL;DR - No matter how hard I look, how hard I try, I cannot find any decent reason to just. Keep trying. It has gotten to a point where I genuinely cannot see any good, logical reason to continue smacking my head against this wall that is apparently my life. I need help. I need something. Someone. Anything, anyone, just. SOMETHING. To hold on to. Because I swear, it's like I can feel myself slipping, and I still have enough of me left to care about the people who care enough to be sad if anything were to happen to me. And I'm really. Really. REALLY. Tired of making people I care about sad and hurt. I just don't know what else to do.

I have a loving family and friends, i dont have to worry about my future, im 20 and i have more money saved than the average american has student loan debt and next week is the last exam i have before i get my admission to go to a university. 

All doors in my life are wide open, but i dont care. I used to care about alot of things, everything was interesting, there was always something to look forward to. Now i dont look forward to anything anymore and all the things i used to enjoy have just become a way to distract myself, from the emptiness i feel when my head isnt busy trying to comprehend new information coming in.  
If its not a particular bad day i dont really notice it when im doing stuff, its the moments of silence that get me.

I used to strugle with the meaning of life in the past because ever since i can remember i always thought of life as meaningless. I didnt care about it when i was younger, but when i became older i looked for a way to get some meaning. I came to the conclusion that, yes nothing matters, but not really. Nothing matters unless you choose it to matter. Yes my emotions are just the chemicals in my brain but that part doesnt matter to me, what does matter is that they can make me feel good and so i want to do the things that make me feel good, if possible with the foresight of long term happiness.

But that source of meaning just doesnt cut it anymore, because its a very flawed system.  
What if i dont choose anything to matter? What if there isnt anything anymore that makes me feel good or happy? What if the thing that makes me happy is thinking about my own death?

The scariest part about imagining death is the amount of excitement i get from thinking about it. It gives me a sense of reliev and freedome, like nothing else does. Finally i wouldnt have to feel this anymore. I dont know how to put this feeling into words, its not just emptiness, it feels like my chest is being pressed on and theres a small constant stream of adrenaline that my body puts out, mixed with an extreme sense of apathy.

There is probably only one thing i care about and thats the people i love. If i didnt have them i would have already driven my car into a wall or off a cliff, sometimes i come close but I just cant bring myself to do it.

depression,"Hello,

I am a 30/F nurse in the NYC area, have been recently totally overwhelmed with the COVID-19 cases but it is getting better. However, ever since this nightmare started my depression, anxiety and mood has been so bad. I have dealt with a lot during this pandemic, and have watched many people die, including colleagues. Now I find myself in a constant state of anger, sorrow, fatigue and irritability. This is catered solely to my job. At work, I am constantly irritated by everyone except the patients and my fellow nurses. However, when I feel like I am being asked something by a hospital colleague, someone who was/is able to stay home or work from an iPad during the pandemic, like the social workers/dietitian and many speciality doctors like neurologists or psychiatrists, I am so frustrated. 
I feel us nurses were so abused during this crisis, stepping into rooms to hold up an iPad for these specialities and allowing mass exposure to ourselves,  while they of them were able to sit comfortably at home to do their job while putting me and my nurse colleagues at risk. In their notes they would write “to limit personal exposure to COVID19, this interview was done via iPad”. Yes, to limit your exposure and massively increase my own! We did not receive any hazard pay, only empty accolades from hospital staff who would not even come to the floors with these sick covid patients to support us in any way while we were drowning in mass death and chaos.

And now, even though our COVID count has dropped so dramatically and we are regaining a sense of normalcy, some/most of these same staffers are still are not coming in and expect us to do iPad interviews for them, or ask the patient questions for them, each time increasing our exposure/risk. 

My anger and depression over this makes me cry almost every day, and I can’t even sleep anymore. All I do is think about my dead patients who I grew so close to and my dead colleagues, and those who I feel made this so much worse by jeopardizing my health to make themselves safe.

depression,"Well, hi, first of all, sorry about my english.   
The reality is that i can't take all this anymore, my past is killing me, my present is making me cry, and my future scares a lot. I'm 22, I'm Argentinian, I'm a writer, and the quarantine is erasing me.

My problems began at the age of 10, more or less; in school. Almost all my classmates were awful. I live in a small town not too far from Buenos Aires, but it was enough to make people think like the 17th century.  
The little amount of friends i got where girls (I'm a boy), so, even when kids around 10 years old, that was cataloged as ""gay"". The boy must been with boy, the girls with girls. They started to laugh every day, every single of it. And on the days they did not, they left me alone. Anyone wanted to sit with me, talk to me, even touch me.  
At home, it was about all the same. My dad is and was male chauvinist, my mom didn't had much voice over the house, and I was the oldest brother. So, for this, anything was done with my ""school issue"", even the school doesn't care too much.

When I got to middle school everything went worse. I was 12, and I remember that year as one of the worst years of my life. The biggest problem reside in P.S. The subject was planned as girls with girls in a determined day and hour, and boys with boys in another day an hour. The start of teenage only made the problem worse. But this time, the P.S teacher participated in the whole thing. My classes always ended with me in tears. Every Tuesday and Thursday I arrive home crying, and only my mother was worried. My dad was limited to say: ""punch them! Don't let them feel you weak."", and things like that.  
My classmates used to cornered my on the breaks and ask me if I were a ""gay, or a super gay, o a little fucking passive gay"" and a lot of similar sentences. I couldn't do nothing. At that time I did not had the confidence or ""the muscles"" to defend myself. That also made me feel bad with myself.  
In the first and second year I lost almost all the friends I used to have. I was even more lonely than ever before. And the only place where I was the luck to made friends was the Xbox. I knew some Mexican guy around my age and, luckily, we become real good friends. I started to forget about my ""real world"". My purpose in living become on reaching home and turning on the Xbox so I could talk, smile and laugh with people I like. I lost interest in everything. I continued crying almost every day, but, for me, it was not a problem anymore, as long as, I had the Xbox.  
At the age of 14 I started reconsidering my sexuality. And I have the confidence to say, I'm very proud of myself in that aspect. Even on that environment, and surrendered with the people I were, I had the courage to assume I was and am gay. First, I told my Xbox friends about it, then a guy in school that was starting to be nice with me. And I regret it until today. He ""cheated"" on me. I told clearly to him please do not tell anybody; as so, the next day of school, every single kid there, everyone, knew. When they started to saw me entering by the door, all their eyes pointed at me. In that second, my life collapsed. I ran away from school, and I wait to the time passes to went back home.  
From that day, I started to feel fear. An intense fear. It scared me that my parents found out by someone else than myself. Because, I knew, it all, far to believing, might get worse. I decided, so, to tell them directly. And my god, it's a scene that make me cry even today. Both of them bombarded me with phrases that I don't think I could erase from my mind. My father went away after all of that. And then, the day after, he started to came every day, from almost a month, to my room to continuity say worse and worse thing about all the thing. He convinced me that I couldn't be gay, that it was wrong, that ""what would think the neighbours, my grandfathers, my classmates, my family..."". So then, he forces me to ""try with a woman"", because then, and only then, I could have the real security, if I was or not gay. He sent me, at the age of 15, with no one, but three prostitutes. And it was seemed that he won't stop until I said to him what was pretending to hear: ""Yes, dad, you were right, I'm heterosexual"". I take over three, and then, I say it.  
He smiled. And all stopped.  
On school I said an excuse that my father told me to say, and all stopped.  
But on the Xbox I was still me, on secret, but still me. Why on secret? Well, I said I was reconsidering what I already said, but maybe I were Bi.  
From there on, I force me to watch heterosexual porn, watch girls instead of boy. I was forcing myself on not being what I was, not searching what I like. And entered on a depression that anybody care. Because it wasn't important while I like girls instead of boys.

6 month later, my mom committed a try of suicide. By the magic of biology, she didn't died. But, for me, she did. Our relationship where improving over the years to now on, but it is not the same for me.  
But when all that happened, I exploded. I was not interested on living anymore, but I didn't know how to kill myself.  
So one day, in my grandfather's house, I found a gun. I put it on my mouth. I was alone. And couldn't do it. I left. I left and run, and the Xbox save me again, my friends were there, waiting for me. And smiled.

Time passed and I finished middle school.  
That where all started to become better. I went to Buenos Aire to do college, I met new people, I made friends, I left this ghost town, my family, my past, and everything; sadly, for only 8 hours a day.  
Was a wonderful year, a really good year. But, at the end, my father, who was paying my studies, stopped for no reason. And reality hit me again. I was with no clue for what to do next. I become an sad boy again, my happiness disappeared, and my town started to consume me again.  
At next year my mind made a switch. The loneliness and unhappiness force me to made a change: I get out of the closet once more. But I promised me that I will be what I wanted to be no matter what. And, so, I did. My father were divorced since the try of suicide of my mom, and I cut all connection with my father after what he did with my college studies. So I came out, and try to start a new life from there.

The year was 2017, and I had my first boyfriend. We didn't last much, but it was a nice experience. Also, was the first time I had -real- sex. And I enjoy it a lot. But then it all finished. I don't feel as sad I thought I would be. I felt lonely again. The Xbox was a thing of the past, and I didn't have friends at all.

So then, 2018 came. I started a new career by myself (this said, I didn't depend from anyone), and in April, I new someone else. And god... was the beginning of the end.  
I don't have enough words to describe that year, those feelings. It was something like a roller coaster. I started to ""break"" all my reprimed past with my new boyfriend. I started to compare my life to his and started to feel so bad. I made myself dependent of him. I made him my world, my motivation; my everything. He was younger. We loved each other so much, so well. But i was not happy as I would like. My self esteem was getting so low that I almost cry everyday. But with him I was extremely happy.  
And also, I were in Buenos Aires almost all days. I started to do the life I always wanted, to feel loved, happy, and free. I did almost all the things I always dream about, I had the routine I always fantasized. And I feel as loved as never.  
And then, it all fell. We ended in a troubled relationship, and te problem, believe it or not, wasn't much my fault. He lied to me with the basics, he refused to communicate, he lost interest, his circle was pressing him to left me. It happened at the end of the same year.  
I never felt more depressed in my life. All crashed at the same time. The past, the fantasy of infinite happiness, the lost of the only person I could say I loved, my self esteem become even lower. And I started to thought about suicide almost every day.  
I arrived at a point of no regression and started going, for the first time, to a psychologist. It helped. But not too much.

I reach 2019 crying, wanting to kill myself, to stop the pain my heart was taking. I tried to get hit by a train, I tried 3 times; couldn't do it. To all the things I was feeling, melancholia joined.  
And then, again on April, he came back. And I ran to him with no doubt. But things weren't the same. We finished again in 4 months. And all the same feelings crashed on me again. Luckily I was capable to make a few friends on college, so I didn't feel as lonely as before. A lot of me changed in that second half of the year.  
And in December, he appeared again, for the third time. We were back together again. ""This in the good one"" he told me. And it seems that it was true. I passed a happy summer, and, at all the time passed, my self esteem was solid again. Well, ""solid"". But way better than before. It was not the same again, but, for me, it was better than being alone in my town.

And then 2020. And with it, the quarantine. Sadly, we broke up again. He realised that he didn't want a relationship at all. He wasn't the boy I used to know, so I understand: i wasn't either happy as I used to be with him. We finished, and the melancholy started to rise again, the quarantine doesn't help, my loneliness doesn't help, my house doesn't help. I feel melancholy about 2018, not him. I feel melancholy about the happiness i experienced in that year, the freedom, the ""reconstruction"" it made on my life, my mind, and my heart. I've never felt as lonely as I feel now. And I don't know when I will be able to travel to Buenos Aires again.  
Finally, I always were a sexual person, I liked to much, I enjoy masturbation a lot, and since 2017, I enjoy sex a lot. 2018 made me discovered a lot, made me enjoy a lot. Is one of the thing I miss more about him in general. I was masturbating a lot on the last days, but my psychologist discovered, some days ago, I suffer (also) ""Post-coital tristesse"", so she recommended me to stop all sexual activity for as long as I can. She suggested that, in possible, I only have sex with a person I have confidence, she also asked me to stop masturbating. And, to be honest, it smashed me. Sex for me it was always a really nice thing, a way to give love, to someone or to myself.  
Now I'm asking if a want to be that kind of person. I have to desexualize every aspect of my life (my Post-coital tristesse is severe). I don't want that, I was thinking about finishing all again, I'm really depressed, melancholic, and with a lot of doubts about my future and my capabilities.

It seems that It never stops. The amount of things that, I feel, makes my life miserable, doesn't stops.  
I cried on every single word of this text, I try to cut my arm with a knife last night, and I couldn't stop regretting my life at a hole.

Sorry about this being so long, I just wanted to speak with someone.  
Love from Argentina.

depression,"Mid last year I was diagnosed with Psychotic Depression  This condition causes you to experience psychotic symptoms plus the sadness and hopelessness associated with depression. This means seeing, hearing, smelling, or believing things that aren’t real.

Thing is, after being diagnosed I still feel the thing that I thought was true, even now. After being diagnosed I suppressed everything and avoided telling anyone any details except my ex who I had told about the things I thought were true but no one confirmed it. 

I still believe it, but I was too stubborn to be hospitalized... so I had to pretend to be okay. I went crazy, homeless and had a few fall-outs with some family members before I was finally able to suppress everything enough to start studying this year and work over quarantine.

I'm able to focus on work and uni but one of the things that this experience has injured is my social skills. I don't trust anyone. I get anxiety when I talk to people. I don't have friends at work or uni. My speech is starting to worsen each day, I've noticed i slur my words since I barely talk anymore. I cry a lot after the day has ended and it's usually to do with the fact that I can't talk to people and I'm lonely af.

depression,"Ive been diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

I started taking Paxil when I was 18 for depression and anxiety. It both helped and destroyed different aspects of my life. I switched to Lexapro 20mg daily 10 years later and have been taking it ever since (10 years).

I also recently added Wellbutrin to the mix at 300mg daily. 

Thought my time with Paxil and Lexapro, I've experienced withdrawal symptoms like brain zaps, nausea, vertigo and diarrhea whenever I'd miss my dose for a few days.

I've tried to get off Paxil and Lexapro un the past, but wasn't successful. I became really agitated, I couldn't think or function well. I lost one job, quit another and ended a relationship during these times of trying to get off. The fallout of my behavior would result in depression, which led me back to taking the drug to gain some stability again.

During the recent lockdown, I haven't been able to get my meds as frequently as I once was able to. I'm still taking Wellbutrin, but I haven't taken Lexapro for about 2 weeks now.

The brain zaps, nausea, and diarrhea started a few days ago. Although, this time around, the agitation is minimal and manageable. I also feel less a lot less anxious then when I was on Lexapro. Another benefit I'm seeing is a clearer mind... For the past few days I've noticed I can focus and understand concepts much better than before.

I'm considering stopping Lexapro altogether, and sticking just with Wellbutrin, but I'm worried that I'll reach a point where my agitation becomes unmanageable, and I start sabotaging my life again. 

I think the addition of Wellbutrin this time around may be helping with the withdrawal from Lexapro, but I'm not certain.

I wanted to get the community's insight into this and maybe hear of any similar experiences the same cocktail of drugs or something similar.

depression,"  Suicide is hard to think about for so many reasons. The first one is, you never feel ready. There’s so many thoughts that come to mind and things to do or say before. Even when people try to talk you out of it, it doesn’t change anything. I’m so numb to everything, it all just feels so numb. I feel so rejected in so many ways. My father gave up on me ten years ago, my ex girlfriend doesn’t want anything to do with me, it feels like I’m a disappointment to my family after they found out about some of my issues, I feel like I’ve already thrown my life away because of my grades, I stopped caring about school, I just feel like I’m always in a room alone. Even at big events, it’s like looking out a window at happy people. The suicide hotline doesn’t really help. I spoke with a really nice lady though a while back on the hotline named April. I’ll never forget her, she really did seem to care, and relate to me. She offered to call me back days later but I never picked up the phone. A few months later, nothing. I regret not answering. Everyone else I’ve talked too on the hotline just said cliche things and didn’t help at all. I’ve tried to get help, I spoke with my old therapist and it just wasn’t helping. I felt like she didn’t understand as well as April did. I wish I could find someone who understands me. Everybody seems to be in a different reality than me. I feel like I’m in this world all by myself, that nobody truly cares. I wish I could go back in time and appreciate things more, to not take so much for granted. I love my friends and family. Sometimes it probably doesn’t seem like it but I think a lot. I’m always thinking about people. Suicide isn’t a natural thing that someone just thinks of one day, it’s something you think of for weeks, months or even years. You begin to make that thought more comfortable, until it starts to not feel as scary. You get the fear out of the way so that you can go through with it. You begin to realize how things pile up, and suicide starts to feel like an old friend, or sometimes, your only friend. A friend who can take you away from this cruel world, someone who is there for you when you’re ready. There is always fear when thinking it through and I’m sure it’s really intense if you are about to go through with it. The people who attempt suicide, they are beyond saving, the thought process leading up to is too long and painful. I’m still here and still too scared to go through with it. But I know the day will come someday when I lose fear. Once you lose fear, you’ve already lost everything else. It’s all so intense, and people see you as odd, or mentally ill. I hate it when people look and treat me like that, like they’re guilty, or if they talk to you in a certain way you’ll feel better. I want people to treat me normal, but it’s impossible after you discuss this topic. People see you as delicate, or a ticking time bomb.  They call you strong, but treat you like you’re weak. There’s no winning, I’m tired of feeling like this, tired of it all. Tired of hurting people, tired of being such a bad influence on my friends and family. I guess we can call it “depression.” This depression is eating me alive. I would say I want help, but all “help” is, is people in a hospital watching you and talking to you like a child. All “help” is, is a psychologist ending a meeting on a big issue to ensure you come back and pay them again.

Has anyone else have really bad suicidal thoughts even though your not particularly depressed?

I have this sick fascination with ending my own life, and I dont know why. the only thing keeping me from doing it is my wife and stepdaughter. also I start a really good job in a couple months, so I'm hoping if I can wait it out, I'll be happier when I start.

   I've battled many personal issues by myself over the years including my worst demon, opioid addiction in my late teens/early 20s after a bad work accident, but I'm 7 years sober from that.

   That was up until a few weeks ago, I was at work (I work alone in the feild) and I was fine that morning up until lunch time where out of no where I felt like I was having a heart attack full blown, almost called 911 instead went home and drove to the urgent care, they did tests, ekg, etc said I was fine and it was probably stress. so I go home and try to sleep it off but it hits me again but worse, my girlfriend drives me to the E.R. they did pretty much the same tests.

   A doctor came in and sat down with me and actually talked with me about my life which was very comforting. He told me he honestly thinks I have depression/anxiety and it combined with the stress of  work/home resulted in a bad panic attack and suggested I go see a physiologist. 

Fast forward, I see the new doc go through all the tests and she agrees I have anxiety and depression, which made me start thinking, I've never been the happy go lucky guy, the past few years have just been, well, Blah I havent really been ""happy"" since god knows when. My life now consists of work, eat, tv/game for a couple hours, sleep repeat

   She prescribed paxil at first, before talking it I did a bunch of reading from other people and it seemed more people than not hated it and had horrible withdrawls, so I told her I was concerned about taking it and havent took a single one. 

   She switched me to bupropion yesterday. And yet for some reason I'm still afraid to take it. I have it my truck and I want to take it, but for some reason I'm just afraid, I guess because I'm unsure of how it will make me feel while I'm at work. Should I wait and start it on the weekend while I'm home and safe? Did I make the right call not taking the paxil? Can you become addicted to them?

depression,"I’ve always had trouble with depression, since I was quite young It’s been getting worse to the point I’ve nearly taken my own life a few times. I’m 19 now and it’s really worse than ever honestly, but today at 2:00am it’s really different.. I don’t know if it’s the fact that no one’s up, or maybe I just feel a little lost tonight. But it’s a comfort knowing the world and me just don’t work, even if it’s not for the better. 

I know that a lot of people might feel similar, but I’ve almost constantly felt for the past few years that I just can’t wait for it to be over.. I really would want nothing more. Life is good with it’s ups occasionally and I don’t have much to complain about in terms of physical health, so you may even be able to call me somewhat selfish. But not that I take offence, my mental health is selfish and takes away my life day by day. 

I’ve always thought fighting it out to the last would be heroic and brave, but really for me at least it feels like a candle running out of wick.. or a slow burn. It’s just so hard to be at this point in my life, with all my opportunities in front of me.. without feeling like I want to live through any of it. 

Maybe it’s my shame and guilt, maybe it’s my mental health and genetics.. whatever it is life is just so bittersweet. Because I know I may just feel like this for the rest of the time I’m here.

about how life is so.. useless?

you die anyway,

and, what's the point of spending that much money, time and using so much of others' care.. when you're going to be gone anyway?

things have been hard lately.

this stupid quarantine really has proved to me that i'm just one lonely piece of garbage.

i feel so unmotivated lately.

i want to change, to be organised, to be a better person, to climb out of this cocoon of misery that's surrounding me, engulfing my thoughts, but.. i can't.

motivation, sounds like such a huge, heavy word that carries such a burden. 

i'm just the type of person who likes to bottle up things. likes to keep to themselves, likes to not say anything about myself. and lately, i want to try to undo that, but every time i try to, the people i talk to try to shrug it off like it's nothing, and act like i'm telling them a joke.

i don't know. i haven't slept great in such a long time, and insomnia really gets the better of me.

a few days ago, i was looking at some old photos and yearbooks, when, the realisation that i really had a life and dreams to live back then really hit me.

my friends all have some type of mental issue, and they, really, aren't very much like friends, and i don't blame them.

i don't know. i feel like such a failure. i've let everyone down. used them. treated it like it was for granted. wasted so much time and effort and care that they graciously given to us, and i just threw it away.

'fine', never means fine. i just don't want others to care, because i'm afraid i'll let them down and they'll just not care either.

i don't want to tell my parents. i'm afraid they'll agree that i'm a failure and tell me to improve and such, and then i'll let them down.

depression,"Looking for some reassurance it gets better...

Hi all. I’m 2 months pp and hoping to hear from others. it went well for about a month and then I crashed HARD. I’ve had anxiety and depression issues intermittently throughout life. I lost my milk supply due to anxiety which ended up making it worse with a rush of hormones and guilt that I wasn’t giving my daughter the best. I ended up in in-patient for a few nights as I thought I couldn’t do it anymore. 

Since then I’ve started on Citalopram and Trazedone for sleep. I believe the SSRI started to help a little bit but I feel like I can’t wait one more day to feel normal again. 

I love my daughter but every day is so hard. Getting out of bed is hard. Getting clothes on is hard. Washing bottles is hard. 

One of the worst things? I can’t sleep. As soon as I lay down I get a rush of adrenaline and heart palpitations. It makes taking care of my daughter even harder on a few hours of sleep a night. A couple nights I didn’t sleep one minute which required me to lean on my parents to take care of my daughter as I laid there like a zombie. 

Has anyone been here and have success stories? I keep thinking there’s so many women that do it why can’t I? why am I struggling so much? Will I ever sleep normal again? I’m so desperate.

I have a physical in September. Is it dumb to try to bring this up over a Telehealth meeting? Should I wait until my physical, am I putting unnecessary strain on health clinic employees? It’s already been years of this, should I put if off longer? 

I’m also really nervous about talking to my doc about this. For some reason, I’m terrified that my doctor is going to tell me I’m not depressed.

Everyone I love is dead. My life has no purpose, I have no ambition, I have no friends, I have no family, I have no hope.

I have double depression: long term, more mild dysthymia, and occasional major depressive episodes. I mostly struggle with the former.

depression,"People who suffer from depression don't think of it as ""suffering"". It is just a constant state of being. It's a constant dark companion.

They won't talk to or call a friend or family member because they are often told their feelings and thoughts are invalid. 

They are the ones who listen to your problems and try so hard to bring reason or healing - or bring a smile. Helping others sometimes helps them. 

They don't seek help because it's not a one-time event. It's regular or always. They love you too much to bother you that much. 

They don't think you'll understand. Of if you do, you'll grown as tired of them as they do of feeling that way.

Sometimes the reasons seem concrete and incontrovertible. Other times it's a vague darkness. Always, knowing others don't feel this way (this often) they feel broken and worthless ...adding to the problem. 

Sometimes it becomes crippling causing real problems in other areas of life and causing more (some would say, valid) reasons for hopelessness.

depression,"I am a 22 year old male, and I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I always felt a bit out of touch mentally with everything which could be to do with my autism that I was never told about, which I found out through some lost files after both of my parents died. On my 19th birthday my mum was rushed to hospital because of a brain haemorrhage which was totally out of the blue, and then she was quickly diagnosed with stage 3 brain cancer. I was always close to my mum as my parents were separated all my life, I loved her more than anything in the world and we would spend so much time together so this crushed me. She then passed away on Christmas day after spending the whole of new years till Christmas morning in the hospital. My mum had found a partner previous which she married when I was 17, making this partner my step-dad. I have two younger brothers and we were left with nothing in the will. We didn't even get a will hearing. My mum had won a lot of money previous which went straight towards a big house and then there were a lot of savings, she would have done anything she could for me and my brothers cause she was an amazing person.

This step-dad then became extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive towards my middle brother and alienated him from me and my youngest. I was working full time during this period also. Once my younger brother left (Half kicked out/half could not cope being in the house with step-dad) after his whole room being destroyed by step-dad over supposed lying, all the abuse came on to me and I couldn't see it at the time as he was the only adult figure I had in my life. He drank excessively, destroyed cars through drunk driving that my mum had paid for, told me there was no money left despite him constantly buying designer clothes, making me cook the same meals every night after work, belittled me and calling me pathetic and stupid. It was every single day I was being ground down and I hadn't grieved over the loss of my mum. I then ended up in a positive relationship with who is now my ex, who helped me to get out the house understand the manipulation i was put through etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To cut this short, I was not allowed to come back into the house for bullshit reasons such as it's him living his own life. Me and my brothers have not seen any inheritance or support whatsoever. I broke up with my girlfriend because I thought it was the right thing to do for my mental state but even if I wanted to get back with her things would be a mess and I would have totally lost the respect of her family and it is also incredibly difficult to even move to another flat cause of fucking money and paperwork. I also have university now but I can't even finish my year cause of this virus, and it requires me to work with other people for my last modules which is impossible to do according to the brief. I've had a package thrown at me by step-dad's new fucking wife who the police is now involved with and I havent got any response back from any solicitor saying that this case with contesting the will is just a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost hope in humanity, this world, the law, and education which i was enjoying right until the outbreak. Police are murdering people in America, police can't fucking do anything in the UK that's positive. The government are full of hypocrites, and there is no support whatsoever in my situation. Not to mention that I have not stopped working despite this outbreak cause I'm a supposed key worker, I still can't afford to even feed myself cause it's minimum wage. This clapping bullshit is absolutely pathetic. So basically this outbreak has not changed anything for me in terms of work, and uni. There's absolutely nothing I can do, cause having money is what this world measures success as.

depression,"Hi everyone,

So my problem is in the title. Had bad depression with suicidal attempts for most of my life. Mental hospital was shit that screwed me up even more. My personal psychiatrist has tried her best but nothing works.

We tried everything. Medicine: sertraline, citolopram, cymbalta, paxil, trazodone, mitrazapine, buproprion, amitriptyline, notriptyline, quetiapine (for sleep). Plus Psychotherapy, talk therapy and hypotherapy.

Therapy doesn't do shit for me, because I have real problems and no resourses to solve them. Talking can't doesn't solve big problems. I was hoping that that medication could reduce some of my symptoms, depression, mental function etc. They all failed to help in any way, also they all gave me bad side effects, which caused me to develop additional health problems (in addition to various already existing chronic problems that I had before).

The only thing that was really helping me was some lifestyle chances, church, talking to my priest, etc. I was still depressed, but I somehow had everything together, until about two weeks ago I started falling apart again. The last few days were even worse, depression is suffocating me, I lost my ability to think properly, and I cant eat for the last 2 days. Anything I force myself to eat ends up being immediately vomited out (this is a weird thing which always happens when I'm really down).

But I don't know what the fuck to do? If I go back to the hospital, they would just put me back on the same medications and therapies that never did anything in the first place.

Not to mention I hate that hospital because they massively screwed up my medical records: one of many examples -  A drunk racist man attacked me and threatened to kill me (I'm black). Well after that I was nervous, because someone actually tried to kill me. After the incident I had a few drinks to calm myself down because well someone tried to kill me (there are many witnesses who can prove I was right).

You know what those doctors wrote? That I suddenly developed bipolar, got myself drunk and attacked a random man. That's a complete lie, they never bothered asking the witnesses if what I said was the truth, and those people are willing to talk, hotel staff, waiters, etc they saw everything happen, and were willing to talk to the police, but the police never showed up, because the doctors told them I was bipolar. I was never bipolar, I'm down all the fucking time.

Maybe I could go to another hospital. But what is the point when they'll give me the same meds and treatments that don't work on me?

I feel like I'm going to explode, and I don't know what to do. Antidepressants and Therapy are the standard ways of fixing this problem, and neither of them work for me. It doesn't seem like there is anything that I could do, even if I did check myself in. Maybe I'll just stay here until I collapse.",Depression's stronger than ever.

At 11 I went to CAMHS which helps young people with depression I had 2 psychologists one was a guy that I had for 2 months and the other was a lady, we'll call her B for private reasons, B was helpful at first but then she started to support and take sides with my primary school by saying ""You have learning needs"" ""you are disabled"" which hurt me alot since a lot of kids say to me ""no one likes you"", ""you're pathetic"", and the last time i saw B was couple of years, i got angry and started to charge at her with a chair that I was sitting on, I didn't hurt her but she backed away a bit and she wrote to CAMHS she can't do therapy for me, then I had other psychologists that are 2 males they helped me alot but they couldn't continue because they had to deal with other kids with mental illness, my home life wasn't great either my parents are devout Christians and think depression and mental illness is fake and BS they neglected me alot and never give me the things I wanted they tell me to pray to ""God"" and ""Jesus"" for mental stress and so on, my parents treated me harshly and also called me ""You are nothing"", ""you're a sinner"".

At this stage, you're too senile to no longer travel, your joints hurt to the point where you can barely walk around the block. You're just there, alone with your thoughts.

What do you want to think about?

So many of us sacrifice precious hours of our lives in our 20s doing, perhaps, shit all. You reach 30, then you realise, ""holy shit I'm 30"" and then proceed to get your shit together. Some people don't - they remain stuck with the 20-year-old mindset. Sleeping around, drinking, procrastinating important things to do in life, going through meaningless relationships that inevitably fail due to unaddressed personal problems…

Perhaps you have kids, but you're nowhere near ready to have them. You're cynical, you want them to be what you want them to be - you fail to learn how to parent properly and in doing so your children don't give you the love and affection that you once thought you'd inherit.

Quite a cynical view right? Yeah, it is. BUT.

As long as you're not on your deathbed I truly believe we all are capable of change. No one can change the past, not even God. What you could do though is change the way you view your past. Perhaps the things I've listed above may resonate with you, but, it's okay.

We're human and in being human we're fallible to life's tragedies. Perhaps you could even argue that's what gives life it's diversity.

I know some people who've changed careers when they hit 40.

Some people have kids in their teens and that drove them into adulthood with vigour and courage.

Some people start their business at 50 after a long career, slaving away in corporate life for 20 years.

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg in what may encompass diversity in people's lives. It's important to realise no matter what mistakes you've made in the past, it's time to reconcile with them and conceptualise it into one of learning, and experience. It's hard, don't get me wrong. We all have perhaps made fucked up mistakes that have led to where we are today.

depression,"**Disclaimer:** *This post has to due with sexual themes, so if this could possibly be a trigger for you, please do scroll passed. Thank you.*

Before I start, let me preface something; I'm one-hundred and ten percent a virgin. Don't assume for a second that I'm some Chad complaining that I get too much sex or something. I've never even hugged or dated a girl before, let alone have sexual relations with one. That being said, I'll start. 

I hate sex and being sexually driven. I'm seventeen, so my hormones are constantly skull-fucking me, no pun intended. I get aroused many times throughout the day and it happens easier than I'd like to admit. When I get that way I often make stupid decisions, or I'll talk to a person in the hopes of sexual gain whether I'm aware of it or not. I'll watch excessive amounts of pornography just to help get it over with so I can move on with my day. Does it keep me from doing things? No, I can live without masturbating, but it's so, so fucking annoying to be aroused when I'm trying to just go about my day.

You may ask ""Why do you hate it so much? It's one of the few pleasures people like us have."" or something like that. Well, quite frankly, I find that statement to be ignorant. I'd rather go my whole life being a virgin if it meant I could maintain what little innocence I have left in my being. To be able to pursue a relationship without having to question whether I only like them because I want to have sex with them or if it's because I truly love them. To be able to take things lightly and not always assume that the things people say are euphemisms and shit like that. I want to be able to look at a girl and think ""Wow, she seems nice."" or ""Wow, I really enjoy her outfit."" rather than ""Man, the things I'd do to her."" or ""Man, she is *way* out of my league."" It can be really, really fucking debilitating. I hate when I'm in public or with a female acquaintance and my eyes trail off to parts of her body as if they were fucking magnetic. I hate it, I hate it, I *hate* it.

I know being as young as I am may be a deterrent for most of the people on here. ""Oh, you're too young and juvenile to understand."" Fuck you.

In the last few years, I feel like I have been a shell of a person, unable to commit to anything because I'm either depressed or anxious. I haven't pursued any of the dreams of things I set out to, because I spend most of my time stuck in my own misery.
