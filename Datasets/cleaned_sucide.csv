SuicideWatch,"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",t3_cz6nfd,1

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here.

SuicideWatch,"All I want is to be a normal person who can just *do* the things they need to. Instead, it's an immense struggle just to motivate myself, convince myself my life isn't worthless, for even half an hour. And no matter what I do — whether I try to use that motivation to better myself, learn things, exercise, or I just sit around and do nothing, it always ends the same way. Wondering why I ever felt optimistic. Everything is such an effort. Sometimes breathing is too much of an effort. 

How can people not only come up with something that makes them happy to be alive, but *work* towards those things?

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here.

I've realized that I'm unattractive, I have a weak chin and two broken front teeth and my parents don't give a single shit about that, my lips are too small and my nose is too big or wide, I have acne and scars, everything about my face just doesn't fit. I'm overweight too to make it worse.

I live in asia. I hate the country that I live in right now, it's a 3rd world country with corrupt leaders. I don't like how close minded the people here. This country is also very religious and homophobic and I'm a raging bisexual who's mostly into men, I dunno I might just be gay. I'm still struggling with my sexuality and. I can't relate to anyone here cause we don't share a lot of interests. I mostly watch western shows and I can relate more to western pop culture, the people I follow on youtube and tiktok and other socials are mostly westerns too. I don't have friends to talk to about my interests and no one will get the references and jokes I'd make so I just don't talk.

I have two older brothers and a younger sister and we don't talk at all, my parents also don't talk to each other. Because we're poor I have to share a room with my father and two brothers so I don't really get even a tiny bit of privacy to be myself. 

I'm tired of living like this, living a gay, ugly, fat, poor, and uninteresting life. Everyday since this quarantine started I've thought about ending my life.

i could see the edge, i felt like jumping. i saw her, and i swear she ignored me. i couldn't do that though but i carefully observed the place for the best part to do it.

somebody offered me sleep medicine, and i spit out my first cup but drank more. suddenly, she went near and held me.

it's fake. she just doesnt want to be caught being in the same place and not doing anything and i dont want to settle for lies.

I've convinced myself before that I'm a coward for giving up and that I need to try absolutely everything before going through with it. But at this point I'm just done.

At school, home and in public, I been constantly ripped on for being disabled and existing in this cold world. My grammar is at 4th grade level at best. Autism has caused me to be completely unresponsive and shut down on others when I attempted to communicate and relate to others, so the internet is the only way to communicate. 

My philosophy about people with intellectual disability and autism is they should live in apartheid type of segregation, and deserve no dignity and get treated as a convicted child molester. And my mom didn’t like my autism and that abet me from having a bad attitude towards the disabled, lgbt and any genetic lowlives. 

Suicide isn’t a way out of this merciless suffering, being a murderer, ruthless person will. The fact is that slow people are more likely to commit abhorrent felony than the general population, and that’s considered INFERIOR BEHAVIOUR!

I don’t really know anymore. I am overwhelmed by various mental illnesses, and all of them together is just absolute HELL. I didn’t think one person could have so many mental illnesses....

I still miss my first love. I’m so dumb because we were together for such a tiny period of time and we were 15, but it felt so real and it felt like we’d been together for a long ass time. When she broke up with me, something inside of me broke. Something just kind of...left. And I haven’t been able to get it back. Shit SUCKED back then. She was the only positive thing about that time. But yet when you look at pictures of me back then and compare them to pictures of me now, something looks to be missing. Like something tore me apart. It’s in my eyes, for the most part. I guess my eyes look more dull now, after experiencing that. I didn’t realize that a short relationship would destroy me so much and that I was nothing without her.

We’re coming up on some painful anniversary dates now. It’s been 6 years since our relationship. I don’t know what makes a 6 year anniversary so painful, but this year it just seems excruciating beyond belief. The circumstances surrounding the breakup make it worse.

I’m so lonely. I’ve been single for like a year or more, despite trying so many dating apps. No one is attracted to me. It’s really sad how some people my age are having relationships that have lasted for like 5+ years, meanwhile I can’t even keep a relationship for more than 3 months most of the time. My longest relationship was 9 months, but that’s it. I’m unlovable, I guess.

This quarantine isn’t necessarily helping either. Let me talk about some of the mental shit I’ve been going through during this whole pandemic.

Even before it was declared a pandemic, I was terrified and convinced that it would come here. Well, guess what? It DID. And it’s apparently hit us harder than any other country. Lovely. Especially when I worry about my health in general (I have Illness Anxiety Disorder; it was formerly known was hypochondria but that’s an outdated term that, honestly, I don’t really appreciate because at this point it’s used more of a joke or insult so I hate that word).

When it was declared a pandemic, I was horrified. It didn’t make it any better that I came down with an awful “cold” (looking back on it, I think I might’ve had it...I won’t go into detail but let’s just say it was awful). Earlier on, I saw lots of posts about how stores were super crowded, how people were hoarding toilet paper, etc.
I remember pacing back and forth in my living room, asking my parents a bunch of questions no one could really answer at the time. “What does this mean?” “When is this gonna end?” “Who the hell brought it to the US?!” “It’s not in (insert my city name here), is it?” “How much longer until we can do normal stuff again?”

However, early on I was able to keep a positive attitude. Even when I was sick, I told my mom, “If I do have it, I want to take the opportunity to help other patients by giving blood or participating in some kind of study. I just want to help and would gladly use this to help others.”

Within a few weeks, though, my fear turned to rage. Absolute, unadulterated rage. My mind was trying desperately to place the blame on someone who was involved, and my rage was mainly directed at whoever brought it to the US. The reason was because it’s more abstract to be mad at the world; it’s rather simple when you can blame a single person. I guess that’s how my thought process works. Sometimes in these attacks of rage I was unable to see straight because I was so mad. (Now might be a good time to mention I have borderline personality disorder so that makes it so much worse)

And then I went numb. I was completely unable to cry. I started isolating myself from friends (isolating in all senses of the word; of course, I’m a responsible person so I’m respecting the mandatory quarantine, but I’m also not really staying in touch with friends I used to text or call every day). I was in denial for the longest time. I was irritable beyond belief. I started snapping over the tiniest things. I seemed to be on edge all the time. I’m a very jumpy person, but I mean I’d be startled by the sound of a light switch. It was bad. And it’s still going on.

I’m having constant nightmares. Sometimes I’ll wake up screaming or panicking. A good percentage of them are about the virus. Others are just generally about death and destruction. In most if not all of my dreams, I’m fully aware that we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Sleep is no escape.

I went through a period of being incredibly tired. I couldn’t be comfortably awake for more than like 5 hours without feeling tired and having to resist the temptation to fall asleep again. Luckily this only lasted a while, and it’s gotten a lot better, but I’m still sleeping a lot.

I’m not really taking care of myself either. I can’t tell you the last time I showered. Not brushing my teeth regularly nor washing my face or applying my face cream, not using deodorant, etc. because what’s the point? I’m also emotionally eating.

The other day I dissociated so much I legitimately questioned whether the world was real or simply a simulation. I convinced myself nothing was real, that everything was in my head. It’s scary feeling so detached and not there.

If you read this far, thank you. It’s been really hard and my already-intense emotions seem to be a bit stronger during this. I do believe that I am going to develop agoraphobia. Hell, I even Googled “is it possible to stay home for the rest of your life” yesterday. I know that, even after quarantine ends, I’ll still refuse to go out. I haven’t left the house since March 11th. I took a walk around the block like a month ago, with a mask on, but that was it. I won’t even get in the car for a car ride because I’m so paranoid.

The world is so fucked up too, so I wonder what the point is. There will always be animal abusers, abusers in general, crimes, etc and there’s nothing I can do about it, and that’s absolutely not a world I want to live in. I’m just super overwhelmed.",I just don’t know anymore.,t3_gtce77,1

SuicideWatch,"Seven billion of us all packed together on a spinning ball of rock. I feel like I'm incapable. Of living properly, the way our society is built. All I've ever wanted was a purpose, I guess. Childhood years of TV and books boasting hero's with greater divine purpose made me bitter about my own pointless existence. In every story there's the protagonist. I feel as though I'm not even the protagonist to my own story. There's no great quest, no objective. 

On top of that, out of seven billion people on this shit hole planet, I am a sorry excuse for anything. I am the biggest waste of talent and space I know. I could do so much better but for whatever reason my whole life I've always been stopping myself. All I do is scroll endlessly on my phone. I can't change. It just doesn't work. I'm stuck because my own brain will always be fucking me over, and I can't live with the what could have beens. I've shot down so many opportunities for me to succeed. I don't have a chance when everyone else on this planet is better than me it seems. Maybe that's irrational but I can't help looking at others and comparing myself. I don't stack very high.

I'm so scared of not being able to find a niche. Like I'll just be bumbling around at various dead end jobs without living up to my full potential.

SuicideWatch,"I am sorry in advance this is going to be a little long. I am a 22 year old male who suffers severe depression, Social anxiety and maybe even more that i don't know about. Just a little backstory: 

I was born in a developing dirt poor country but grew up in Germany, Berlin from ages 2-12. My mother was physically very abusive towards me the last time she beat me i still clearly remember she used to hit me to the ground and stomp on my knees even when I was crying my eyes out she didn't care and my dad didn't really do much aside from pathetically pleading a little. I feel sorry for my mother because she never really lived before coming to Germany i think that's why she lost it so much. She had me when she was 15. My mother was a housewife and living under my father for almost a decade. My father had especially at that time the midset that women are lesser. Anyway I grew up with my father for most of the time and he really tried to fuck me up mentally just because he grew up a certain way in a different environment he thought he was right. I went to school til 5th grade and halfway through my father took me with him back to his origin country. I didn't really have a say in it. He was scared that my mother would take me away from him and because of their fights i was the one being fucked. Imagine growing up in a first world country and then somebody throws you to fucking animals in another place. From 12-17 I had the worst time of my life! Alot of people there were racist, sexist and violent and for alot of people it was the norm. They don't understand depression or any other disorder. If you can't see it it must be unimportant. I was bullied in school everyday from 7th to 9th grade. My teacher was somewhat of a bully too and she made fun of me alot for being the way i am closed off, had extreme ocd at the time too and nobody understood. Cousins were the worst assholes imaginable i am glad i'm away from them. At the time I didn't have anywhere to run to and the hope that someday i'll get out was the only thing keeping me going. When I was 17 my father understood that this country isn't for me and took me with him to Russia. There I started working my first job at a restaurant for 2 years. We both did. After 2 years of that I couldn't take it anymore because i was fatigued and hated the job and the disorders don't help. The reason we did all this was my Visa for Germany expired after months after leaving and the documents were either thrown away or lost. My father decided that in Russia we could somehow make some money and pay for documents and everything(Don't judge please). The last 2 years i haven't worked at all. The place that i worked at the owner was a friend of my father so no workpermint was required. After being depressed as hell and with no hope i got out of there had some fight with the owner who was a real prick and now i am jobless. I know my father is sorry for what he did to me but i resent him and sincerely wish him death. I don't care that half of the time he was good the bad was truly unpleasant. Unfortunately we live together and in the moment he is the only one working and i don't know what to do. My destination has always been to come to the states and become an actor(I know theres millions of those) but  that's who i am theres nothing i can do beside that. I even got professional headshot done and opened a backstage account but bad fucking luck for me because after 1 month this fucking Virus hit the world and now i am stuck. Thrown out of 2 apartments allready because some people don't care that there is no work. This has been the worst 22 years of my life! I don't want to keep going and every year i get more and more depressed. I blocked people out of my life not only the bad ones. For some reason i don't like to be around people. I am a virgin and never was in a relationship mostly through my own fault. Don't have any friends. As much as i am a loner sometimes i get extremely sad and have a panic attack. I might be at home and fall to the ground and break down and start crying. I have body dismorphia also but some days i can handle it. I feel weak and pathetic for not being able to  help myself. I have mommy issues. Sometimes when i see a mother on the street holding their child i am very happy for them and at the same time i get extremely sad that i'll never have that. I am crying while typing this down i am so sorry for this long post but theres sooo many feelings inside of me that i don't know how to write down. I remember seeing Mad men and Don Drapers depression really resonated with me. For the past 2 years my depression has been getting worse and worse and i can't get out of this rut and i don't know what to do. People expect me to get over it, the bad relationship with my father gets worse and worse but i know i can't keep fighting with him over what he did, i have nobody in my life because of being a recluse. I feel like i never grew up and it's soo difficult getting out of my comfort zone. Been thinking about killing myself more times than i can remember but i lack the courage to do so but i always come back to it. I don't want to suffer! I know that everybody has to look out for themselves but i can't do this alone. I am a scared little kid in a grown up body. Someday my death will be by suicide i can feel it. I cant imagine living another 30 to 40 years because no matter how good things might be the damage is already done the scars are deep.

I HOPE NOBODY EVER GOES THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. 22 YEARS HAVE SUCKED THE LIFE OUT OF ME. I USED TO BE THE HAPPIEST KID BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST LONG. FUCK MY PARENTS AND FUCK MY LIFE.

TLDR at the bottom 

She has a very abusive family, her mom beats and belittles everyday. Since her mom is so crazy her dad is stressed out because of it and treats her like shit because he's stressed out because of her mom. And her little sister was manipulated into only trusting her mom because her mom is manipulative. And it's been like this her entire life, and now that she's stuck inside with her family because of quarantine it's gotten a lot worse.

Even when her mom kicks her out she'll search the streets and go to all of her friends house to find and drag her back to their home again. And i've always tried to stay positive but she just kind of broke recently. And tbh yeah her situation is pretty damn hopeless. Until she can graduate highschool and be on her own she's stuck being abused mentally and physically for the next two years. 

How do I keep her from killing herself when it seems like she doesn't really have any other option left? How do I keep her motivated to stay alive when there's really nothing else to live for?

Well, for some reason, I have multiple friends that have depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. And when I say ""multiple"", I mean all of them. Idk why, tho

Had the ""live is good and continue"" talk to many times, it actually helped most of them, but some... just, no matter what I do, it's always someone who I can't help, someone who captivated me and now is just... Leaving. Leaving me, and all that they could live for. 

I had the talk to many times, it failed to many times, I'm scared and it's meaning just start do disappear. I'm going to be like them? I don't want to keep it, don't want to keep this life without them. I always think the problem is me, most of my friends are like this and maybe it's me who brings it to their life???  But, I fear that if I gave up and make what they did, my other friends are going to be sad like me and I don't want them to be sad.

I have a family who is not supportive or whatever, it's just a ""do your work and have good grades. If u don't, u aren't going to get food or things u like"", because of it I searched for friends who could be the family who I need/wanted. Found them, and they are just fucked up like me, I do my best for them! So why Everytime I say I am the one who is felling really down, they say like ""Oh, me too, wants to know why I'm felling down and ignore whatever u was going to say about ur life or whatever""? I mean, I always listen to them, why they can't listen me one time? 

I mean, I'm not really complaining about them, they are the only ones who accepted me, I love them. But be the one who always need to """"""""""""""save"""""""""""""" them is tiring af. I just want to have a conversation with them, just one who I can say my problems and not listen theirs. I mean, I know it's probably arrogant and egoistic, but, one time is just everything I need.

I lost so many friends and family to suicide, and I can't take it anymore. Do u know how it feels don't knowing when one of the most important persons of u live are just gonna disappear? And its just gonna be your fault, MY fault.

I don't know what to do anymore.

SuicideWatch,"Hi folks, 

A few months ago I made an attempt (I’m not sure if it was real or a cry for help myself) for the first time in life. 32 years old. Anyone who knows me would say I used to be the life and soul and a happy go lucky kinda guy. 

Over last few years I’ve deteriorated.

The reason I’m here today to ask for help (as these strong feelings of suicide aren’t new).

My life unravelled around this time last year when I pissed of an entire workplace by basically being a nob. It started with some nasty comments and then became a vicious circle of bullying and me being abrasive because of it. Through cocaine, other drugs and heavy mental abuse and bullying towards me I basically imploded. I sent some nasty text messages that have been used against me and follow me everywhere (workplaces) by people I pissed off. 
After not being able to get away from gaslighting in other workplaces I made the attempt on my life. Since the attempt now my friends are making comments and also seem to have no empathy nor care for what they’re doing.

Unfortunately I’ve now lost all my friends, and family. No job. No money. And am currently residing at my grandmother’s who is supporting me. My grandmother lives where I grew up and people just make comments to me about stuff that happened at that workplace. I’ve been dragged through the mud because of that places fear of a court case. It’s a long story and I don’t think telling it would help any advice. It’s all my fault, but I’m not what I’ve been made out to be.

I can’t motivate myself anymore for tomorrow, I’m scared, upset and hurt. The worse part is I’m now gaslighted by everyone (dad, sister, so called friends).

They won’t tell me anything but yet still make comments.

Basically I’m at rock bottom, and today I ran out of tobacco so everything’s on top of me right now.

Any enjoyment seems so far away. I honestly feel powerless and lost and I used to have such a drive in me.

I’ve got into a wierd horrible habit of planning to kill myself a week later so that that week in question seems easier but even that fails to cheer me up.

SuicideWatch,"The past couple days, I've been feeling incredibly down, and it always ends with me wanting to end it all. But then again, I fear the pain that comes with death. I finally had enough when I was so scared of myself that I texted a crisis hotline. About two minutes into our conversation, the worker on the other end just told me that they were concerned for my safety and asked if I wanted to end my life. I was pretty sure she was going to call the local police department if I had said anything else. I got super scared because while I was thinking about death, I still had no plan, and I still live with my parents but they don't know what I am going through. Because of that, I decided to make it seem like I was just struggling in school and not doing that well because of COVID, (true to some extent, but not the root of my thoughts). 

I feel with these hotlines, while they are helpful to some, in many situations, they are too direct to the book instead of actually listening to your feelings. I would have been okay speaking about my suicidal tendencies, in that I had not really come up with a plan but just have been thinking about it, but the fact that the worker mentioned that they were concerned and going to get me help really worried me. I think that if the conversation just went as normal, it would have cleared up the thoughts on its own.

I need to leave this place or I will never earn the respect of anyone. People even looked down on me when I was 21 in this position. And I spent so much time smoking weed. I'm only two weeks clean. It could take fucking months until I can even piss clean. I think every fucking minute about how I'm going to afford to live. Every asshole tells you something different. Oh you need to stay at home and get an education. Oh you need to get the fuck out out at all costs. Oh don't worry about what people think as long as you have a plan. Move away to a different town. Stop being a pussy and join the military. This and that, this and that, this and that. But what do I want? I don't want fucking anything anymore. Two weeks clean, one month down of living on an actual budget, trying to figure out how much more housing is going to cost. I live in a piece of shit area where the rent even with roommates is going to be too much. Enough to be barely scraping by on but not enough to even be upwardly mobile in life. Then assholes tell you go fuck yourself just join the military or stay at home and go to school or get an apprenticeship. But I can't deal with the fucking shame of being here anymore.

SuicideWatch,"i've never used reddit before but i have no one to go to anymore, so please understand as i type this out. if anyone is out there, though, please help me. i'm sorry this is long, but i can't stop waking up feel hopeless.

i am not going to lie and change my story to garner pity, but i will provide context so people know what is going on and why i feel this way. i was rightfully called out (along with a friend) for ignoring someone in months ago when they (i'm going to call them person A) asked for my help, specifically when they were getting racist lynching and anti-r\*pe threats. person A asked me to do something because they thought my friends had something to do with it and felt desperate. i feel guilty for not at least trying to help this black teen especially in times like these. i was not close to them but they were an old friend my friends cut off, and i was under the impression person A was a liar and sought out petty drama because of the things i was told. but i am not going to defend me being an awful bystander by saying i didn't know. i will say i told them the threats were vulgar and horrible, but said there was no way i could control the person sending them to them because i was also receiving similar things like people anonymously telling me to kill myself on social media. i told person A ""i have the flu, i'm a full-time college student, please don't accuse my friends of doing this"" and i regret that. on top of that, i turned a blind eye to one of my friends making racist tweets a while ago because she was my friend and i was letting that cloud my own judgement. i'm angry at myself for that alone because being chinese, i should KNOW better. i know better now, but i should've known better THEN. i am ashamed of myself for not doing anything. not doing anything is not any better than doing something. i was a bystander. i am angry at myself and i was prepared to face the consequences of my poor decisions because i believed it was fair. i refuse to run from my mistakes like those who have hurt me have. and this all came to the notice of my friends about 2 days ago.

at first, i apologized over and over and acknowledged that i was not doing my part as a POC and being an ally to others. i've said it so many times i feel like a broken record. i know i deserve to face the consequences, but i did not think it included losing all my friends. and to those who are reading this, they may wonder why losing all my friends feels like i am dying. my biological family is broken and i am a victim of abuse, so i do not trust them. i am already depressed and some other people in my life, more distant friends, wouldn't understand and aren't particularly good at comforting. my main friends are the only ones who feel like a genuine family, and i was happiest with them. these were the people who would pick me up when i was down and help me laugh. but having 99% of them cut me off was like i got my own heart ripped out. during quarantine, too, i'm so desperate for any semblance of contact. i miss seeing group chats light up, i miss waking up and calling my friends, and i miss all of them. but after they cut me off, i don't know how they're feeling, some of them replied to me bluntly, and many of them told me they were disappointed in me. everything i've said to try and express my remorse is met with silence or it feels like what i say is being misinterpreted constantly. i am already bad at writing down my thoughts. i know i deserve to be yelled at it but it hurts to read alone because i'm stupidly sensitive. it hurts knowing they're in another group chat laughing together when i wish that were me, knowing they're discussing ""what to do with me"" and wishing i could just speak. but i'm scared of what they may say, having my words twisted, and not saying the right thing.

being alone yesterday for only a few hours drove me up the wall and i started sobbing in and out of the day because i felt like i had nothing and i didn't want to live with myself because i was so disappointed in myself. i rarely cry unless i really am in a lot of pain. i was sad that i had nothing to reach out to and i was grasping at air. i haven't been this alone since i was 15 and battling my suicidal thoughts then. i need someone to talk to and i don't know what to do. i have so many questions and i can't sleep because i am haunted by what i have done. i haven't eaten anything in over 24 hours except for maybe some watermelon, and i still don't feel hungry. i sat on my bed in the afternoon and looked out the windows and the sky was practically gray. all i could hear were the cars driving past me and thinking is it really worth living is this how you'll feel every day? unable to live with yourself and alone? i refuse to forgive myself. and if i cannot forgive myself, i don't see the point of staying alive. i want to step in front of those cars so badly, but they might not even put me out of my misery. the pain is not worth staying alive, but how do i make it stop?

there's so many things i want to say. i'm partly confused why my friends cut me off when a lot of them also did the same thing as me, making fun of the person afflicted, as we all immaturely gave in to things like mob mentality. they egged me on. i egged them on. we were all complicit in hurting person A, not myself alone. and i don't say this because i'm in pain and i want them to be in pain with me. but i'm not sure why only i should be punished, rightfully so, when i was in a similar boat as everyone else. the only difference, i think, was that i was the one approached. i provided the reply. i feel like i am breaking not only under the weight of my wrongdoings, but the wrongdoings of others, too. but i'm scared to vent about it in other places because i do not want to be seen as guilt-tripping or grasping at straws.

now i've reached the part that i'm incredibly scared about. i've been suicidal times in my life, when things have been bad, but nothing like this. i've never called a suicide hotline before because i've been too scared to, but i needed someone to talk to so badly. an adult with more knowledge, someone who could tell me how to fix this, or give me a reason to be alive. i called 4 times and sobbed every time on the floor in my closet with disgusting wet tissues, one was a man and he gave me very half-hearted and poor responses, and i was disheartened almost every time. i don't want to live without my friends. i don't want to live with myself. i don't have anything else to look forward to in my life anymore. i feel betrayed not because of my actions, but that my friends aren't willing to acknowledge that we were all bad to person A. i feel betrayed by myself for not living up to my strong morals. i'm trying so hard to be mature but it's so hard when all i want to do is breakdown and cry. all i do is lay down in bed, with nothing to laugh at, unable to sleep or distract myself with things i like to watch. i am empty. i keep trying to find a reason to live, because killing myself sounds so scary, but it seems like the easiest and best option. my friends don't need me. no one needs me. but i am afraid. please help me.",please help me i feel like i have nothing,t3_gtfqxh,1

Giving up sounds so much easier than trying to fight it off honestly. I always surrender to those thoughts, I never have a clue how to go about dealing with them at this point that I don’t even try. 

I have some sort of paranoia, so when I lay in bed at night wondering if someone might break in, I don’t often fear them dragging me off my bed and shooting me point blank. Yet in other cases, my mind and body acts differently and automatically makes choices to save myself. It’s stupid. 

Apparently still being alive means you don’t want to die and that you want to be here. How utterly bullshit that is, I probably couldn’t encompass in this one post. I’m only here because you fuckers can’t live without me, not because I want to be. 

Lives are literally at stake if I take mine away. My best friend follows the same fate, the other one becomes extremely depressed, they all wonder where they went wrong or what they could have done differently to change the circumstances or to save me.

So no, it’s not some cheery “well a part of you is subconsciously wanting to live!” bullshit. I’m only here because of other people, I’m basically making the choice to live in this cruel world and suffer for others to be happy having me around, where my only escape is sleep. 

And they don’t even appreciate me for that, they only want to make excuses to try and dictate and pick out how I’m feeling as if they’re in my body and understand my feelings. It’s a poor form of empathy or understanding. It’s pathetic. 

Apparently chickening out on every attempt you make means you want to be alive. Also complete and utter bullshit, I chicken out because I think of *you* idiots who would have to find my body. I think of *you* fuckers that would be sad without my existence. It’s because not because I want to be alive, it’s because I’m sparing ***you*** the trouble. 

So to sit and tell me, as another suicidal person, “well, I’m still alive because everyone wants me to be, therefore you should do the same”- THATS EXACTLY WHAT IVE BEEN FUCKING DOING THIS WHOLE TIME, EVEN IF I ABSOLUTELY DONT WANT TO. ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU CANT SEE THE REAL MOTIVE BEHIND MY ACTIONS, AND CHOOSE TO MAKE UP YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS. 

Anyways I apologize for getting riled up, I’m just honestly completely and utterly pissed off that people can choose to sit here and make their own conclusions about your thoughts and feelings without taking into account your reasons and motives behind acting the way you do.

It comes off less as supportive and understanding, but more as “I don’t understand what you’re going through at all, therefore I’m going to sit here and dismiss the way in which you feel and make up my own conclusions to suit myself and my selfish needs”.",Apparently I don’t even have a say in dictating choices for my own life anymore,t3_gta7bx,1

Thank you for the people who read this and gave some time to notice my situation. 

Lets start. 

I was never the type of person to be sad and emo ( in fact I was the normal kid who makes people laugh by ridiculing myself) I really liked the impression people smiling when I try to make their day less shitty. (this was when I was 14 and starting 3rd year highschool) me and my 2 friends j (jensen) T (tyson) would always walk a really long way to sit on a big overpass and just talk about what happened in our day and after that we go home and do it again the next. 

It started when my 2 sisters criticising me over ""why do you ridicule yourself, aren't you being a bit weird?"" at first I pay no mind to this since they are just asking and I just shrug them off but it started to roam inside my mind, the sentence that she gave. (note : my 2 sisters N : older sister and C : middle sister and me D ; male youngest. My sisters were top notch students and had high paying jobs and basically the breadwinners while im still here stuck in last year highschool) . 

They gradually make remarks about my personality on being a ""class clown"" and slowly calling me stupid to retarded which shocked me to the point that I can't give a reaction. And when I make some food for myself they always say to me that ""your cooking again? How much of a retarded cook can you be?"" I can't talk back to them since my parents would just side to them and just shrug it off knowing that it will happen again. 

I never talked back to my sisters and parents to which im basically a robot, listening to their needs and do their chores. The remarks slowly burned through me till I became numb to the shit talk. And in school is just the same thing but far more worse since my bully is a smart douchebag whom the teachers can't complain since he's the ""top 1 in my class"" it sucks everything sucks every time I go home with J and T I was always on the verge of crying on the edge of breaking down mentally but they were their to give me tough love which helped but they soon moved houses or went home to their province which damaged me more. 

Here is when my mind went dark after my family announced. 

I got home finished junior high and they said in a serious voice ""son you should become a soldier"" I was surprised and laughed at first but then they said ""your sisters are financially stable and we can live more comfortably now and we would want you to go to the military and when you finish, our family can have the benefits for you becoming a soldier"" I said to them I'll think about it and went on outside. 


I walked through the day mindlessly going to the over pass on which my friends used to hang out and sit on the railings thinking about jumping off. 

Imagine your whole life learning something that you want to pursue and achieve that dream only to be caught in a choice between helping your parents in a way in which you have to sacrifice that dream or pursue that dream and be shunned by family. 

I cant process any of this. It doesn't hurt, I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad im just numb my brain just feels heavy and closing my eyes helps soften the numbing that im feeling. 

Im sorry if you didn't understand some of this. English is not my first language.

SuicideWatch,"For the last few years I’ve (30F) been battling with crippling forms of depression and anxiety. I’ve seen multiple psychiatrists, psychologists, and participated in many forms of therapy. I’ve tried many different medications and various forms of treatment such as exercising, eating certain foods, meditation, etc. I’ve checked myself into psych units on multiple occasions (I have mental breakdowns every few months from exhausting treatment options and feeling suicidal) Once the thoughts of suicide become overwhelming I try to control it by putting myself in an environment where I’m constantly monitored. I have truly exhausted every route and suggestion been given to me. I’ve tried “natural” routes such as various herbs and even medical marijuana. I began reading studies of the effects of magic mushrooms on depression, all it did was make me more aware of how truly depressed I am. I studied articles and the personal experience of others for weeks before I attempted this. 

At one point I stopped eating meat because I read somewhere that if something was sad and depressed when it died that the sadness and depression could enter your own body. 

I’ve become obsessed with trying to heal my mind. I’ve never put so much effort into anything. I’m desperate to feel relief, to feel anything besides how I feel now and have felt for years. For a long time I didn’t wanna give up, the thought of my family finding me or having to plan my funeral terrifies me. 

I’ve reached a point where I don’t think I can keep holding on for them. I don’t want to keep disappointing them. I’m exhausted. I’m tired of daily panic attacks, I’m tired of pretending to be okay to friends and co-workers, I’m tired of trying different medications, I’m tired of trying talk therapy, I’m fucking tired. 

I’m going to set a date for a few months from now. (It’s very hot where I live, I fear if I’m not found right away my body will decompose much faster/smell in the heat, waiting for the cooler season seems more considerate to whomever finds me) My family is and always has been very poor. I want to save the money for my own funeral so they don’t have to worry about that. I recently moved a fair distance from my family, this comforts me that they won’t be the ones to discover me.

SuicideWatch,"I want to start by first apologizing about the fact that my grammar sucks, and that this will be long. I'm obviously using a throw away. This is stuff that I have never told anyone, not friends, Family, or even my Fiance after years of dating. 

On the outside it would seem that I have a great life, I have an awesome job and a companion who actually loves me, but I'm heavily considering ending my life. When I was a child (around 3ish?) my Father and Mother were severe drug addicts. Abuse was a normal part of life in all forms. I was beaten, drowned, and molested by both of them. I had my teeth knocked out, bones broken, and anal damage from good ole dad. My Sister who is older had it even worse. When the state finally got involved they sent dad to prison and mom went on the run for 20 years, Sis and I were split up into foster care and adopted out. I was out of the direct fire because my foster parents were actually very good people but others in our community were not. When I was around 9 i started being molested again by a woman we knew from our church. She taught me most of what I know about sex and of course at the time I didn't know how wrong it was. One of her friends also dabbled in it as well though not as often. By 13 I was having severe attitude issues which ended up with me going to a long term housing institution for troubled youth.  They flew a Christian flag but violence against the kids in their care was pretty common as was sexual abuse. It seemed like being a victim of sexual and physical abuse made me and others even bigger targets. I was finally released at 18 and did everything I could to be the best person I could, to prove that I was above all the garbage I had endured. I put myself through college, got a great job and thought I was on my way to a great life until I ruined it. I started playing an online game that's a lot like the sims but you play with other people not AIs and I ended up using a child avatar. One thing led to another and I ended up being involved in a circle of mostly women who liked to call me their ""son"" or neighbor, or some other family member and they would do all sorts of sexual stuff with me as the ""young innocent one"". At first I hated people like that and would report them but as time went on I went along with one and ended up being more turned on than I had in a long, long time, which is how I ended up in that circle of them. I want to make it clear that minors, in no way arouse me, what i found arousing was the older women who saw me as a child and did those things to and with me. I ended up getting an email from the mods of the game saying I was being invetigated for ageplay and was of course banned. Now I'm living with the horrific feeling that I have been just as evil as the sick fucks from my own childhood as well as the unbearable fear that the police will knock at any time to take me to jail for my actions and that everything will come out. Even though everyone involved was way over 18 i know some law had to be broken. I'm terrified I'm going to jail, terrified I'll have to register for the rest of my life.  Terrified I'll loose my career, my fiance, and my friends. Part of me wants to get in my car and drive until i can't anymore and abandon everything, and part of me really wants to just eat a bullet and be done with everything. Call me what you want, call me the monster that I've become, tell me how worthless I am. I just had to let it out.

SuicideWatch,"It's been years and years and years since I thought about this.  I have bipolar but been medicated for years now and everything was going great until:

1. My husband and I after 10 years is finally deciding on divorce. This isn't very ugly though! We've already been seeing other people, we agreed that this should happen, we also agree on what we both get. We've become better friends than spouses and for years we fought and fought and fought. I got blamed for everything!
2. I'm moving out on my own again, after 10 years! This is scary enough.  If you've been married for a very long time and then went out on your own, you get this. Suddenly everything is on your shoulders again and you don't have that extra help that you know you've had.
3. The man I've been seeing for about a year now is all of a sudden being a JERK! So apparently my husband texted him because he was worried about my depression. I admit I'm starting the isolation again, heavier rock music I'm listening to, etc. He wanted to see if maybe my other guy knew what was going on.  I GET BLAMED FOR MY SOON TO BE EX TEXTED HIM! OVER THAT! He said not another time, I can't and won't do it.  Like I freaking hold a gun to my soon to be ex's head and say text him!  Also he just seems distant and when I tell him what's going on lately, he doesn't really get into it ya know? He doesn't really act concerned. He says he worries about me......well then freaking talk to me about it! Ask questions!  My brain even says if ya end it maybe he would finally get the point! I know deep down he wouldn't want me to do that though.
4. My mother has dementia and after 7 years I'm still taking care of her!

I've been telling people I'm fine, I'm ok, everything is going great.....except to a very few close friends. Those friends know about the suicidal feelings, know what's going on, and 1 of them are about ready to kill both of my men.  I try to just shake it off. The other night I drank just to be happy again! I don't drink but I was at the end of my rope! I didn't care anymore and really don't.  I drank to just be happy and then eventually ya know got tired and went to bed.

SuicideWatch,"this is gonna be kind of long and ramble-y but i’ll try and put a tldr at the bottom 

i’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since i was probably 13 or 14 (currently 18m) but i always thought about suicide in the past in a negative/sad context, like i was having some sort of breakdown and i had these impulses to try and do something drastic and dangerous, and that’s what i’ve come to recognize in my head as feeling suicidal and needing to reach out for help. What i’ve been feeling recently has been different. It’s been more of an existential crisis where i’m just wondering what the point of all this is? the universe is so big and endless and we are so small, my conscious would just cease to exist and life on earth would continue. I just can’t help but feel like it’s not that big of a deal. i don’t want to go to work, i don’t have much interest in eating or my relationships or doing anything at all. This might just be influenced by this pandemic and I am still working, it’s been so stressful and playing a really big role in my mental health and stress/anxiety. it’s such a weird, simple, apathetic, tired “i could just do it and then i won’t have to go to work/deal with it anymore” 

tldr: i’m used to feeling sad when i feel suicidal, but lately i’m like an exhausted secondhand suicidal where i’m not going to actively try to commit suicide and i don’t necessarily want to die, but it’s just something that’s constantly on the front of my mind as an option, and i just feel very apathetic/empty.

SuicideWatch,"Hello, I reached out on this platform and a few other subs a couple months back. Here is my post. You can see in my post history that I posted it in several subs. I really didn’t think anyone would respond to me so I tried to put it in front of as many eyes as I could. I’ll do the same with this post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f18zg2/please_read_me_i_did_terrible_things_when_i_was_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I didn’t expect to get so much attention and replies. I am eternally grateful for the support and advice I received. And I apologize I didn’t respond to everyone. Trying to work through this gives me really bad anxiety, to the point where I tremble and vomit. 

I still hate my self and still can’t forgive my self. I feel now that my only option to move forward is I have to reach out to these girls and apologize. For the last couple of months I have been looking for them. I made a blank Facebook to try and find them, I was able to find 3 of the 4 pretty easily. For the one who I didn’t remember her name (CB), I went on a dudes Facebook who I knew befriended every person he could and looked through everyone of his 2,000 plus friends and looked at their faces to see if I could find her, and what do you know, I did. 

I will use the code names from my previous post to identify the girls. LC and CB are now married, and CB has 3 children. Also CB is an kinda a conspiracy theorist and her profile is filled with the deep state and Bill Gates is putting tracking chips in us, the works. That makes me nervous reaching out to her. LC is happily married and I’m hesitant to reach out because what if she has already moved on, and my message will bring back traumatic memories. 

Though I haven’t been able to find the 4th, DL, until I get a random call. I get robo calls but not often and no one talks to me anymore, so it’s highly unusual for me to get a call. I don’t know why but I answered this one and when she realized she called me, I could hear the anxiety and fear in her voice. And that’s when I knew it was her. It’s been over 10 years and she still has my number and I can tell what I did haunts her. For a recap she is the one who I met a dance party and while making out I put my hand in her pants without her permission. There is a lot more details about the incident in my previous post. She is also a Mormon. She is happily married with children and has become friends with some of the people I was friends with while in high school. 

Back to the call, she just said she had the wrong number and hung up. Though now that I had her phone number I was able to find her name on google and then her on Facebook. Seeing her face, I know it’s her and I’ve now got the chance to apologize to all my victims. I know I could call or text her, but I don’t feel like that is as appropriate because I’m sure my apology will be a couple thousand words and I don’t want to call because that doesn’t give me the chance to really format what I want to say. 

But I’m stuck in this step now. Every time I try to write out what I want to say my anxiety gets so bad that I shake uncontrollably. My perception is clouded with fear and self hatred. I’m afraid I can’t think rationally enough to compose a sincere apology letter.

I am so afraid that they will admit what I did traumatized them, and I don’t think I can live with my self knowing that. I have only suspected that and it was enough for me to want to put a gun to my chest. I’m also afraid that when I do they will use it as proof and oust me, which honestly I don’t want to happen, but that’s their right and I cannot object to that. If that’s what they feel like they have to do, then I have to support them. They are the victims here, not me. 

When I’m ousted I’m afraid of my friends and families reactions. I have been under the impression that if they knew the truth about what I had done they would understand why I had to kill my self. I’m also afraid that their rejection will push me over the edge of suicide. 

As of now I know I’m too much of a coward to kill my self, I’ve been there, tried that and I couldn’t do it. I love the idea and beauty of life but absolutely hate my self. I cannot continue like this or with my self if I don’t reach out. The way I’m living now is miserable, I want to move on but can’t.

I know this is about me, this is about me wanting to move forward, which is wrong and selfish. It needs to be about them, about what I did to them, how it was wrong and about apologizing to them. 

I don’t want to tell them that I am suffering because I don’t want them to feel at blame. Most of them are apart of the Mormon church and the church hasn’t always handled sexual assault and rape very well. From other Mormon rape victims testimonies, the church would rather suppress these incidents as the blame is sometimes moved to the women. 

But I also feel like if they knew how much I have suffered they would know my apology is sincere and would be more inclined to forgive me. But that right there is wrong. I feel like that is me using my suicide as a guilt trip for their more likely forgiveness. 

I am probably the most terrified that she will confirm what I had done traumatized her and caused her a lot of pain. I think that will give me the push and courage I need to actually go through with killing my self. But I don’t want to kill my self, I don’t want my life to end, but I don’t think I’ll be able to live with my self or with the rejection of my friends and family.
 
I would really appreciate any feedback or advice you can give me about how I can format it.

What my mind tells me is to try and make everything about them, not reveal any of my suffering and purely make my apology about what I did to them and how it was wrong.

But, my anxiety tells me to share my suffering with them so they understand that I am sincere and make them more likely to forgive me. But like I said earlier, that’s wrong and manipulative. 

Also, my suffering might bring them satisfaction as I have caused them trauma. But that, I would understand and be okay with that. 

But in reality, I am in no way able to think straight or rationally. My anxiety is out of control and I cannot get my self out of this depressive pit I’ve dug my self into. My existence is miserable and I don’t want to live like this anymore. That’s why I need your help and guidance.

I am a mistake, My existence is worthless.

Waking up is toture, or as close as it can be. Sleep for me is not a way to feel refreshed the next day. Rather, it is a cruel biological trick that makes me long for death itself. It is the middle ground between existence and non-existence. 

Growing up has been a bad dream. My parents losing everything because of a man who wouldn’t pay; my sister, being sexually assaulted and questioning herself endlessly, and finding that I am damned to spend decades in life. In a world so broken, and so confused that it would argue over the difference between up and down and which is better.

There is this fog that covers me everyday, while not actually something that can be seen, it can be felt. Any attempt to learn or do something new is constricted by this fog. I feel useless, I feel behind. My colleagues and friends seem like geniuses, yet I sit here struggling to absorb information. Even as I write, while I have the feelings and experiences, I can’t share them. They are trapped within me, to follow and taunt.

Many years now I have contemplated jumping out of a window, “accidentally” swallowing poison, or even hanging myself.

some things make me feel happy and giddy or whatever, but deep down i just feel like a husk. whatever emotion i have is temporary. nothing lasts forever. 

i’m never happy with how i look. my willpower to change isn’t constant, it just spikes and crashes over and over and over again. why should i even care about how i look? it’s not like there’s any point in trying to impress people

SuicideWatch,"The lowest of it.
This whole entire time, simply my existence causes suffering, and pain, and i am truly selfish for keeping myself here.
I have always looked at suicide as a duty i needed to fulfill. I knew i would have to do it, it was practically set in stone and a matter of time.
I have gotten all the help in the books, facilities to therapy to ECT, They shouldve known you cant bring a dead person back to life.
Ive always been completely alone, no acquaintances, one abusive relationship, my whole family has turned against me. As a result, i cling and get over attatched to people who want nothing to do with me.

SuicideWatch,"I wrote an analogy of how I perceive my own depression and suicidal tendencies. I hope it can resonate with some of you, you’re never alone. Happy Mental Health Awareness Month ❤️❤️:


You’re sitting in a room devoid of all color. It isn’t even black necessarily, it’s somehow darker and it suffocates you. This room doesn’t shut the fuck up either, it’s constantly yelling at you and reminding you about past mistakes and how big of a fuck up you are. You yell and pound on the walls but it’s no use. The room is inescapable. There’s one window in the room and if you look out it you see your loved ones. Some are staring at you, wondering why you’re having such trouble getting out of this room. Some completely ignore your plea for help. No one tries to break you out of this room, they just watch you in there. The world around you starts to collapse and death appears in your room with you, takes you by the hand and you disappear. Suddenly the room unlocks and everyone comes flooding in looking for you, wondering what they could’ve done to prevent this from happening. They show the love for you that you deserved when you were still in the room, but now you’re gone. Anything was worth it just to escape that room.","The Cold, Dark Room",t3_gt69wv,1

SuicideWatch,"I should preface this with the fact that while I have intense and often overwhelming suicidal ideations, I want to live so badly. I want to love so badly that it hurts deep in my soul. I’ve been suffering from depression for about... going on 12 years now. My 20th birthday was last month and I’ve been going to college at my local university, but I had a bad semester. Probably the worst rut of depression I’ve ever had without being suicidal. I just... deteriorated. I watched myself die a little more every day. Stopped eating, going to classes, bathing was a struggle, even if I turned off the light for comfort. I just wanted to... I didn’t want to die, exactly? But to just... cease. To suddenly not exist. To sleep one night and never wake up. That was the general day to day. 

My father snapped one day. Came to my college dorms and got in my face in the front office. Grabbed my shirt and smacked my hat off my head while confiscating my phone and my car keys (I paid for my own car on the by and by.) Told me I was cut off from my family. Told me that he wasn’t going to live with a son like me. 

I made a bad move after that. I didn’t realize it at the time but hindsight is 20/20. I told myself: If I’m not a part of the family anymore, then he doesn’t need any of the things left at his house that are mine. I got a buddy to drive me to my fathers house and I gathered some of the things that were important to me. An old briefcase I inherited from my grandfather and some of my clothes was really all it amounted to. 

He attacked me on sight. Grabbed me, threw me into a wall, tried to hit me. I’m proud and slightly terrified to say that I have more than I got. I’ve never been in a real fight. But I left with a busied back and beat up arms. My throat had a handprint on it. I don’t like it when people touch my neck anymore. I don’t like it when people grab me. 

I scrambled away, while my dad yelled out:
“If I see you near my house again, I’ll kill you.” 

I should have called the police. I should have done something other than just take it and run. Fast forward a year. It’s 2020 and I’m starting to get myself together again. But college is expensive and due to my rough semester I lost my honors scholarship. I can afford student housing anymore. My father house is my only option, and like an idiot, I take it. My father doesn’t hit me, but god.

I’ve never wanted to die, but I’m getting close and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m not asking for anything, I just want someone to make me feel like they understand.",Just wanted to put my words somewhere. Thank you for your time.,t3_gt6ylw,1
SuicideWatch,"Im 16
I’ve had depression for a long time, since around 6th grade. My parents have tried to “help me” but whatever they do it feels like they do it for themselves and not for me. The therapy was about family dynamic  or some other bullshit like that. I’m seriously contemplating suicide and have no clue what to do. I don’t want to die but I feel like I have no other option. Everything I do feels like i’m doing it wrong, all my friends basically ditched me and I have nothing to look forward to. I have no ideas on how to cope or help myself, I don’t feel like I can ask my parents either. Everyday I just feel so alone. This year what really made me even more depressed is quiting a sport I loved doing because I felt like I was falling behind. I loved that sport with every bone in my body and fucked it all up because of how I was feeling at the time. It’s not a sport I can get back into either, A few weeks out of it and you loose everything you worked towards. I’m not sure where to start but I just need someone to help me. This is a throwaway.",I don’t know what to do,t3_gt6r03,1
SuicideWatch,"I don't know what I am doing here. I don't want to kill myself. Not really. I love the world. There are things I want to learn. Achieve. But the thought of dying is less upsetting than the thought of going grocery shopping tomorrow. I'm not in pain. I'm just tired. 


If there is a limit to how much can a person bear in a lifetime, I feel like I am past that. Now I am comfortable saying that my childhood was messed up. If you've heard of ACEs (adverse childhood experiences), my score is 7 out of 10. I'm including it for reference. Feelings are nice and all, but a scale is a scale. But really, I've been broken over and over again.


I've believed in healing. Dedicated the past ten years to that. But I feel like I've used up everything I've been left with. The world presses and demands and I can't reach. Still I'm held back by the demons of my past. I've had opportunities. I fell apart trying to take them. My fault, certainly, at this age I should be able to live an adult's life. I just break under the strain.


Recently a lot has happened. I've had a... resurgence of a new batch of some very early memories. I've known the things happened, I just didn't remember. It's upsetting. I keep having what my therapist calls emotional flashbacks, I sometimes forget reality completely and I'm just a child alone with the terror and can't snap back. My partner was always a huge source of comfort through everything, but now he says he's unhappy. He's taken back many of our future plans that were underway. He wants us to work on the relationship. The love and affection is there, it's just the patterns we've gotten stuck in. I do want it too, I want him to be happy and it would be better for me too. I agree that there are some parts of it that are toxic to both of us. It just seems there's so little left of me.


I just want to sleep for a hundred years. But the world won't stop turning. The more I postpone things, the harder they press. I just... I don't know. I just want to have never existed... Disappear into nothingness. Sort of like when it's too much and the world stops feeling real. Even the smallest things feel like too much... 


I don't know. I want to share this and talk about it with someone who won't freak out. People are so quick to freak out over these things. I just need... someone to hold me and have him understand how much I'm currently struggling...",I don't think I have any strength left,t3_gt6qyt,1

I haven't taken care of myself for as many years.

There's no point in it if I could be dead the next month.

I'm alive through sheer procrastination.

I've believed for a long time that if something else doesn't take me, I'll end up killing myself.

My destiny lies at the end of a barrel, the edge of a blade, or the bottom of a pill bottle.

I grew up to be a statistic.

That is all I'll ever be.

I'm worthess.

I'm anxious.

I'm depressed.

And most of all,

I'm a liar.

I'm a liar to the parents who care about me. I'm their only child, they are far past their prime to have any more. If I pass, it signifies their failure. 

If I pass it's not only me who will die.

My mother said if I go she goes.

I'm trapped and I hate it.

I lie and say that I'm fine.

Things are getting better.

I'm doing well.

Lies.

Lies.

Lies.

I lie like it's second nature because mom doesn't want to hear the bad and dad just gets angry.

I know one day I just won't care anymore.

One day I'll go past all the safety nets I've set for myself and just splatter on the concrete.

I almost killed myself during a fit last month, though one of my safety nets caught me.

I don't know if it could be viewed as lucky.

I've had a decade of therapy as well.

I'm a functional member of society as a result.

I have a car.

I have a job.

I go to college.

It feels like a facade.

I'm broken and lie that I'm put together every single day.

Even on good days, I consider dying.

I imagine it frequently, at least once a day.

I feel pure happiness at the thought of being blessed with a terminal illness.

Its like seeing a puppy chase a butterfly, the feeling that thoughts of my own death bring me.

Of course, I go through the motions to protect others.

I drive safely.

I'm careful of infectious disease.

I can't let myself become so apathetic that my own want of an end endangers others.

I try to fill the time with meaningless hobbies.

I paint, I bake, I carve, I sculpt, I try to create to fill the void.

The void that is procrastination.

I will end my life one day if something else doesn't take me first.

It could be next month, next year, a decade from now.

SuicideWatch,"So I ordered a few more books, I’m currently reading “Red White &amp; Royal Blue”, a gay love story between the First Female President’s Mexican son and the Prince of England. It’s fucking great, honestly.

So basically, Alex’s (Mexican guy) divorced parents get into a fight and he calls up Henry (the Prince, duh) to tell him about it and he says that he did his best to handle the argument and then the book goes on to say;

“Alex forgets what he was going to say next.

He just... Well, he gets told he’s great a lot. He just doesn’t get told he’s good enough.”

I had a small epiphany when I read those lines. I hate it when people say “I wish I were you” or “I want to be like you”, especially since they know me an such a basic and superficial level, it’s disheartening to hear that. But now I realized one of the reasons behind that.

Nobody looks at the process behind what I make. Nobody sees me when I throw up in the mornings when I go to school because my anxiety is eating me alive. Nobody sees when I scratch my arms open from frustration when I can’t draw the way I want to. Nobody hears the way I pray to anyone who is listening to take my soul so my family doesn’t have to deal with having lost someone to suicide.

They just see the 10’s on my tests, the finished drawing I upload to the Internet and how I always say “good morning” with the best smile I have to offer.

They tell me I’m great, but not enough. I’ve been feeding people what I have to offer yet they still want more, waiting for me to get 11’s on my tests, waiting for a painting that would put DaVinci to shame. Waiting for me to be happy.

And I can’t give anything more, I try so hard that my guts are crawling up my throat with dread every time I wake up.

SuicideWatch,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t.

(She doesn't purchase her foods that are good for her situation, and only buys her sugar free sodas... which is the quickest way to kill a diabetic :/ ) As a result of this poor management, she is constantly in chronic pain. 

Through many drunken talks, she has expressed that she no longer sees any point in living, and I don't know what to do. She's told me that she has a date, and that she has a plan. 

Last night she shared with me that she makes plans with me for our future once we get out of high school and leave this POS town, but doesn't actually see herself living long enough to get there. No matter what I say, she doesn't listen. I know she's in a terrible, dark place, but I don't want to lose her. I can't lose her. 

I want her to be there when we're able to move out, I want her to be there for every milestone in our lives. None of this matters to her... she genuinely thinks she has nothing to live for. She tells me that I'm a lot smarter than her and have the ability to do a LOT of things, but she doesn't see that she does too. She hasn't even got out of high school, she has no idea how much can happen after that... 

She was diagnosed with PTSD, was about to be diagnosed with BPD and was put on heavy antidepressants following a suicide attempt. (??, I'm not sure if they were antidepressants but whatever it was made her a lot more inspired to do stuff. She got her mom and sister out of a very stressful situation, finally making her mom see that moving out of their abusive grandmother's house would be the best option for them.) 

Her mom has since pulled her out of any and all services, which has left her without the medication. Her mom doesn't believe in mental illnesses and is extremely unstable, borderline crazy. 

I'm terribly worried about her, and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help, I don't even know how to approach this situation. Anything I say proves to be useless, but I really, really want to help her...

If anyone could give me some kind of idea as to how to help, that would be amazing. I really, really think she needs to get back into the services, but I don't think her mom will EVER do that... she'd have to wait til she's 18 to get herself in, but I don't know if she can wait that long.",How to Save a Life?,t3_gt2yiu,1

SuicideWatch,"I was always the kind of kid who was in control of life, or so it seemed. By 12 I had been on TV multiple times for my fundraising activities that set records for kids lead efforts. I worked briefly as an informant for the RCMP and then CSIS after being busted for designing a new class of phone phraeaking software. I started my first company at 16 and sold it at 19, mainly because my partner had decided to move to the US. I worked a lot of different jobs as a teen trying to find my way. My teachers gave me As not to show up because they were afraid of me correcting them or making them look foolish.

I graduated highschool with excellent grades even though I held the school record for skipped classes and literally never opened a textbook.  I paid my own way through university undergrad and grad, ending up with a BA (Political Science and Public Policy), and then completed a joint LLB/MBA program. I passed the bar and obtained my CGA, and later CPA. Because of my first job I also persued and obtained my CIA and CFE. I've been an expert witness in court. After some time as an auditor I moved into lower management, and then quickly rose through the ranks spending most of my working years earning $100-150,000/year plus cooshy benefits. I even ended up a union boss for a while. All sounds good right? Everyone thought so. And for brief moments I was happy.  

It was always there in the background though. I always had to fight to be happy. I had to pretend I felt like other people did so I didn't seem odd. I would be happy and then go dead inside for no reason. I would question any source of happiness and sometimes push it away before it could betray me. I found my only joy by having a purpose. By making my company better. By improving the lives of my friends and coworkers. By having friends and family that cared about me.  

My first real live in girlfriend made me happy but I always knew she would leave me.  Maybe that came through in my actions but in the end she cheated and it ended badly.

Then I found a woman who brought me back to my heritage and I found great comfort in that. I had a child who quite to my surprise made me truly understand what it was to be happy for the first time. Combined with my daughter I actually had a year or two when everything seemed to go right, when i was finally happy for real. I started going to shule, I started working out again, i was back to the fitness of my youth and felt google. I actually believed my life would work out.  I was actually proud of who I was and I saw a future that was good.

Then it all fell apart. My marriage turned very bad quickly. I wasn't want she wanted, I was what she though she should have. The lingering doubts and depression return, my work suffered, I tried to take some sick to on my doctor's advice to straighten it out and less than a month back at work I got a new boss who fired me without cause because ""she couldn't trust someone who had gone on sick leave to lead the business"". I walked out the door crushed but with a huge golden parachute so I figured I'd land ok, I literally had years to find something.

That's when my wife filed for divorce. That's when I completely fell apart. Within 2 years I was still jobless, divorced, only seeing my daughter part time, emotionally crippled, I had lost most of my friends either because they couldn't deal with my depression or because they never were more than work acquaintances. I had also returned to the disordered eating of my life and gained 200lbs becoming morbidly obese, damaging my self confidence, my health, and my ability to present well at interviews.  

I was ready to kill myself and then I saw some stupid youtube video about a little girl saying goodbye to the daddy she lad lost to illness and I fell apart. I called my psychiatrist, told them everything, and ended up locked up. I had already undergone multiple drug treatments and been deemed ""treatment resistant"", and had undergone some unproven magnetic therapy that was in trial, still no effect. So, once they locked me up they went all out and went to electro shock therapy. It was awful. Some people feel nothing but I experienced horrid pain every time. Still i stuck with it until the day when I woke up surrounded by doctors and nurses instead of in the normal recovery room. They told me I died on the table. The psychiatrist wanted to take it up a notch and try again with dual brain electroshock (they were just doing one side) but the anesthesiologist said there was a high chance I'd die if I went under again. I was scared so I said no more electroshock. The doctor was mad and discharged me. I later found out he wrong 'dead man walking' in his notes and he said he anticipated I would follow through on my suicide within a year. In retrospect I should have let him try, I’d either be better or dead and either is better than what I am. Based on this my own psychiatrista of 2 years just quit.

Then some hope entered my life.  A psychologist who seemed to care.  I believed she cared.  I told her things I told no one.  I started to see a way out.  Then, my best friend of over 20 years betrayed me.  She admitted she had never seen me the same after seeing me in full breakdown in the hospital and seeing me at my worst she no longer thought I was a good person or a person worth being friends with.  Unfortunately she was also best friends with my psychologist (having recommended her to me) and within a couple weeks of my friend turning on me so did the doctor, refusing to see me anymore.

And then someone, maybe my ex friend, filed false allegations neglect and of physical and sexual abuse of my daughter. It took 6 months for that to go away and during that time I was afraid of every hug I gave my daughter, my only reason to live. She didn’t understand and has never been as close to me ever since.   She used to love to give me hugs and cuddles and after they are gone.  

Every single day is a struggle to live. I don’t want to die really but I can’t stand the every day pain of living. I really didn’t want to abandon my daughter though, I know how hard that is on kids so that’s my only reason to get up in the morning.   I wanted to fight for her so I got myself together and started job hunting again.  I was doing well, a couple hours every day devoted to the search.  I got a few interviews, even a few second interviews, but no job.   I was still trying though and then Covid hit.  There is NOTHING out there in my field right now.  After weeks of looking I now find myself in the worst depression I’ve been in for a long time, maybe ever.    I have no hope for the future. I see no positive outcomes as possible.  I feel like all I am is a drain on the few people I have left in my life.  I don’t even feel like a decent father anymore because we can be in the middle of something fun and then suddenly I’m blank, I feel nothing for no reason and she sees it and it upsets her.   I don’t think she believes it isn’t her causing it.  

Recently I was away from her for 3 weeks due to a covid self isolation.  She barely seemed to care.   Maybe she doesn’t need me anymore.   And if she doesn’t, its my time.   I can’t continue to live like this.  I just can’t.  My life is mostly sadness and anger broken by brief minutes of happiness when I’m with her.   It’s not enough anymore. I can’t take it.   I had buried myself in hobbies to feel like I was doing something but now none of them matter, they make me sad. I was helping others online and that gave me some joy, but more and more often I find myself getting mean to these people who are just looking for help.  I can’t control myself anymore.

I have one real friend left and I’m pretty sure she has no idea what to make of me anymore.  I love her dearly but it seems I no longer can support her I am just there to drain her emotionally because of my problems.

I feel like a coward for not being dead yet.  I know that’s my future and the longer I stay only harms others more.  In two days my baby goes back to her mom.  The stores selling balloons are open again.  I think next week may be my time.

I’m not even sure why I’m writing this beyond knowing I’ve decided goodbye notes would only harm people I love more and I guess I needed to work this through and I have no one to talk to.  I cried through most writing this and now I’m oddly calm.   I think the decision is made.

SuicideWatch,"I’ll certainly die someday, if not by suicide. Why should I live a life of suffering if I must ultimately die? I have no real friends to speak of. I’m studying something which I now realise was a mistake. I’m unattractive. I have no real skills, and I forsook the one thing I was genuinely good at to study what I thought was my passion. The virus is poised to ruin my country. I won’t amount to anything much at all, I simply have no ambition. 

Even if I did, anything I would achieve would be ridiculously insignificant when you realise how staggeringly vast the universe is. There are 200 billion + galaxies out there. The existence, or lack of existence of a single mediocre human among all that makes absolutely no difference at all to the grand scheme of things.

There are 3 main reasons which have kept me from ending my life.

Firstly, I don’t want my parents discovering my corpse. They would be utterly destroyed. Of late though, what I said above about our insignificance has been weakening this argument. What does it matter if my death devastates them? Emotions are just some chemicals. An increase in the secretion of certain chemicals in 2 individuals in the universe is immaterial. I won’t be around to see it. And yet at the same time I hate myself for being so callous about basically the only 2 people who care for me.

Secondly, I’m afraid of how uncertain death is. What happens to my consciousness after I die? Does it get transferred to some other creature? Will I perhaps have to live again? I definitely won’t have any memory about this life though, so perhaps that will act as a reboot.

Lastly, I’m afraid of botching the process. The method I choose may fail. I’m afraid of being left a cripple.

SuicideWatch,"I am a 24 years old woman and I hate my life. I regularly have suicidal thoughts. This is my story. 

When I was on kindergarden, I had no friends. The other kids hated me and bullied me frequently. 

When I was in elementary school, I had no friends. I was regularly bullied and called ugly and a witch. There must be something in my behavior that rubs people the wrong way. Also, maybe I do look like a witch. I am pretty ugly and I have black hair. 

When I was in middle school, I found 2 friends, but they were pretty trashy and often made fun of me. I wanted to impress them, so I started having sex with random men, some of them much older than me. I didn't really like the sex, I just wanted to ""prove"" something. 

My friends eventually abandoned me. I was friendless again. In high school, I only had one friend, a nerdy girl who was also a bit of an outcast, but we were never very close. We were just too different. She was a good student and a teacher's pet, while I was kind of the ""trashy girl"" with a bad reputation. 

I went to university, but I got pretty depressed because I had no close friends and no real boyfriend. I stopped attending the classes for two years and my parents got mad at me. I eventually started attending class again and I'm finishing uni soon, but I keep thinking, what's the point. There must be something seriously wrong with me. I think that at this point, even if I did find some real friends, I still wouldn't be happy. Even if I did find a boyfriend, I still wouldn't be happy.",Why I hate my life. My story.,t3_gt0ffy,1

i was discharged by a psychiatric hospital 7 days ago and after talking with my aunt, therapist, and parents, I'm flying back up to New England to go back. I've been having constant passive SI and active SI  2 or three times in the past 5 days. I feel really ashamed to have to go back after so little time, and I know it's okay to need extra support but I feel like a burden to my friends and family. Additionally, I wrote a very long thank you letter to the staff on my unit and I'm almost embarrassed to go back after having written that later, which I know is very irrational but it's still bothering me a lot.

SuicideWatch,"It's been over a week since I tried to take my life. My ex spouse called the cops on me because I was drunk and angry and she called them when I didn't respond to her message. I'm 28 and we have 3 kids together. Since I was 19 my life fell through the bottom. Made a mistake and caught myself a felony. I was in the military at the time and they gave me a general under honorable conditions article 15(discharge). I had been in for 2 and 1/2 years. Never wanted to do anything else with my life. Never cared for anything else in my life because I'm not a materialistic pig, which is how I see most people...well just about everyone.Anyway, I was put on probation for 10 years in april 2012. Ever since I was put on probation my life has been shit. It is just about impossible for me to get a job. I've applied at so many different places over the years only to be shot down in fucking flames. My entire family turned their backs on me, all my friends turned their backs on me and now my spouse has given up on me too. So now in the near future if I don't end my life I will end up homeless. CPS would never give me custody of my kids even if I was able to find a job to pay the bill. I did have a job in construction for 3 years but the car I had took a shit on me and they fired me for lack of reliable transportation.So the point of all of this is because tomorrow I am going to try to end my life again.

I was angry that that fucking bitch intervened to be 100% honest. I spent a half day at the hospital then 3 more in the psych ward.

SuicideWatch,"I am a volunteer at a suicide prevention line. I just read a post in r/unpopularopinions that said how crappy suicide prevention lines are. That opinion seemed to be pretty popular (typical for that sub). That sucks! I really want to be better and I assure you, so does everyone else staffing these lines. Do you have any suggestions on how to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my limitations:

\- The line is staffed by trained volunteers, not by mental health professionals. There are professionals on staff and they sit in the room with several volunteers while volunteers take calls. They listen in to random calls and we can call them over if we have questions or think a call is particularly acute. That way there is professional oversight while volunteers do the leg work

\- The line is not supposed to be therapy. In fact, we are discouraged from letting the conversation veer into ""therapy"" territory. The reason for this is 1) we don't want people relying on us for therapy and 2) we don't have the time or professional skills to guide someone out of the trauma space that therapy can guide you into. We do, however, refer people to therapy liberally and have all sorts of resources to help them access that.

\- There are almost always callers waiting in the queue. On one hand, it sucks to rush someone through their call. But on the other hand, other people are waiting. It's a trick to balance that. Like any public mental health agency, we are underfunded and short staffed/volunteered.

SuicideWatch,"Need to go on a little rant here about how unfair life has treated me. Both my parents were extreme alcoholics. I faced abuse growing up as a little kind almost daily. In 2nd grade my parents split up and I went to live with my mom. In the 3rd grade my mother beat me to a pretty extreme level and got arrested and went to jail. At that point in time I went to live with my grandma and father. I wasn’t behaving correctly so then I moved to my aunts and uncles in the 7th grade. In the 8th grade they accused me of stealing money that I did not do and sent me to a boarding school for almost 9 months. It was a living hell there. Fights almost everyday, I saw rape at first hand. I almost got raped but I was able to get the guy down on the ground and step my foot right on his throat and after that I really never got fucked with. That place really messed me up mentally. Finally when I made it back home I went to live with my grandma and my father. At the age of 17 I had to drop out of school to help take care of the bills around the house because my father was sick. I had lost my job and I started doing prescription fraud and got caught and was arrested. That same year I got caught with a dab pen and they sent it to a lab and I had finally recently been put on probation for it. At the end of 2017 my father had passed away from cirrhosis of the liver. Me and him became really close. He was like my best-friend and the one I always talked to and hung out with talked to and hung out late and watched movies and smoked and drank with. I was extremely close to him. It was a quick death. Happened within 2 weeks of us knowing he was sick. It has hurt me mentally a lot. That next year my mother passed away. We had started to repair our relationship so that was pretty devastating as well. Recently within the first month of my probation for my dab pen, I got charged for domestic violence because apparently me and my sister got into a fight. That means I had violated my probation so I’m probably going to go to prison soon. And worst of all my sister doesn’t give a rats ass about me. She has always disliked me because she and mom were close and when She got sent to jail she thought it was my fault when I had to go  info a hospital after she beat me.

SuicideWatch,"Long and short of it is former friends have told me they don’t care if I kill myself. That I’m evil and pathetic like my father who killed himself. That I’m a disgusting hypocrite for considering killing myself, because I resent my dad for killing himself. Well let’s test that theory. Shall we, boys? I was recently kicked out of our fraternity, and out of spite I reported the chapter for illegal behavior culminating in it being shut down. I know I shouldn’t have done that, but I was so hurt by them abandoning me. The fraternity was the only family I had left and they abandoned me. In fact the two guys I was closest to and trusted most are the ones who spearheaded the plotting and scheming to remove me. One of them (my little brother) has compared this act to being a coward Nazi who swallows cyanide to avoid judgement day. I know I hurt him by taking the fraternity from him and bringing shame to our family tree. So I get it. But that doesn’t change that he has deliberately done things that hurt me.

Since losing the fraternity I’ve self destructed. I’ve attempted to kill my self multiple times. I’ve been put on a 24 hour hold at a psych er. I’ve let physical health matters progress by delaying or completely refusing treatment (I’ve refused to schedule a surgical procedure I need basically using it as my trump card suicide method). I’ve descended into absurd levels of poly drug use. I’ve completely destroyed my life. Yesterday I lost a really good job being given the option to resign or be fired. I had gone awol and ignored my boss’s calls for awhile until HR called me.

I’ve begged these two guys to please reconsider and help me because I don’t have anyone else. They have refused. Literally telling me to go fuck myself and I’ve made my own hell. They have abandoned me, watched me lose my mind, and doubled down on the behaviors contributing to my mental decompensation.

Yesterday, after losing my job I begged them to please help me stop self destructing. My little brother’s response was:

“Well, you have certainly created your own hell and you have no one except yourself to blame for it this time around.

When people fuck up, the least they can do is clean up the mess they’ve made. Everyone fucks up. What differentiates you from the rest is that you don’t clean up the mess you’ve made, you smear it all over and do everything in your power to blame external factors for your own actions. 

I will not talk to you. I never want to talk to you regardless of if you’re alive or not. Revealing these intentions to me doesn’t help your case. That doesn’t mean your life is destroyed and that you cannot fix the damage you’ve done by doing better things with your life independent of me. People move apart and grow apart naturally or as a result of other factors, and being able to accept that is something you cannot seem to deal with. Furthermore, I don’t have respect for people who take the easy way out in life, a recurring pattern for you at this point. I can’t stop you from doing anything to yourself, nor can I stomp out your desires. But I can let you go to the grave with the thought that you’re a dark stain in my life as well as that of the chapter and all those associated with it. When it came time to face the damage, you jumped ship. What a man. I’d liken you to the Nazi pussies that bit a cyanide pill rather than see their judgement day.

You resent your father for the same thing that you intend to do and for that, you are a disgusting and selfish hypocrite.”

After I got that response from him, I sent him and the other guy I was close to (who just completely ignores me) an email totally snapping:

“It’s true that I was damaged before I met either of you. I’ve never denied that. I came to the chapter damaged, but not as a monster.

When you guys abandoned me and plotted against me for months (despite the fact I trusted you two more than anyone else in my life) you guys broke me. You shattered the foundation I had rebuilt my world on. I knew that my life was going to implode the second you guys started talking in the basement that night. That’s when I snapped and that’s when I turned into this disgusting, evil creature that I now am.

I had lost so much before I found the chapter. It replaced everything I had lost in my life. It filled every void. And it felt safe and secure until you guys took it from me rather than try to help me get better so I could be a good brother again. I didn’t just lose the chapter when you two took it from me. I lost my Huggie and my Papa and my dad all over again too. The chapter replaced them for me. And now I have nothing. And you guys didn’t care at all.

Think about how shell shocked I was the night you guys ripped the ground out from underneath me. How did you not realize how badly you were breaking me then and there? More important, how did you not care? How was I that worthless and discardable? I don’t understand why everyone treats me like I’m disposable. I’m not. I’m a real person who hurts. A lot. Not this caricature of manipulative evil that you branded me as. You guys just completely broke me and I haven’t recognized myself since that night. I literally look in the mirror and double take because I’m not sure it’s even me I’m looking at in the mirror anymore.

You guys took a damaged person and made me into a monster by destroying the last true bit of trust I held onto in the world. The way you guys attacked me and threw me under the bus without trying to intervene and help me see the light in a nonaggressive and nonthreatening way is what made me say “fuck it ,I want to see them hurt too.” If it had been literally anyone besides you two, I never would’ve reported. But it was you two. That’s what hurt me the most, not the abandonment from the chapter. But being abandoned by two guys who I considered my brothers. Who I still do consider my brothers somehow. You two were the masterminds of the whole shebang. You two made a conscious choice to abandon me and you both have admitted that to my face using the word abandoned. Nothing could have hurt me more in the world. Literally nothing. There isn’t any family I care about more than I cared about you two. And the worst part is you guys knew.

Why am I the only one who has to lie in a bed that was made? You guys could’ve stopped this so long ago if you would’ve offered emotional support and assistance on getting a collaborative treatment plan setup (sending police to the door is not at all a collaborative approach). You guys never offered to help me get treatment. Not once before it all blew up did anyone offer. All anyone did was repeatedly threaten to take away my entire life. But I was supposed to view what seemed an awful lot like attacks as help according to you guys’ world view. [name removed] got a supportive intervention from the chapter when he started to destroy his own world. I got attacked and kicked to the curb.

For months now you both have watched me descend into total insanity. And you’ve both done nothing except double down on doing the exact things that exacerbate the issues. And then you fault me for not reacting in a sane manner when I’m clearly losing my goddamn mind. Well let’s try to remember who is sane and who isn’t here. You guys are the sane ones so why do you keep doubling down on things that you know only make me lose it more? I swear you guys get a kick out of seeing me meltdown.

I never would’ve given up on you two if I saw either of you struggling to maintain a tenuous grasp on reality. Never. But you guys gave up on me. The people I thought genuinely cared about me the most gave up on me so easily. The people I factually cared about the most gave up on me.

Well fuck it. Because no matter what the two of you say, I know for a fact that it will fuck both of you up if I do it. You can deny it but the “what ifs” will always be in the back of your minds, the only way they won’t float back there for eternity and haunt you is if you’re both sociopaths and I know neither of you are.

So fuck you guys. I’m not even doing it out of fear or sadness anymore. I’m doing because I hope I haunt the fuck out of both of you. I hope it eats at you two until you’re both filled with stress ulcers from the thoughts. Undoubtedly you’ll both fair better than me as you both have access to quality mental healthcare because you both have good insurance. You guys have family that will help and support you. So good news is you both already have some leg ups that I didn’t. So you’re off to a head start there, boys.

You both could’ve stopped it but you both chose not to. You tell someone he’s evil and literally the equivalent of a Nazi coward and a pathetic failure like his father for long enough and he’ll start to internalize and accept it and act like it eventually. Especially if he’s already a broken person to begin with. I defined myself based off of what you two thought of me. I wasn’t a monster like this until you guys abandoned me. Enjoy reaping what you sowed. Especially you Brendan. I hope someone you trust dearly ignores your screams for help when your own mind starts to destroy you from the inside out. And trust me it will. I never thought I’d genuinely hope you experience the full strength of the emotional agony I live in. But in this moment I completely and totally hope you come to understand what you did to me and how you broke me.

I’m not sad or scared at this point. I’m gutted and pissed the fuck off. Fury is an apt descriptor. As you both know, sad me doesn’t act on his feelings, he covers them up with substances. Scared me makes threats and doesn’t follow through on them. Angry me follows through on what he says.

Fuck both of you. You guys don’t get to forget and move on that easy. I was promised a brotherhood that lasts for life. Not a brotherhood that lasts until it gets difficult. You guys cut and ran when the going got tough and yet you, Brendan, tell me I’m the quitter. You quit on me first.

YIT-go-fuck-yourselves. [reference to fraternity saying]”

Brendan, is my little brother in the fraternity. I would’ve taken a bullet for that guy. Still would if he’d let me back into his life, despite the plotting against me and how much he has hurt me. He’s my brother and you don’t give up on the people you love. Even if you hate them in the moment. I view him as my actual brother not my fraternity brother. He mattered more to me than my own mother (don’t get me started on her). I keep having this intrusive thought/urge to show up at his house. I know he’ll call the police. At which point I’ll either suicide by cop or blow my own brains out. I want to force him to witness the culmination of his abandonment. I want the mental image seared in his mind like the moment I found out he was the mastermind of my removal from the fraternity. I want it to haunt him and I hope he gets abandoned like me when his own mind starts to destroy him from the inside out.

A part of me says not to do this. That I do still care about these guys, especially my little brother. That no one deserves to be haunted like my dad’s suicide haunts me. Part of me says fuck them. My life is ruined because they abandoned me. And they even had admitted that they knew I would fall apart without the fraternity and they took my support system from me despite knowing it would ruin me.

I’m leaving the state for a day or two to put physical distance between my little bro and myself so that I have time to reconsider if I start driving back to execute my plan. But I know if I truly set myself to it I will go through with it.",Forcing someone to witness your death out of spite,t3_gt2atp,1

Attempted suicide at an early age, head injury, amnesia, had to start all over again. Low self esteem even though I've done some cool shit in my life.

Working in the same place for four years, just moved to a new department and had a chance to build something new. Was in a somewhat happy six month relationship. A dream project I had died recently but I was starting to overcome the loss. 
Working out, living with a roommate and about to move into an apartment I bought. 

Due to the pandemic, the relationship ended, two friends went into deep depression (one even attempted suicide) and I just fell apart. Couldn't work from home, work out, the social isolation just kicked me down. 
Pretty sure I forgot to take my antidepressants, stopped showering, shaving, eating right. Spent most of my time watching old movies, youtube (just to pass the time, not even enjoying any of it). 

Friends coworkers stopped calling, the manager still sends messages once in a while, asking how I am but I'm sure I'll get fired if this continues. 

My parents kept coming by, calling to make sure I took my pills. This morning they came by, decided they had enough and forced me to come back to thier place (my old room).

I have loose skin from losing 120 pounds and have breast with my sides sagging and stomach hanging loose. pretty much B cups. I can't wear clothes, I can't do anything normal such as swim, or exercise without my tits bouncing up and town and ending up in pain
I have arthritis in my shoulders, knee, elbows, wrists and feel immense pain daily.

SuicideWatch,"Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents. 

To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later) 

The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"". 
She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.

Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped.
Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")
Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old.
Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!)
Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams.
Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses.
Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"".
Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.

And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story. 

Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house. 
But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.

SuicideWatch,"Hey, everyone.

During these hard times of quarantine and self isolation, it is normal to get sad. That's just how human beings work, we crave for social contact. We are social animals, after all. Our brains evolved in order to live in society. But then, I realized something. I never sought for any kind of social interaction, you know. I've been living as if there were a pandemic going on for my entire life. I've been isolating myself for quite some time.

I mean, I believe I got plenty of reasons to do so, to be honest. I've always felt out of place, ever since I was a child. And as I grew older, the difference between me and other people around my age started to become bigger and bigger. People nowadays are quite superficial. They seek for superficial things, to satisfy their superficial pleasures. I have nothing against such behavior, who am I to decide what is right or wrong, after all? However, it is not a lifestyle I'm willing to follow, which is the reason why I don't have many friends. I've a got couple of them, I guess. Perhaps 3 good friends I could count on, perhaps less. There's no way to tell. All I know for sure is that I am a lonely guy, who's probably going to die alone and depressed. Pretty heavy stuff, huh?

I believe I've finally hit rock bottom. I feel like my life is bound to get worse and worse, but I can't find within myself the strength to avoid this fate. I cannot find the motivation to perform the most insignificant and simplest tasks. I cannot study, I just can't stand online classes, studying by myself, although effective, is a nightmare. For God's sake, I cannot bring myself to read books that I really, really like. I don't have the will to read a f\*cking book. I'm pathetic.

This is getting too extensive, and I don't want to be a nuisance to you all like I must be to everyone else in my life (or maybe I am too forgettable and insignificant to even be a burden to someone). To summarize: No one really likes me, and I'll likely die alone; I cannot bring myself to do anything useful, even if I like doing those things; I feel completely powerless before this situation, as if it's impossible to change my way of life.

I'd really appreciate some advice.",I think I need help...,t3_gt6gdv,1
SuicideWatch,"Hi All, 
I got a few private messages after my post and I’d like to say thanks for reaching out.
One thing that has kind of come up though that I thought might warrant a post of its own is the role that mental illness plays in suicidal ideation.
For me personally, I don’t have any mental illness. I have been to a doctor and to psychologists to check if I had developed any mental conditions which were causing me to have thoughts of suicide, and even tried antidepressants to check if it changed my thought processes. 
Turns out that although I am sad I don’t have depression. It is entirely understandable, and even expected, that someone in my situation feels sad. Unfortunately, I have lost the family and social connections and networks people normally have and since I can’t create more family or time then I am only left with working on acceptance of my situation. 
I’ve tried to be rational about it, I accept the situation and am not harbouring any delusions about the way my reality is. I have weighed up the pros and cons for me and have decided that that life just doesn’t offer any value for me into the future. That is how I have made my decision.

I’d be interested to hear if anyone else on here isn’t suffering from depression, anxiety, or other conditions. How have you reached your decision? Is it based on age, illness, boredom, financial reasons, or even just feeling like you have finished everything you want to do!",People don’t need to be mentally ill to want to end their life.,t3_gt307w,1
SuicideWatch,"I'm turning 30 in a few months. I've done enough for everyone else. Everything I love is being destroyed by covid. I wanted to travel, that was my whole life's goal. to see the world for what it was instead of just how america sees it. Now, impossible, unsafe. I have an autoimmune disorder so I've been in the house since late january when this all started. 

Food either sucks or my stomach rejects it. Sleep sucks, too many nightmares from being abused my whole life or pain from my idiot body. No friends, just people who use me when it suits them. Partner, but he's emotionally deaf to me. Job's gone, no one needs luxury industries in a pandemic. Apartment complex won't renew my lease so I'll probably be homeless as soon as they're allowed to evict people again. 

I'm in constant pain, my whole body is covered in sores that hurt and are disgusting. My joints are all fucked up. I have sex almost never and my whole job revolved around it for so long I got desensitized to it, so I can't even enjoy that anymore when i get over everything else and manage to try to do it. 

Everything that made me human has been taken from me. I wish I had done this to myself so I could at least feel like these feelings were unreasonable self hate. But honestly I've just been kicked, and kicked, and kicked, and I'm so tired of getting back up.

I left a note the gentlest way I possibly could. In a place he might never even find it, and that's ok. I'm deciding method, between a couple things, but my options are limited since I'm disabled and I might have to do something ugly. 

I don't honestly know why I'm posting here. I think maybe it's because I feel like I -need- to scream into the void one last time. I've never used reddit for anything before and I generally find it a breeding ground for bullshit. 

Everyone tells me to have hope, that things will get better. I have doctors, I have a therapist, I have people who ""take care"" of me but my life doesn't get better, it just gets worse. I can't tell if they're just not doing their job and I'm too stupid to notice or if I'm so abused I see even the worst doctor as ""hey, at least someone is even looking at my open wound"".  


Bottom line is, I want to die while I still remember who I was. Between mental illness, pain, beliefs being stripped from me, I'm slowly dwindling away and I don't like what's been left behind. I wish there was any other answer, any other escape from the constant pain, but I've tried everything. I've 100%'ed every video game I loved as a child, watched every movie that used to make me smile, read every book, listened to every scary story, hugged my dogs, tried eating good food all of which my body rejected,  but being trapped in this room for the rest of my life is too much to bear. 

I hope, whoever you are, you realize how good you have it. I hope to hug the people in your life - the only person I have to hug is someone who also slammed me into the ground in an airport parking lot. I hope you love your families, if you have them at all, because my mother raped me for 17 fucking years. I hope you enjoy a good meal once in a while, and try things you don't think you'd like, because between my 3 stomach disorders I can basically eat white rice and boiled chicken breast without severe pain. I hope you enjoy the sun, because I can't. I hope you take deep breaths, and calm yourself, because I can't.  I hope you enjoy your freedoms - knowing who you are, knowing what's going on around you, knowing what you need, and the power to change things - because I have none of those things.

SuicideWatch," Hey all. I'm going to try to be as brief and honest as I can.

I'm 17, male from swedan. I wanted to work in IT my whole life. I did an IT course last year and really disliked it, now I hate the thought of IT/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job. I quit my job in retail half way through last year, I was only working casually for some money but I had come to really, really hate it. I hated the idea of working, and I had nothing in mind for a job. In fact, I couldn't even IMAGINE a job where I would want to get out of bed and go to work, and I still can't to this day.

I started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression. It didn't do much. I upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg. This helped with anxiety, but I still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide. I tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things. Nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if I could play video games all day as a life I wouldn't be able to do it.

I'm going to be done pretty soon. I currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because I'm a student, and I have money to spend. My life is actually very great at the moment, yet I still want to commit suicide, because I'd rather feel nothing than feel negative (doesn't this seem obvious?) When school ends (in a few weeks) my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni. I am definitely not going to work, I'd rather die. I'm not going to go to uni with a student loan because I don't want to go through with it in the first place and I'm not going to force someone (the cosigner) to pay the loan back when I drop out or whatever.

So what are my options? Tolerate a life I hate or end my life. I think the answer is pretty obvious. I'm done with looking for things to improve my life, as I really doubt it's going to happen. I'm going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life.

I only have my kid here and when they are not at home I fall apart because I can only manage to keep it together when they are home, for them. I have amazing friends and an even more amazing boyfriend, but all in other countries, and I cannot see them. It's been nearly 4 months since I saw my bf, and I miss him a lot.

Nearly fell in a coma, but was rushed to hospital and they sorted me out. I know I am capable of it, but likewise I don't actually want to die, I just want things to be better. I cannot see a way to get better, or get my life into a place where it's liveable for me. I am doing everything I can, but not really getting anywhere. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for. I feel I can't open up to bf/friends/family as I don't want anyone to feel responsible if I were to off myself, and there is nothing they can do anyway since they are all so far away. I am scared to reach out to helplines or doctors here due to the fact I have a kid and they would not approve. It is a consequence that would make things a lot worse than they already are. I do get pills for depression that maybe will help at some point, but I am not very hopeful.","I'm trying so hard to fight this, but I'm not sure if I can. Don't know what to do.",t3_gt1jwg,1

* Full-time work makes me feel suicidal.
* All I think about in the past.
   * I’ve consistently thought about a specific youtuber every day from 2014 - now
   * I think about another one every day
   * I think about 3 others almost every day
   * I have an obsession with early British YouTube personalities
* All I do is think about my high school years
* I’ve been depressed and suicidal most of my life
* I don’t want to have kids because my mental health is fucked
* I peaked in high school
   * More social life
   * More purpose
   * More female attention

I want to:

* Live in the present
* Forget about the past
* Be happy

I’m thankful for the past experiences I’ve had, but I shouldn’t live there or have it dominate my present life.

SuicideWatch," 

Hey all. I'm going to try to be as brief and honest as I can.

I'm 17, male from swedan. I wanted to work in IT my whole life. I did an IT course last year and really disliked it, now I hate the thought of IT/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job. I quit my job in retail half way through last year, I was only working casually for some money but I had come to really, really hate it. I hated the idea of working, and I had nothing in mind for a job. In fact, I couldn't even IMAGINE a job where I would want to get out of bed and go to work, and I still can't to this day.

I started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression. It didn't do much. I upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg. This helped with anxiety, but I still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide. I tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things. Nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if I could play video games all day as a life I wouldn't be able to do it.

I'm going to be done pretty soon. I currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because I'm a student, and I have money to spend. My life is actually very great at the moment, yet I still want to commit suicide, because I'd rather feel nothing than feel negative (doesn't this seem obvious?) When school ends (in a few weeks) my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni. I am definitely not going to work, I'd rather die. I'm not going to go to uni with a student loan because I don't want to go through with it in the first place and I'm not going to force someone (the cosigner) to pay the loan back when I drop out or whatever.

So what are my options? Tolerate a life I hate or end my life. I think the answer is pretty obvious. I'm done with looking for things to improve my life, as I really doubt it's going to happen. I'm going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life.

University got a little better until I got raped when I was 18 and it left me with deep scars, mental trauma and harm. I suffered from anxiety, PTSD and depression, yet I kept pushing myself to keep going and maybe something in my life would be better.

Yet, this happened and sometimes I think that I brought this upon myself. That I deserve all this, because I’m a weak, selfish and insecure bastard. I don’t really deserve happiness but rather I deserve pain and suffering. I genuinely believe I deserve to suffer because I let everyone down and I just hate myself. I can’t look in mirrors because I’ll just recoil in disgust to who I see. 

When I get my punishment, I’m gonna end it. I’m gonna go to the trail near my house and end it by jumping. I deserve to die. I got nothing else left and maybe it would be better off if I just died.

I feel like the world is going to shit. Full of selfish people. I feel like even just the act of living in and of itself is selfish and evil. 
All I see in news is shit. Mindless, cruel, painful shit. Like George Floyd murder, and literal millions of other similar racist fueled hate crimes. Here where I live in Puerto Rico, 2 absolutely beautiful young women (that just so happened to be transgender) were both locked and burned alive in their own car because of 2 men that simply stated that they hated that the women were transgender. Again, along with millions of other news stories of other homophobic/transphobic hate fueled, disgusting crimes. I also have BPD and that alone might be enough for many to consider me ""evil, manipulative"" etc, and choose to avoid contact with me. I have a lot of suspected narcisissts in my family and have endured abuse, and still do endure it to this day. I feel like the world is just ruled by narcisissts and sociopaths and that any resistance or desire to change and bring positive change, is futile. I do not want to live in this nonsensical, harsh, terrible world anymore.

I plan on walking out to the mall that's right across the street after my grandparents have gone to bed tonight, and going all the way to the top floor of the parking garage. Then I shall find respite from such a senseless and morbid world in which I feel that my strong moral beliefs will never be satisfied in. I no longer care for my dreams to have a family and children and find true, genuine, unconditional love. These used to once be my biggest dreams... I think I will chase something else in the after life or whatever happens after destroying this flesh vessel. Maybe it'll just be one long empty space, of peace.

I dont plan to kill myself just yet but am very close to doing so.
Unlike other humans im not afraid to die nor will I go back on it either.

Its just that no matter what this world, this life seems to be going in cycles over and over.

They say bad things end sometime. Nothing lasts forever. Yet that can also be applied to good things too.
Nothing good lasts. In the end its just the good things that are left as memories to do what? Make you sad? ""Motivate"" you to keep living in this world people call life? This is hell.

In a world of winners there will also be losers. If I win over anything it means someone else must lose. If I lose then someone else won.
What it always comes down to is if others choose us over others or not. If we are chosen to win or not.

If you have reasons as to why someone should live please give them to be cause this trash of a world shouldnt even exist in my point of view.
This is literal hell.
Good things dont last and the bad things that always come right after them are many times worse than the good ones combined.

my sweet kitty, of five years, had to be put down suddenly yesterday for cancer that we had absolutely no idea about.

i fully expected her to come back home that day with a little bandage over her lip and some medicine for it.

i really did have hopes that it was just a granuloma but it turned out to be cancer that had spread throughout her entire left cheek. to get it removed would have meant to remove her entire lower jaw.
i was there for her during her last moments and i can't fucking stop thinking about it. she was so curious and loving even in that doctors office– looking out the window at the cars, rubbing on even the nurse's leg. i was crying the entire time and she was so sweet about it, completely oblivious to the fact that she would not live to see the next day.

i can't get the image out of my head of the pain meds making her vomit and eventually stagger across the floor and fall asleep. i can't stop thinking about the way she wobbled from the meds. she fought against them and wanted more than anything to explore, but the meds did what they had to do. it broke my fucking heart. she seemed pretty damn healthy just the week before, maybe she was skinny but she was still very active and curious, but i knew that letting the tumor grow would mean it would become impossible for her to open her mouth. she would have starved to death. i was presented with exactly three options that day, and each of them were absolutely heart-rending. so i chose the one that hurt her less.

we chose not to receive her ashes and i'm regretting that so, so much right now. i managed to find a little plushie that looks just like her in my attic, that i bought before i got her, and i would fucking kill to be able to get a little vial of her ashes to put inside the plush. i think it's too late to change my mind on that now, and i hate myself for it. i wish i knew what will happen to her precious little delicate body. i hope, whatever they do, they handle her with love and kindness.

this is pretty much the first time i've ever had to grieve for someone close to me and i have absolutely no clue what to do. every fucking thing i see reminds me of her, every place that she used to be brings me to tears. it hurts so much.

i absolutely know that she's not suffering anymore and i'm grateful for that but i can't stop thinking about her, how she loved sleeping in my room and laying outside on the patio and sitting on my lap while i played xbox. i can't stop thinking about how limp her body went once the sedatives kicked in. i can't stop thinking about how her beautiful big blue eyes stayed open even when she finally left. i can't stop thinking about the exact moment that the doctor told me, ""she's gone."" it brings me to fucking tears every time i think about it. i woke up at 6:30 today and couldn't fall back asleep because i couldn't stop thinking about her. i have no fucking clue how i'm going to fall asleep tonight. i don't want to be left alone with my thoughts. i miss her so, so much and i have no clue what to do with myself.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve been fantasizing about how I might die as of recent. I firmly believe I won’t live to reach retirement, as by then I’ll have most likely taken my life, and I take solace in that fact.

When I can’t sleep at night, I like to think about how I may take myself out of this world, whether it be the local bridge, slicing myself, or even calling the cops to shoot me. It strangely makes me happy to think about that, like a finally to a book. Is that wrong of me?

I’ve wanted to ask my therapist, but I’m too afraid of being shipped to an overpriced hospital and sinking my family in debt just to take care of me, especially considering the heavy financial burden I already put on their wallets. However I’ve been becoming more vivid in my fantasies, even imagining a realistic event that could set me off towards that road of self destruction.

SuicideWatch,"Hello everybody!

I think tomorrow (or the day after) will be my last day on this Earth. The choice of the day depends on technicalities, such as eat my favourite meal one last time, spend a last evening with my mom and buy envelopes to wrap up my goodbye letters (yet to write).

I don't care about anything anymore. I just graduated and I don't care AT ALL about what I've studied in the last years. And I have not idea what I could do instead of it... and I don't care about finding a new way of going. 

I feel so so lost and I don't care about anything or anyone. I am in a pitch black abyss, all alone.

Three fucking months of this unbearable pain and I can't take anymore. I don't want to do that job, I don't want to find another job, I don't want to do anything anymore. I want to stop breathing.

And it will eventually happen in 36/60 hours.

When everything started falling down I went to a psycotherapist that told me multiple times that the only thing I can do is go ""through"" the pain to survive, to elaborate it and to being able to move on.

But I can't. I am alone. I have only one friend, but our friendship is so superficial that whenever I try to go under the surface of my fake smiles... it ends there with her changing subject.

I have an ex boyfriend with whom I'm still friend, but he's not really helping. Of course, my dignity doesn't exist anymore and I asked him multiple times to come back with me in a relationship because I need him and he could help me that way. Also we are still fisical attracted to each other and we have a lot of fun playing/watching movies together. But his feelings for me are not the same and I feel so so rejected. In this already fragile state of mind, this rejection burns like fire on my skin.

I feel so empty, alone. I want to disappear. I want to die. 

I don't feel anything anymore... what's the point in this? I can't do anything anymore. I just want to kill myself. And I'm going to.

My psycotherapist consulted herself with a psychiatrist and I'm currently taking AD and benzos, started two weeks ago. I know that AD take a while to work... but I can't anymore.

  
The only person that tries to be by my side in every single moment is my mom. She tries and fights for me, but I am already lost. She wants to find a solution, a way out, but I see everything pitch black and there is nothing anyone can do.

My GP proposed me to recover in the psychiatric wind at the hospital, but she also said that it can hurt me more than help me, since she talked about a lot of sedation and control on my actions. What I think is that they can sedate as much as they want, but if the things in my head don't change there is nothing to do.

I don't want to live like this anymore. I've lost 10 pounds in the last month and I can't/don't want to eat anymore. The only thing I feel is this pain that I have to walk ""through"", but I can't do that.

&amp;#x200B;

So, tomorrow I'll buy the evelopes and write goodbye letters. And then I will be free.",One of my last days on Earth,t3_gsr03j,1

SuicideWatch,"Ive basically been depressed since I was 13, and didn’t get any help with it until I was around 17 and it was almost “too late” 
Along with a string full of other medical issues that contribute negatively to my personal wellbeing. 

That was 10 years ago.
And when I was a kid I thought if I was going to off myself it’d be pretty rad to go out like a rockstar and do it at age 27.

At 22 I decided I didn’t want to do that anymore, and assuming I made it that far, I would get a 27 tattoo to commemorate me not Doing That. and also because its my lucky number and my golden birthday (turned 27 on feb 27)

Well the time is now (johncenamusic dootdoododoo)
But due to the current environment I can’t get my tattoo yet. 
But thats not what I’m trying to get at right now. 

Cause I had to stop working my career of seven years, the day after my birthday and go on medical leave. 
At first it was just debilitating arthritis, but seeing a specialist its more than likely lupus. 
(Still waiting on that blood work lol) 

So I’ve been out of work, and in pain and on meds that make me feel like shit since the end of february. 
And like, my job was incredibly stressful and labor intensive (sterilization technician at a major hospital) and I thought it was going to be one of those things where I would be there until I grew old and retired, no matter how difficult or stressful the demand was. I needed that stability. I needed to make a difference. It was damn near a dream job. 

And now that I’m sick, and I don’t know for how long I’m going to be sick, and the world is sick (literally and figuratively) and everythings gone to hell in a hand basket. Its really unsettling. 
All this happened, this world changing bullshit is happening the year I once told myself I was going to Do It if things didn’t improve...
I’m not saying its karmic justice or anything, but in a sense its kind of ironic bullshit. 

I’m still here, but how I live and how the world is is rapidly changing, and its dangerous and uncertain.
And I want so bad to go back to work and to live my normal life, and I feel so bad about having a stupid fucking immune disorder that makes me unable to work.
I don’t want to have to go to work if I feel like hot wet garbage all the time. I can’t hardly hold a pen or sit down for too long because my hand will cramp and my legs will go numb. My fucking hair is falling out in clumps. Not that I care too much about my hair, its just a physical manifestation of how my illness is affecting me. 

Anyways, what I’m trying to get at is its pretty fucking funny that I stick around only to have my body and the world fall apart. 

And I know I’m not going to Cause My Death, but in a sense its a death of how I used to be.

SuicideWatch,"As I live day by day, life has brought excitement, joy, toughness, hard times and so on. That's what life is tho; we have our good times and bad times as humans. The progression of my life as a young kid started off pretty good. I grew up living that childhood of hanging out with friends outside, playing my video games of course, with my wrestling action figures, and spending time with my family. My father basically raised me most of my life, but that didnt bother me. I loved my father and he showed that he loved me aswell. 

Around the age of 10 I believe, my father got a room mate. My dad enjoyed helping people out, and the person needed help because of hard times so the nice person my father was, let him stay with us. Then things got darker in my life as my dads room mate and his girlfriend were addicted to hard drugs. I still remember everything that happened that morning I woke up. His girlfriend screaming waking my dad, myself and my cousin who spent the night over that day with us. As she is screaming ""call 911"" and as I walk into the bathroom/washroom to figure out what is going on, I see him overdosed on heroin laying in the tub. As I am the one to call 911 at the age of 10 just paranoid and scared of everything going on this moment really set a new destination in life for me. Fast forward a little bit, since this has happened, my father was forced to move out and with no where to go, he went to go live in a motel, which will come up later. 

With me forced to go live with my mom and transfer schools, I didnt really enjoy it too much. As my mom had a gambling problem and didnt really spend too much time with us kids. As all my siblings got older and slowly started moving out, I wanted to make that choice too, even tho I'm only 12, I just didnt want to live there and my mother was already deciding to move out aswell since she didnt need all that room anymore since mostly everyone was moving out. So I made the decision to go live with my father in a motel. 

Summer time before 8th grade starts, I am now living with my father. I wanted to join the foot ball team so it would give me something to do, so just in time before the deadline of join was over, I was able to get on the team. During that time, since I didnt know anyone, making friends was difficult as it required for me to have courage to talk with people. I made a few friends during this time, and honestly I met my best friend during 8th grade which will come in later aswell. So at this part of my life, it's all new to me... living in a motel, with just one bed, a small fridge, a microwave, either eating out all the time or eating small meals was what I had to deal with. It was  all new to me and something i had to get use to, as I made this decision to go live with my dad. 

As 8th grade finishes and I'm super excited for high school, cant wait to finally be that much closer of being done with school. Well, it didnt go the way I wanted it too. I really had a rough start as I was living in a rough situation with home, knowing I had to live in a motel, what my dad has to go through living in this situation aswell not being able to do much more. I really became depressed an extreme amount during highschool. 9th grade I just basically gave up, I failed a lot of classes, i wanted to make money and forget about all of the bad things happening, so I started doing drugs and selling drugs... unfortunately,  someone snitched on my friend and myself, which lead me to court and getting a probation officer and having to do community service for so long.  I had to take some drug addiction classes aswell which was part of a deal with my school in order for them to let me stay in school as they were super close of expelling me. Thankfully I did everything they wanted and I was able to stay.  But one thing that really brought me down, is my father had to have surgery, so at the age of 14, I'm sitting here having to help take care of him and my self, so during a young age I guess you could say, i had to grow up pretty quick. I would make us both food, go places where he needed me to go. Until he healed a little bit, but at the same time, he didnt heal fully. He had to have surgery on neck and just couldn't be completly how he was before so this is when he had to file for disability.  With this, money became way less than what he was making before. But, he still tried his best to get me the things I needed and always tried to have fun. I appreciate it very much of what he did. 

I finish 9th grade, failed a few classes, but I took summer school to make up for most of it. 10th grade is now here. I honestly improved a lot, but at the same time, I didnt really care about anything. Myself, school because I was just so depressed on how my life was going. I manage to pass every class, but still behind the scenes, I'm smoking weed and doing pills to help forget about the bad things going on. Still hanging out with my best friend, as we both sit there depressed talking to just keep our mind positive. Not much really happened in 10th grade that I can remember.  Well, actually there was a big thing that happened during 10th grade. I forgot that this was the year I got my license! I took my driver's ed classes and had my licenses at the age of 16! Which I was super proud of! And also, since I had my license, I went to go get my first job. I worked in a restraunt washing dishes and being a busboy for like 2 weeks and honestly I kinda hated it, so i quit. I was young and just knew that was not what I wanted to be doing. 

11th grade, another wonderful year. I thought to my self, I got to keep trying, and no failing any classes this year. Well, it didnt exactly go that way. But we will get to that in a second. So, as I'm 16 being that depressed teenager, I argue with my father all the time. We argued a lot mostly because I just wanted to have my own bedroom, a kitchen, and just have my own privacy. And living in a motel, just isnt a suitable life for a teenager. He understands, but it's hard for him to get any place to live as what happened from earlier on in life which I mentioned. I'm trying my best in school, but just not 100% as I should be. Being sad all the time minding my own business and thinking about how rough my life is doesnt make it easy to focus on school. I manage to pass almost all my classes... I failed US history which I hated...I went to summer school once again which was more time taken up doing more school work and not enjoying my summer. But it's alright, because I knew I had to do this sacrifice if I wanted to graduate. 

Summer before 12th grade, I had a problem with my spine, Scoliosis,  which is a curve in the spine. With that being said, I had to have surgery which was a big surgery. It took over 8 hours and was on my entire spine. July is when I had the surgery and I will always have that scar on my back and also it hurts like hell! 

12th grade. This is the year! Last year of highschool! I cant mess around, have to focus, get all my work done, pass every class and just live a great life afterwards! So, as this high schooler in 12 grade that is depressed of how I'm living, I wanted to beable to make a change! In order for that to happen, I would need money. So I went looking for a job, got a job at a grocery store.. . Horrible job by the way. Low pay and the work I had to do was insane.. so i worked there from September to the end of December, and also remember I go from having surgery on my spine to working my ass off 2 months later. Pushing carts, bagging food and cleaning for many hours.. larger sacrifice I took fighting through that pain. I turned 18 in November,  and I knew I needed more money, so my self had to get a manufacturing job because I knew they payed pretty good. My dad helped me get a job where he use to work and to be honest, I was making over $18 an hour as a student in highschool. That's honestly pretty good for my age of 18 and still in highschool! 

As I go to highschool, I now started my new job in the beginning of January.  The 7th to be exact of 2018 I believe. I'm going to highschool from like 7:30AM - 2PM.... then after school I basically went straight there to work which started at 2:30PM.. I wanted to make the most money I can so I worked full time.. 8 hours a day and sometimes overtime on the weekends.  I got done at 10:30PM and I did this every single day. I saved up money to help my dad pay for Bill's, and buy food. But I mostly did it so I could make a change for us. I didnt want to see my dad living in a motel or myself. February comes around, and unfortunately my dad had to have another surgery. He had to have surgery on his ankle and foot because when he was younger he broke it as a kid and it had to be looked at again... so while he had that surgery, and in the hospital,  I'm living alone... In the motel, going to school, paying the Bill's, working full time.... as you can see, I didnt get much time to my self and finding time to do my school work was hard, but I did. I tried my hardest to  get all my work done. March comes around, and my dad is in a nursing home until he heals from the surgery, and I manage to find a place to live! From the money I saved up from my job, I got a place. 2 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, it's a beautiful place and it was my first place I got on my own. Bye bye to that motel that I had to live in for almost 5 long horrible years . As I move in and slowly start buying things, and just living, I'm also excited that school is almost over so I can focus on being an adult. My dad finally gets out of the nursing home and I obviously didnt want him going back to that motel, so I let him live with me for a little bit until I help him find a new place. 

End of school is here! I passed every class, managed to get all the credits I needed! I'm graduating! I'm so excited! Also, with the end of school, I'm going to actually have more time to my self. I had to sacrifice 5 long months having almost no time to my self just so I could get to where I was. It was rough for being in highschool, but I'm happy I did. So, living in my own apartment paying my Bill's, I help my dad out, and I arranged for him to go stay with his brother because unfortunately my other uncle passed away and my uncle then had a extra room and I thought it was be nice if my dad would go live their to help out. And it was cheap aswell so my dad can save money. 

Well, I'm living on my own now. Working, coming home doing whatever I want. It is pretty pricey tho... from what I'm making and having to pay for electric, rent and water and internet and so on... It did get a little pricey but it was fine. I enjoyed how I was living. I payed every bill on time! Had amazing credit for a 18 year old. Then 19 comes around and well, I wanted to get a new vehicle. So I contacted my bank and since I had amazing credit, they gave me a $15,000 loan for a awesome reliable vehicle. It's the year 2019 and I bought a 2016 car. I was happy! Bought my own car. Before I was just borrowing my dad's vehicle to get to work. I forgot to mention that. But now this was got from me. Paying my monthly bill, insurance and keeping it well taken care of. 

Now, things are starting to get a little more expensive, as I have more Bill's, credit card, internet, gas, food, rent, utilities, phone bill, I start to realize I need to look for something cheaper.. lucky for me, my other uncle, not the one my dad is living with, but my other one had an extra room because his room mate just moved out... so he offered me to stay with him which would save me so much money! Which I took his offer. I'm living with my uncle now, and it's a whole new chapter in my life now. 

I decided I wanted to try something different. I get a new job as a construction worker. Iron worker to be exact. We built buildings with metal and stuff like that. Heights and everything. It was something new, I didnt mind it at all. Still paying all my bills, living a good life and then things start to get bad. 

I was then in a car accident. The accident was not my fault, but the other person didnt have insurance, so I got screwed over... my insurance company finished paying off my car, but I then got left with no car. This was a major disappointment as the car accident caused pain to my back more and since my back already hurt the way it was from the surgery long ago, it didnt help make it better. Added more pain. Now I have pain, no car and no way to get to work, since for my job I had to travel a lot throughout the state. So, I'm forced to quit my job. No job, pain in my back, and no car. Well, i try my best to budget my money which I did have, which was rough. I couldn't buy much, i couldn't even go anywhere basically since i have no car. My money is running low as i continue to pay my Bill's, feed my self and pay for what I need. 

I need a job, so I look for something close by, I get one. But it's not what I expected, I had to package stuff for 12 hours straight with two 15 minute breaks... its was rough, and then one day my back just gave out from working too hard. I couldn't manage doing the job, I was let go because I couldn't do it anymore. I went home crying in pain and just trying to find ways to come up with paying my Bill's, I got my paychecks from that place so it helped me pay for 2 more months... but then those 2 months went by... only way to come up with money was selling my computer. This was the hardest thing I had to do.. it was my favorite thing to do, as I enjoyed playing games, watching movies, youtube and doing everything on it. I sold it just to pay my bills... now all I have left to do is sit on my phone and sit In the dark crying of how shitty my life is. 

And on top of that, now we have this Corona virus, well, I get that 1200 dollar stimulus check which helped me out a lot! I bought a bike to get around more places and payed Bill's once again.... now I have about $350 left. Enough to pay rent for one more month. I'm sitting here going on bike rides to keep me occupied, but I cant do anything else since I have no money to do anything. There is days I dont eat because I cant afford to. But it's fine. I applied for food stamps, so I actually have like $140 a month for food. Which helps. I dont eat much so half the time I dont even use it all, but it helps in my situation. I hate that i have to get food stamps because i dont want to live off of the state, but I know I need to take care of my self and eating is a major priority.  I was always a person that never asked for help. I would rather starve a few days until I got payed before asking for money or food. 

As I sit here an pay my last little bit of money on rent... I am sitting here looking every day for a job.. within this month I have applied for atleast 15 different jobs and even called them up... but no one seems to be hiring and since I dont have a car, I only can look for jobs close by. I hate that I am limited to where I can go. I hate not having a vehicle. I miss having a job. I miss being able to have fun and leave whenever I want to just drive around! Its May of 2020... I have about $4 in my bank account just wanting to give up. 

I have a suicide letter wrote, a video for my father that has helped me the most, sleeping medication and a bunch of pills sitting In front of me just waiting until I get the courage to do it! I cant do this anymore. I cant live knowing I cant AFFORD to live. The fact that I have literally 3 days to either get a job or get my rent, i feel like it's impossible. I wish my life would have gone different and I wish I would have never had that damn car accident! I would still be working, having a vehicle, paying my Bill's, saving money living a great life. But one thing, screws everything up. Sad how my life just went from happy to dead Inside from one tragedy.  

I'm sorry, this isnt everything that has been going on, but I tried to summarize it the best I can and I wanted to just share my story. I've neve told anyone about my story and if I decide to get that courage to end it all and stop this suffering, I might aswell share it somewhere. I'm not the greatest writer as I just threw this together randomly. Not really the best structuring , but I just typed whatever came to mind. 

I appreciate you reading if you did read it all. I know it's long and boring, but this is my life. This is my struggle and the only way to stop it and feel better is if I felt nothing at all. My life is too hard to fix. I'm broken. I cry every night, just wishing it would get better. Praying for a call back from a job, but no calls. Praying for a miracle to happen. It's been too long living like this an i just dont know if I can do it anymore. My rent is due by June 1st, but hey, my 25,000 life insurance will beable to cover the funeral and also pay the rent I owe. And then the rest can go to my father and hope he enjoys it as i love him very much and could never repay him for everything he has done for me. Thank you dad. 

Thank you everyone for reading. Sorry if there is any grammar mistakes, but this is my story. I'm 20 years old, my name is Nathan, and it was a pleasure sharing this with you all. My time is coming to a end soon tho, I hope you all have an amazing life tho. Have a beautiful day!",I've let everyone down including myself.,t3_gsrpjv,1

SuicideWatch,"I’m scared of how many times I thought about suicide yesterday. 
Can I give you some background to my current situation (since March 15)? I have been working full time while also taking care of my toddler. He is almost 17 months old. 
It’s an impossible task to work full time and try to take care of my LO. if you have no concept of this, set a timer for 20 mins to go off for the next 13 hours. But the timer also needs to go off at 5, 7, and 10 min intervals because the wrong video is on, the food is now cold, I want this thing I can’t have, I want your undivided attention, teething, time for a nap, etc etc. 
I worked for 5 weeks, started having debilitating panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. (I have anxiety and depression but it has been in check outside of this pandemic). 
I took 3 weeks off of work. Panic attacks stopped almost immediately, suicidal thoughts gone. I felt like a great mom and wife while I was off. It was magical in comparison. 

I started back at work 2 weeks ago and I’m already back to panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. The workload is INSANE. Even in office this workload would be nuts, but obviously more manageable. I work with clients on the issues they have with a web application we offer. The work sits in my head like a building timer and then the sensory overload of my teething toddler screaming just makes me snap into a panic attack. He’s cutting his 5th tooth since 03/15. 
The daycare (through my work) has given us no indication of a re-open date. Then someone delivered via the grapevine that the daycare may not be reopening at ALL as our company was recently acquired by a new larger company, new company “doesn’t want to take on the cost of the daycare”. 


I really scared myself yesterday. It’s never felt so real.. 
There I was, hiding in my shower, crying, googling the Suicide prevention hotline. 
I wouldn’t call it because, well, fear and shame. Would cops show up until someone came to get my son and they cart me off to my local mental health facility? Would I always be labeled with this tag of someone who can’t be trusted to take care of their own child? My kid can’t even sleep at night without me how am I supposed to just abandon him?

Should I have called that line? What do I do? I can’t keep on at this rate, I am genuinely scared of what could come from this. 

I could quit my job, theoretically... isn’t that a horrible idea considering I should be thankful I have a job with so many millions of Americans out of work? 
I can ask for more time off, I know I NEED to do this, but there is some stupid nagging voice in my head that is afraid to. I need to just tell my boss that I’m back here...

SuicideWatch,"Everytime I read a post about someone wanting to kill themselves ,there's always someone talking about ""what about the people who love and care for you?"", and honestly, it makes me feel awful because I have no one. 

This is not because I'm sick and can't recognize the people around me that actually care about me. I legitimately have no one.

This makes me want to disappear even more. How come I have no one? What kind of human being has no one?  Supposedly every person has at least one person to care about them.

When I was growing up I thought to myself that it was ok, I could manage being alone and that it wasn't as bad as it seems, but honestly, as I grew older I noticed that life is unbearable when you're alone.

Sometimes I really wish I at least believed in god, because maybe I could find some comfort in faith.
For what I've seen, people that believe in god have hope that things will get better, that everything happens for a reason and that every human being exists for a reason.

What bothers me the most is that I don't even have the right to choose what to do with my own existence. People should be able to decide and die with dignity, like in euthanasia.

She is currently in the psych ward and says she’s mad she didn’t take more pills and end it.

The suicide note she left us says she’s been hurting for over 10 years and cannot take the pain and misery of life and wants to at peace in death.

We, my family, know she struggles with anxiety and depression and have tried to support her in every way and find her help.

I’m lost as to what to do. I want her to find relief from her pain, but in life. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? I do not know what to do anymore..

I love my sister and I don’t want to lose her",My sisters second attempt,t3_gsncx9,1
SuicideWatch,"Ok now I’m really struggling. With all the riots going on I’m nearly done with humanity. I’ve been looking through twitter to see so many people say all cops no matter what are evil and I’m trying to stay convinced that it’s not all of them because I’m trying to see the good in at least some people but I’m starting to give up. I think I’m even starting to hate cops too. Regardless of whatever ya’lls opinions are, I’ve almost lost all of my humanity. I only have a few ounces of it left. I need help before I can’t even break free and possibly cause awful things. I just need the right person to talk to. I can’t talk to a hotline because they might send people over and I don’t need that. I just need to vent.",Giving up on humanity?,t3_gsugf4,1
SuicideWatch,"I’ve made a crap ton of mistakes in my life, I lied a LOT. Most of those just to make people feel bad for me or whatever. I guess I just wanted the comfort then, someone to agree with me. I have a mother which I hate maybe more than myself, a family that doesn’t care, a horrid attitude, one disgusting face (luckily it’s clean, but still overall ugly) and I’m dumb. I wanna kill myself, but like many others, I’m scared of it. I also just wanna take the piss outta my mom who is completely fine with me dying (perhaps because I make her feel too incompetent, not my fault you’re a bad parent and worse at the internet). And to top it all off, I’ve made the maybe horrible decision to cut off all my irl friends. I don’t think I’ll be able to make any online ones either cause not only do I value keeping my info safe a LOT, i’m also bad at making friends (surprise surprise, the suicidal good for nothing can’t make friends). So I’m just stuck in a pit of suffering. You don’t really need to comment, I just feel a bit happier knowing someone knows about how crappy everything in my life is (myself included). But on a lighter note I do have a fairly good way of life. I will admit by some miracle my grades are good, however in the real world I’d be utterly useless. I have a decent housing situation. I live in one of those fancy villages with gates everywhere and all those big homes and mansions, in general I would say we are quite lucky to be in the upper middle class where I live. So I also feel it would kind of be a waste to commit suicide. Like when you have all this great loot on your save in a game and all these buffs.

SuicideWatch,"my boyfriend went behind my back to talk to girls on onlyfans and cam sites after I told him when we started dating that I considered it cheating. as far as I know he has been doing it since we started dating.

he promised he'd never do it again, and I believe that he believes that, but I'm scared that in the future he'll fall back into those habits. I can't trust him anymore. every time he's gone at work I can't stop thinking about him getting off to those girls and thinking of being with them instead of me.

I'm too scared to go back to inpatient because I feel like he's just going to do it all again because I won't be able to have sex with him or keep an eye on him while I'm gone.

I can't do it anymore, but I also can't live without him in my life, so I plan to take my life before the end of the year.

SuicideWatch,"Long story short I was laid off. I'm interviewing for a new job but I am having a really tough time believing I will get it. I don't really see any hope for myself finding any kind of inner peace or having a future worth living, either in my personal life or career.

My wife, my therapist, friends, anyone I seem to talk t about wanting to kill myself immediately jumps to my guns. I have several guns, they are my only real hobby and sometimes they make me feel happy. Yes, it is possible I would kill myself with them, but they are the only material possessions that really matter to me.

Their first instinct is asking me about the guns, demanding I get rid of them or send them somewhere else. I'm terrified someone is going to call the police and have them intervene, at which point I'll lose my gun rights and that would really send me over the edge. It's also one of the only things keeping me from making an attempt- I know if I botched it I would lose my guns for good.

Is there any resource, any phone line in the US where I can talk to somebody who absolutely will not try to call the police or lecture me about my hobbies? I am feeling really strong urges to kill myself and it is NOT ABOUT MY GUNS.

SuicideWatch,"It seems the typical situation for people wanting to kill themselves is that they're sad and their life is a struggle and they want the pain to end. But why does it feel like sometimes my thoughts on wanting to kill myself are more on impulse. Like the intrusive thoughts that tell you to touch the hot stove or drop your phone down the center of a staircase. You don't want to be injured, just your brain is bored or something and touching the thing that will injure you seems fun I guess? Or not fun, but at least end the boredom or something? But like I was out on a walk today and I was walking across a bridge and there was a sign that said no diving off the bridge because it was dangerous. And then it's like, great, now I have to fight against my brain not to climb over the railing and jump into the river below and most likely injure myself and possibly drown, just because the idea was put in my head. Did I want to die in that moment? Not particularly. It just seemed like fun I guess? The thought was even accompanied by a sense of excitement? Part of me feels like there's something really wrong with me but another feels like I'm perfectly fine. And I feel like I should mention this to a doctor or something but I'm also convinced they won't take me seriously? And like I don't take myself seriously? I mean, I've dealt with this for so long clearly I must not be at any actual risk or I would have died long ago? I can't even figure out how to tell my doctors that I don't think i actually have depression and that it feels like something else, how am I supposed to describe feeling this messed up in the head. I'm just worried that anytime I try to bring up a mental health concern it will just get brushed aside. Am I crazy? Do I need help? I'm mostly just distressed that part of my brain wants me to randomly do dangerous stuff like this, and also that I can't even do depression and suicidal ideation correctly because I'm too happy for them.

SuicideWatch,"For the past 5 years I've been extremely alone and isolated.  My life totally fell apart and within the last 3 years I've contemplated suicide a lot.  Thing is, I'm 17 and want to live a full happy life but I'm so pinned and trapped that its seeming like suicide is my only option.  The past 3 weeks have been crazy difficult.

SuicideWatch,"I never thought I would be posting here. 

I have suffered and struggled with depression and anxiety for years over several periods in response to various issues and events. I came very close to taking my own life a few years ago but something turned me around, and I was able to see that my situation and the associated feelings may pass. And they did. I have even been able to talk openly with my family about my feelings relating to suicide, and I was able to tell them that in the event of any future episodes of loss of hope, I might just be able to stay positive, and only a major physical ailment would cause me to consider ending my life.

And sadly, thats where I am now. For reasons which cannot be ascertained, my face is becoming deformed. I suffered a minor disorder in my teens which left me with a mild asymmetry. It was able to be partially resolved with a couple of surgeries, and my life went pretty well. Not perfect by any means, but I was happy to be alive, and I know that made me lucky. My asymmetry didn't hold me back and I think that as I grew into my face it was barely noticeable. A couple of people had mentioned it over the years in an attempt to hurt me, but the fact that they would use something like that against me meant that they weren't the kind of people who held opinions that I valued. It seemed like a weak, cheap insult and made me feel more sorry for them than for me. 

Since last year something started happening to my face. First the changes were small. I could only feel them while washing my face in the shower. Nothing was visible. But following an incredible burst of growth and change in the last three or four months I am left with a huge asymmetry affecting the upper part of my face and my skull in general - in particular one of my eyes and the surrounding area. I don’t want to give details, but one side of my face and head is ballooning out in all directions. Everything is becoming crooked and twisted and as much as I wish this was in my imagination, it isn't. My concerns have been validated by medics and close family.

A scan has shown no reason for it. The symptoms and progression don’t match any of the obvious conditions which could lead to this. In fact, due to the fact that this could be seen as a reoccurrence of an earlier, long dormant issue, there is speculation that ""this could just be the way you are"". Covid means that because this isn't a malignant issue such as cancer, there's no other diagnostic route to take at the moment. But I have already run out of time. This needed to be stopped three months ago. 

The speed of progression from what I considered to be normal to where I am now has been horrific. Just a few months ago my face was mine, and it wasn't perfect but I loved it. Since then each day has brought incredible physical and emotional pain, and alongside that pain has come growth which has elongated the bones and pushed my face into a place that it shouldn't be. It has also affected my jaw severely and the function is becoming increasingly compromised. 

I have lost count of the number of photos and videos which I took to mark the progression. But I can scan through them randomly and pick out exactly when they were taken just by the shape of my face, and the extent of the disfigurement. 

My feelings started with ""maybe I am imagining this"", moved to ""well, this is happening but maybe it will stop or a cause will be found"", and I am currently at “this is inconceivable. Nobody can help me, and at this rate within two months I will be blind and unable to leave the house"". 

I am already at a point where I consider the level of disfigurement to be beyond what I can cope with. It has reached the stage where people will notice even if they aren't directly interacting with me. I am in a state of complete despair. Where I was able to see hope in the past, I see only the potential for more upset, more pain, and further loss of function. The magnitude and location of the issue means that it cannot be corrected. So each night I go to sleep knowing that today was the best I will ever look, and tomorrow will be a little worse.

The pain is almost constant. Pain itself can be alleviated a little by medication. But I know that the pain over the last few months has signified new growth, so it is reasonable to assume that continued pain means that its still happening. The fear that this brings me is indescribable. 

The time for looking at carefully angled photos and videos ended a week ago and my mind is beginning to adapt in a rather matter-of-fact way to the reality that I will spend the rest of my life in torment and pain, and the only thing which I have control over is what ""the rest of my life"" really means.

I have had tearful conversations with my mother and my sister to explain to them that I will be ending my life, and that the time will be soon. They are of course devastated. I had agreed with my mother that any final plans would be deferred until after the results of the scan, and she was right to force me to do so. I guess there was a chance that a cause may have been found for my condition. Even if the cause had itself been horrific, at least I could have blamed something for my condition. As it stands I have no idea whats happening to me. I think my mother and sister shared my hope that a cause and maybe a solution would be found. My mother says she understands my wish to end my life. We will see whether that is really the case. My sister does not. And I respect her for that. 

The absence of a root cause is bewildering, and the speed at which the changes are occurring is like nothing else I can find described anywhere online. The fact that this is happening during the isolation imposed by the Covid situation, at a time in my life where a lot of positive career and personal changes were just around the corner, and that this involves what has always been my greatest fear - facial disfigurement - makes me feel like I am in a nightmare designed especially for me.

I have told a few friends and colleagues that I have some issues with my jaw and some associated problems with my face. But thats all. I haven’t seen them due to the Covid lockdown, and working from home means I have been relatively isolated from everyone that knows me. If this affected any other part of me then I would tell them everything. And I know that if this was anywhere else on my body then I would be able to deal with it. But because it affects my face I feel a great deal of shame and embarrassment. 

My emotions about death are so confusing to me, but I can just about rationalise them. I feel justified that I will end my life, but at the same time I’m so sad that this is how things will end for me. Of all of the ways that my story could have gone this was one of the most unlikely and upsetting outcomes that I could have imagined. I have loved my life, and I wish that it could go on for a bit longer. I didn't know that I was going to have so little time. Even just another few months without this burden would bring me so much joy. 

I know that other people go through and live through so much worse. But I have reached the hard limit that I defined so clearly in my head a long time ago, and I just don't have the strength to get through this. What was a hypothetical worst case scenario has become real, and that reality is much worse than I could have imagined. 

I can’t even watch TV without feeling hurt. Everyone that I see on screen feels me with jealousy and sadness, because they are “normal”. They probably take it for granted, and that’s understandable. My previous experiences with being facially different meant that I never took it for granted. I always felt lucky for what I had. I wasn’t good looking, but I was really close to normal after my surgeries, and that counted for so much considering how I felt when I went through my earlier issues. If I watch a show or a movie that I have seen before, I remember that I was normal the last time I saw it. If I even reminisce about a happier time of my life it always ends up with me thinking about how normal i was back then. My situation is inescapable and thoughts of it consume every waking moment of my existence. 

So now I am faced with the harsh realities of finalising my last weeks or months. Closing down my affairs and finances, and performing the real life equivalent of deleting my internet history. 

At this exact moment I am a coward, and the prospect of actually killing myself fills me with fear. I live in a nation where firearms are rare, assisted suicide is illegal, and the availability of drugs which are useful in suicide is strictly controlled. Any overdose attempt now would be speculative and far from guaranteed. But I feel that the coming weeks will resolve these issues. Each day I feel a greater need to die, and as my pain and discomfort increases then so will the strength of my medications. Once I get hold of the powerful stuff then that will be my prompt to act. This will be much later than I would have hoped, as the desired time has already passed. But other methods of ending my life would be much more unpleasant, and my key concern is that I cause the minimum of distress to others. I know that the act itself will cause pain to so many people, but I hope that in time they will understand why I chose to die. 

I’m sorry for such a long post. Writing it has brought me immeasurable sadness, but at the same time it has aligned a lot of my thoughts. These aren’t feelings which I can share with anyone close to me, but I just wanted someone to know how I am feeling, even if I’m just an anonymous throwaway account on Reddit.

All of us have an infinite capacity for the most perverse forms of evil and little to no capacity for doing anything objectively good, and even when we do good things it’s just to give ourselves a pat on the back. No one chooses to do good for its own sake. People do care, but it’s a mute point since it’s virtually always for the wrong reasons. You think I’m wrong? Go ahead and give me your best shot.

SuicideWatch,"TL;DR Below! 

Just as the title says, I'm finally cleaning my room. It's been years since I last cleaned my room, and the amount of junk in my room made it so I couldn't even see the floor. I just got so depressed I couldn't even get up to go throw all my shit away.

Underneath my bed is the worst, and the part I'm tackling currently. Glass bottles, plates, cups, packets of things etc. I always felt like I was being lazy, and beat myself up for it, but it was just depression. Just pure sadness and discomfort.

I've stored all my important things on my shelves, and taken out all the boxes I've been hoarding. I'm happy. For once.

Honestly, if you guys are dealing with depression to the point where you're living in mess, please, if anything, perhaps you could clean your bed? I know having a fresh bed free of packets and old boxes really elevated my mood and helped me sleep at night. 

I know this may not be much to some people, but I was just in awe of how happy I've been lately just because I've finally reclaimed my room as my own. I'm still struggling every day with my body image and my own mental health issues, but this is a step! I always encourage steps in the right direction. 

TL;DR I cleaned my room from old plates, bottles, cups, and packets. I'm finally free, and I'm feeling so much happier knowing I have a safe place in my house to go to when I need to escape, rather than seeing my room as a jail.",I'm finally cleaning my room after years.

SuicideWatch,"I just want the noise in my head to stop. It's a constant cycle between being overstimulated and dissociating. I'm 30yrs old and so exhausted from waking up stuck inside of this head. I'm ready to complete what I've been thinking about for years. I have the belt and the state park is open again. I've attempted many times but I know, for certain reasons, that this time won't be difficult.

A few weeks ago someone that I used to call my best friend for 14 years died when he crashed his car into a ditch while driving drunk(it was single vehicle accident). He was intelligent, talented and had the biggest heart. I couldn't stop thinking about how he was alone when this happened. I can't stop thinking about his smile and the way he laughed.

And then yesterday, I find out that someone else I've known for about 10yrs died. He died by suicide. This has hit me a like a ton of bricks. Every time that I hear of someone dying by suicide, it feels like someone punched me in the face....  This friend has a young daughter and so many people that cared about him. I know how painful it is to feel so isolated with thoughts of wanting to die. He shouldn't have been alone.

I cut my arm up pretty bad yesterday. For the past 8 months I've been cutting every week as opposed to every month or so like I had been doing for years. I don't know how else to calm myself down. I use other coping skills but self-harm seems to be the most effective and quick release of all the anxiety and deep sadness.

I hate making this about me but my first thoughts when I heard about these friend's deaths were: It should've been me. I'm the one who should be gone.

I'll be going to the woods in a couple days or so to drown out the noise.... I hope. Sometimes what stops me is the adrenaline rush that I get when I start wheezing and I feel pinpricks in my hands. I get images of what my decaying body will look like when someone finds me. I think about the insects and animals feeding on my corpse. I think about my sister and how far she's come after struggling with alcoholism and depression for so long. I think about my roommates and my other close friend that lives states away from me now. I think about much this will destroy them and just hope to ""god"" that they will grieve and move on as quickly as possible.

Seriously, if you don’t know what it is, it’s a new visual from season 4 of Attack On Titan, a Japanese anime. While that might sound ridiculous to you that some Japanese cartoon is the reason I’m not ending it yet, let me explain.

I discovered this show as my 15 year old brain was at the main stage of development. The themes in this show influenced me so much that I still carry them to this day, which is probably why I haven’t ended my life yet.

It deals with themes of living in a cruel, merciless world where everything and everyone hates you and wants you dead, but pushing forward and fighting anyways to achieve the freedom that has been rightfully yours since the day you were born, no matter how many times the world may try to take that from you.

It’s not some sugar coated “Just enjoy the small things in life uwu” or “If you just eat healthy, exercise and work hard, you’ll be 100% better by the end of it!” This anime doesn’t baby you. It’s upfront and real about how there’s a chance that your worst fears may come true, and that everything you’ve worked towards up to this point is utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Yet, you can choose to demonstrate your inner strength by choosing to move forward anyway. No matter how many dreams of yours are crushed.

SSRIs only made extremely apathetic and emotionally blunted but at the same time didn't help my anxiety at all - not even 1%. Vortioxetine was the same plus it gave me horrible stomach pain. Mirtazapine was the same, but also made me extremely lethargic. Wellbutrin at least helps a little with the amotivation and apathy, but it makes the anxiety a little worse as well.

I’m super fucking upset and want to just die. It doesn’t help I have borderline personality disorder and it doesn’t help that I live where I do. I’m always going to be criticized for it. I’m always going to be judged for it. My fucking opinion doesn’t matter. My voice doesn’t matter. No matter what I say and do or DONT say and do, I’m the fucking bad guy. I used to keep my opinions completely to myself. I used to just not say anything or take part. The only living breathing being that used to know my opinions was my dog, because I cannot fucking trust people. I wouldn’t even vote, for fear of judgement. That’s what 13 years of dictatorial and evil bitch parent does to a person.

My opinion doesn’t matter. I don’t matter. My actions don’t even matter. I’m the kid of a cop and I’m pretty sure there’s people out there who are hating on me wishing I was dead.

I’m not a fucking racist or any of those other things but apparently I am by implication and association. My dad isn’t any of those things either. I tried to stand up for the fact that my dad doesn’t fucking suck. And I got hate.


And I bet people would laugh and sing and dance if “the racist cops kid” killed himself. People would be actually happy that “one less racist” existed.

I’m living at home with my family now with a toxic relationship with my mom. I feel horrible and disgustingly privileged to be even thinking about suicide. I haven’t seen sunlight in 2 months because of trying to keep my mom’s anxiety about COVID at bay. I wanted 2020 to be the year I finally curb my depression, to start out the new decade strong. I’ve always had “high-functioning” depression. No one can ever tell except for how much I cry on a regular basis. I told my parents I need to get on antidepressants because I’m scared of my thoughts. I don’t want to worry my boyfriend or any of my friends, so here I am on reddit. Growing up, I was always too scared to do lasting damage so I would just punch my legs or scratch myself with led pencils.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve been dreaming, imagining how i’m going to kill myself. Whenever i think about this, i feel a sense of calm, finally a place i can rest and all my problems will be gone. Imagine it like you’re driving a car, and the car keep getting faster and faster and you want it to slow down but you don’t know how. You only know that suicide is the break, a pedal that u can press but you car will stop forever. 

I think about what happens after i die, my body, atoms, will return back to nature. The universe will continue normally just like before i was born. I know it’s wrong but in a way i look at suicide as a beautiful thing. Someone, who has been suffering, freed from their pain, resting in peace. 

It feels calm as i stand at the roof. But at the same time i’m too scared to go nearer to the edge. I’m afraid i might actually do it and jump. It tells me that deep down, i know i want to live. As i have these thoughts, i can’t help but feel selfish. I ask myself, “well if you’re so suicidal why don’t you commit suicide now? Don’t undermine the people who actually committed suicide, you didn’t suffer as much as them. You would be so selfish if you committed suicide. You will burden your family and friends with the pain”

Life is beautiful. It’s not just about constantly being happy. The pain, the hardships and not knowing everything is what makes life special. The mystery is beautiful. We fail and we fail but we have hope, goals that we want to achieve and we continue to try no matter how hard it gets. We have faith.

But as I constantly try to move on with life, the more i realise, there is no place for me here. It seems like i simply am not capable of finding anything here. It seems dark, and whenever i run from it and see some light, the huge darkness will always catch up.","I don’t want help to make my life better, i want it to end",t3_gsf6ev,1

My OCD, although it never gave me problems before, has started providing intrusive thoughts that make me want to rip out my own brain. They make me want to vomit. They make me physically recoil. And they come out of nowhere. It spirals me into a pit of despair I don’t know how to climb out of and I don’t know how to escape them or prevent them. 

Everything is so, so pointless. It all means nothing. What’s the point? There isn’t one. I found myself in the bathroom getting ready for bed and my brain starting wondering about ways I could actually just end it. Just make it stop. I probably never could, I have people I love with my whole heart who I could never do that too. But it was in my head. How I could just end it. How it would probably hurt but at least I’d be feeling something again until I finally, genuinely felt nothing ever again.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve always thought about if I wasn’t here anymore but I’ve always convinced myself it would be better if I just kept going. However until recently I found myself with different answer. Why shouldn’t I do it? Some background: I’m 18 years old dropped out of high school. I’ve had many friends in my life but never for very long. At least not to the point I would consider them people I truly trust. The only friend I’ve ever had that I hold dear was actually someone I’ve never met. I’ve always been there for him but I recently ended it because he was never there for me when I needed him and honestly he’s made me wish he was dead. But that’s not the point. 

I’ve never been able to keep a real life relationship that wasn’t my parents. People say they like me and enjoy my company and I don’t doubt that, but only they like me because I put on a mask about my interests and emotions, so it’s never really me. When I do show my feeling and interests I become an invisible blob that people would rather ignore. 

I’ve tried to get help from talking about people but I can’t even get proper face to face therapy because of my location. The only time I actually got real help was for a very short period of time when a psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar, Depression, and Generalized anxiety disorder while feeding me pills that made me fat and tired but I still felt exactly the same. I eventually stopped seeing her because I felt like she didn’t really care about what I was telling her. Actually a big factor to why I never finished school is because they kept telling me my problems were not a big deal and they really didn’t care about what I had to say. Maybe my problems are not a big deal? I didn’t care and I could barely get through the day without destroying my mental health in the process so I decided that I would quit. But even then the relief was temporary. After I quit school I set out a plan with goals for getting a job, exercising, meet new people, maybe finally get a girlfriend. I was truly happy and relieved and all of the sudden I was back to square one with a global pandemic basically shutting down the whole fucking planet. The worst part is I started having kidney/bladder issues that I don’t understand. 

I’ve been so angry and just yesterday I though to myself “if I was to kill myself I wouldn’t have to deal with any of that anymore” I know my problems are laughable at worst but I can’t but feel like my life will never have any kind of normalcy. 

The only people that would probably even know I died would be parents since I have literally no more friends in real life or on the internet. 


There goes it. If kill myself at least I posted this beforehand. I’m still going to think about it but I think my mind is made up. I’ve got no achievements and if I did it wouldn’t matter because I have nobody to share them with.

I had originally planned to reapply to uni since I dropped out but now the deadline is in just over a month and I've not even started my application, and don't think I will, because I don't see the point or can envision a future where it happens and I just don't know how to even start again. I've also just stopped enjoying and doing so many things, I used to have multiple hobbies and things that made me happy, and now nothing makes me happy anymore, infact nothing makes me feel anything in the slightest bit of REAL positive emotion anymore, I only ever experience a flatline of nothing, or negative emotions, and all I do all day is either sleep, play games, or literally do nothing because I haven't got the energy or desire to do more. I've also just stopped speaking to so many people, part of me believes it's because our friendships were meaningless and toxic which is for the greater good but the other part of me just believes it's because I don't have what it takes to engage in friendships anymore as it's exhausting, I literally talk to about 3 people regularly... Which leads to my next point, I only talk to people I know online. The thought of actually meeting my friends makes me feel so uncomfortable and I have ZERO desire and will to be able to do so. I don't know why, I really don't, I think it's just because socialising makes me dissociate and anxious and hyper-aware and exhausted.

SuicideWatch,"Hi 

Just wrote out a massive post that took about and hour to write and ended up accidentally refreshing rather than posting and I cba writing my story again so here's the tldr version.

Took an overdose alongside 1litre of whiskey, ended up drunkenly leaving flat and someone called ambulance so was saved there. 

Took another overdose 60 X 500mg paracetamol, had nausea for first few hours then pain for next few days then nothing I just went back to normal.

I know that paracetamol is a horrible way to go but at the time I had not done any research and had no access to any other method.

My research now shows that 12 g can be fatal yet when I took 30g I just went back to normal after a few days. I wouldn't say I'm young (around 30) and I wouldn't say I'm healthy either. 

While I'm not planning to use this method again I am still curious as to why it wasn't fatal the second time when I wasnt treated for it.

Anyone have any ideas?

This is the first time I’ve ever opened up fully to anyone but I can’t take it anymore and I’m a little drunk so that helps. I’m a 21 year old male I’ve been fucked over by people my whole life. I used to be pretty fat in middle and high school but recently lost a lot of weight I’ve never had a real relationship or in that fact real sex. The past few years have been shit. Freshman year of college I got in my first “relationship” and was cheated on and lied to before the relationship was a week old so it ended after like 6 days. Sophomore year I was raped by a girl. Junior year I fell in love and was ghosted after three months. The only time I’ve had sex was when I was raped. Trust me I’ve tried to have sex but I was either to fat in the past or most recently with the girl that ghosted me, I made a move while we were making out and she said no so I stopped. I don’t know what to do. I feel like most of my problems stem from girls and my confidence. I feel like I deserve better than a girl that just smokes weed all day and is kinda rude and gross (no offense). I feel like those are the main girls that talk to me on dating apps and nowadays that’s the only way I can meet people because of the quarantine. The girls I’ve been in “relationships” in the past have been really pretty but I’m so scared that I won’t meet someone like that who would last. What is wrong with me? I’m super nice but not the weird asshole kind of nice guy (fuck those guys). I’m pretty funny, at least funnier than my friends that hang out with girls all the time. I don’t know what to do I’m so lost. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I’m jealous of my friends (former popular kids in high school) they meet girls so easy because of their confidence and looks but they are such assholes. I just want to die, when the girl I was last talking to ghosted me I started cutting, I’ve never done that before but it really helped me find physical pain to match my emotional pain. I’ve held a knife up to my throat so many times before but I can never go through with it. I pray to god constantly throughout the day to give me the courage to kill myself but my prayers are never answered, just like the prayers for god to help me out in life.

SuicideWatch,"Hi there, whoever there might be reading this.

Below are my first and last post on Reddit, and last words towards this world which I lost all meaning to.

It’ll sound like some sort of “ stream of consciousness ”, and it’s really long, so I hope you all won’t mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 15, honestly 16 by the end of this year, so no biggie.

I’m sorry I’m making my age sound like my own identification; although, as if I have any right to an identification at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just here to tell my story, I’m not sure why, but maybe I just wanted some sort of forgiveness to my death; some sort of justification which I’ve been waiting for my entire life, yet never was approved neither given to this very day of my leaving this world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I might sound ironic because I am such a “ people’s person” in everyone’s eyes, or maybe just pure ridiculous. But really, after all this time from when I once had faith to this point which I’ve lost all and drifted off to this path of pure torture, I’ve again successfuly acheived what I had predicted from the start. I’ve managed to slowly make everyone disgusted of me, and I’ve managed to make all of them hate me and/or dislike me and resent me.

I have long thought I’d be lonely in the end, because I know very well that one day, all of this rotten pain and agony will leak out and scare all of those near me away.

But, well, it’s not like I need them anyway. They’ve proven their worthlessness the second they chose to be disgusted. And the second they became worthless: they became dead inside of me.

Dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I lost them one by one; I became more and more filled with self-denial, pain, unrecognizable sadness, and a new sort of sickness. 

( Yes, self-denial from the start of my life. I was really always trying to please people. But sadly, I’ve never been able to hate them at all, except my parents. Why? I’ve never been hurt by any other people in the wrong sorts of ways. )

And as this disease grew, in my state of hell, I began to see things clearer. I began to see how much I hate the two which I’ve placed so much faith upon. My mind became fallen apart by days in a more and more joyfully masked stupid grin, and nights in restless sleep continuously disturbed by short panic attacks whenever I close my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

There were images of odd things whenever I tried to rest. It’s kind of hilarious: chair legs with ends in thin and translucent spider-legs; spinning sea shells that become an never ending spiral stair-way the closer you look; people, children, widening their mouths as they cried in a twisted moan.

I suppose I watch too many horror movies, haha.

And then I’d wake up, unable to move or open my eyelids for a short half minute, only but my legs twitching uncontrollably as if I was trying to run.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my oh-so-friendly smiles? I was surprised myself. I never knew I could be so good at making myself look terribly happy, and even more and more happier as I actually became more and more lost.

Maybe it was the part of me that was slightly psychological that helped me in maintaining a cold heart ( yet annoyingly helpless, brittle, and ruined ), and an adjustable face; hiding my unwanted facet away from any searching eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

How did it all happen? 

Really, I thought of that question so many times; read and reread all of my memories over and over. I even did some research on my situation too. ( This is like some sociology project! ) 

( So, wow, I still have some sense of humor? I suppose it’s just how I am trained to be like over all these years. People don’t want sad-sad-sadness, or peaceful silence. They want to be pleased by. )

I came up with the conclusion that I had toxic parents. 

The description fits perfectly. 

Sure, some of you might start telling me I’m blaming it all on my parents. Oh in the name of God and all his love, shall I be grateful for all they did to me. I shall be grateful they gave me birth! Also I shall be grateful they gave me food!

Yes, sure, the list goes on, and I won’t mind naming it.

They gave me shelter, education… 

Wow, especially my mother! Yes, her.

She gave me most of all those things said above!

She even gave me a chance to drink my own vomit down from a plate because I cannot eat cheese when I was young!

Why? I shall be so grateful she bought me McDonald's when I pleaded with her to!

No, we weren’t broke. We were middle-class. And yes, I really was grateful, even when she made me drink my own vomit.

It’s all my fault isn’t it? Even now when I’ve committed to the fact that I hate them, I cannot put away my sorrow no matter what! I just knew, and I just can’t let go of the thought that all is my fault. Everything is my fault. It’s become my subconscious.

You want to hear more? 

I’ll just tell you then that my mother hurt me, both physically and verbally ( all the way to mentally ), because she feels lowly of herself, and is afraid of putting that rage of her’s anywhere else because other people will f\*\*\* her up. She’s afraid of her husband even though she hates him because he can’t do anything, is lazy, and is crazy. 

So who’s the easy target? Well, the person who believes her so much and is weaker than her, is me.

She’d just find any reason, like a single strand of hair ( literally, a single strand of hair ) on the bathroom floor, and smash and spit on me until she is pleased with herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Funnily, I was born in 2004, and my father became mentally ill in 2004 too.

He couldn’t stand to support a family without an OFFICE job. He doesn’t want to do anything else other than sit in a room and code computers, even though he can’t even be able to do a job properly without messing the program up.

So lucky me, my mother told me I was the root of all bad luck in this family, everything was because of me, my birth was a mistake that should’ve never happened. My aunt, which was once the only person I thought did love me, agreed to my mom that I was wrong and should never have been born too. 

And back then, I actually really agreed. And ridiculously, I believe that I was a mistake even now.

&amp;#x200B;

And my father? I don’t feel like talking much now. He just tried to molest me, three times.

My grandparents and my mom agree that I seduced him into f\*\*\*ing me. I guess I am a whore asking to let men f\*\*\* me for fun, even though I’m actually lesbian from the start and I have a girl I love.

( She isn’t my girlfriend though, so please don’t get it wrong. It’s all single-sided. But we are very close and she knows I like her anyway. She’s straight, and insists I’m straight when I really tried to tell her I’m not. I can rant about how amazing she is all day long, but that’s best not said now. I can’t live for her, she thinks I am just a tool to please her too. Even though I love her, I can’t, I’m just really tired. )

My mom told me I am a whore, and I am disgusting. 

Haha, funny things these days.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s… Just about it.

Other things? Like how did I hurt myself? I’m tired, I don’t want to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Come to think of it, I wasn’t asking for any justification. I just really wanted someone to love me.

Someone to shut my subconscious thoughts up, and tell me it is ok to not be okay.

I really did once want someone to sit with me in this hell, someone to be with me forever, and forgive me for everything ( ugh, my fault… Hahaha ) in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this world, how disgusting it is.

I love you all, even though you are all so meaningless and selfish.

I hope my soul perishes in hell, so I won’t have to ever wake up in any life anymore, even if I’d be happy.

This pain isn’t worth that little joy, because what I want won’t ever exist.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll go out tonight, dressed nicely, carrying a diary I thought I’d finish; 

and in the loneliness I’ve always had, I will have my salvation.

Reposted from r/Advice

This past year has been my senior year of high school, in the past 10 months I have been hit by a car, kicked out of my house by my alcoholic father and forced to live in the streets. During this time I was having a hard time coping with my emotions so I constantly felt depressed, I'm still struggling with that. My girlfriend was there for me through it all, even though I didn't expect her to. I'm currently living in a transitional living facility so she can't come and see me as often, and when she broke up with me suddenly I felt all the emotions come out at the same time.

I feel so cursed. I didn't do anything for my life to be like this. I feel as though I am just not loveable, it isn't something I deserve. I went out to the store and I bought a pack of razor blades but I'm too much of a coward to do anything to myself. People always say things pass but they certainly haven't for me. I'm seriously considering turning myself into a psych ward once again on the basis of suicidal ideation because it's all I ever think about, but I don't think my insurance could cover it.

I've been alone here most of the week for the past.. two years or so. My siblings have moved out. Of course they would, there's no future in a place like here.

Trying to live here is depressing. I have nobody to live these memories with even if I wanted to. I hated my environment, so I tried to change it. For the past year.

A deep cleaning of the house.

It was a year of pure struggle. My parents still wanted their junk, because why else would it be here for a decade. I threw out 40% of the trash. I cleared out several corners and cabinets. I encountered enough pests to put in thousands of tons of ground coffee. I hate these pests. They scare me.

My parents come back on the weekends. My dad is thankful that I'm helping them with their baggage. Of course. You couldn't care less. My mom is reluctant about throwing everything out. She searches through the bags of rubbish I have purposely stuffed for my own sanity, and keeps some of the stuff. God knows how many times I've attempted to throw one item out.

I ask them to help with cleaning. You know, it's similar to maintaining mental health. They are slow with progress, because they have different priorities in their lives. At some point my own mental health stopped being one of theirs, or maybe it never was.

I ask my dad to help out with removing the dead pests. He loves to make fun of me for being scared of the pests. They're just roaches, what's the big deal.

I've been going at it for the past year. The pests just keep coming. I don't know why. As much as they terrify me, they bring me comfort for the fact that they're almost a metaphor for my own situation.

I am terrified of being me. Everyone in my household makes fun of me for being me. I cry a lot and have intense emotions. That's a problem for my brother. I'm ""an accident"". That's a problem for my sister. ""You only have anxiety attacks because you're always on your phone and you don't sleep enough."" That's a problem for my dad.

SuicideWatch,"Hi baby, 

I don't know what'll happen tonight. I've already packed everything. I have a blanket to roll myself in tightly, all the pills I think I'll need. I need to prepare razor blades too. I'll sneak out into the forest tonight. I don't know how it'll go. Maybe if I cut myself up a bit, it'll help and ill choose to take only a bit of pills to knock myself out. I don't yet, baby. But know that you've given me more than I could've ever asked for. There's nothing you could've done, please don't blame yourself if I die. It was all me, baby. The only person who can save me is me, and I don't want to save myself. I'm sorry. I know that won't fix anything for you. I'm so sorry. I hope that you find this and recognise that it's me if I do die. Hahah, I always said that if I write a suicide letter that means it's all over for me and I've lost. It's okay, baby, you've made me the happiest person in the world. 

You're the love of my life. You're my world. You're my everything. I love you. I love you with my entire heart. Kocham cię, misiu. I hope you can tell it's me now hahaha. If not, let me write the most important word you've ever taught me: 우유. I wish I just got to hold you at least once. Feel your arms cover me and make everything disappear. Make it all okay for a night. I wish I could've kissed you, admired how beautiful you are in person. Feel your skin under my fingertips. Look into your eyes and tell you how much you mean to me. It'll be okay, baby. I know you know how much I love you. Thank you for giving me everything, for getting me through my panic attacks and comforting me when I cried and talking me through what I feel and helping me understand myself and the village inside my head. Right now it's only the homeless man and train conductor hahahah. Probably better that I 'm not letting it's population grow or discover who else is hiding in it. You make me so happy, no one but you can make my face hurt so much from smiling. If I survive tonight, I know I'll be going straight to the mental hospital. I don't think it'll be any help. 

If I don't survive, I hope this doesn't break you. I don't want to hurt you, baby. That's the absolute last thing I want to do to you. I can't live like this though, it's agony. You made my life worth it though. I got to experience your love. It was the purest, most magical thing I've ever felt. You make me feel so calm, babe. I want to fall asleep in your arms, and hear you breathing softly as you fall asleep too. I love you. I can't say that enough. 

I love you so so so sosososo much, baby. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being you. Thank you for sharing yourself with me. Thank you for getting me through each day. Tonight I have to fight it alone, I hope you understand, baby. 

Thank you for treating my heart so well. I love you forever.

Yours always,

SuicideWatch,"i was going to use a throwaway because people i know irl follow this account, but to be honest i don't really care if they see this. i just need to let this out.

so, i have several chronic illnesses/diseases, as well as severe mental health problems. i am in constant pain every day, both mentally and physically, and many people just assume i'm lying. although my conditions may be rare, they are all diagnosed and recognised by doctors, and they are very real.

i have no way of communicating how much i am suffering. and even when i do, all of the doctors and therapists just say there's nothing they can do.  apparently my constant aching and fatigue is 'incurable', and i'm 'mentally-resistant' to all medications and therapies for my mind, whatever the fuck that means.

if there's nothing nobody can do, what is meant to bhappen? am i just going to have to sit here and wait until this thing kills me? because i'd rather die in peace and when i want, then let some agonising disease do it for me.

my life is awful outside of my mental and physical health too. i am surrpunded by mentally and emotionally abuse people. i am constantly manipulated, degraded and ignored because they know my brain can't stop them. i've tried to reach out for help - i've called crisis lines, even the police. do you know what they did? said i was fucking lying. 

i self harm. i cut, i burn, i drink substances that really shouldn't be drunk.

i have seen shit that nobody should ever see, let alone a fucking child. i am 15.

if i were to 'save' myself, i don't know how i'd do it. a lot of people say that overdoses are a shitty way to go, but that's because they don't know how to do it properly. i do, which is why i'm just waiting for the drugs to come my way. hanging seems unreliable, i've tried slitting my wrists before, and i don't think i have the chemicals handy to kill myself that way either.

when pets are gravely sick, what do you do? do you let them suffer, watch them live their lives in pain because of your own selfishness? no, of course you wouldn't do that. you may love them, but you don't want them to suffer. **why is my situation any different? nobody wants to hear it, but it's true: it isn't.**

god, i wish euthanasia was legal in the UK. every night as i fall asleep, i visualise myself dying, all of the pain fading away, just slowly going into a state of peace. someday, that will become a reality. that reality is coming closer and closer to now.

i can't continue like this. stop telling me i'll get out of this situation, because i fucking wont. **i can't.** you need to understand that.

i will always be in pain.

I mentioned my suicidal thoughts to my psychiatrist multiple times and he just brushed it off every single time. Recently when I told him, he told me that ""I understand. It's a tough time, it will pass, just don't give up"", that just sounds like a ""deal with it and shut the fuck up"" to me

When I told my family....the only time I've opened up to them in years, they told me ""Don't think like that""

All my friends left because of who I am. They just wanted someone who can make them happy and my best friend....my last friend in college who stayed, told me that I have nothing to be sad about, that I'm like this again and then she moved on and on Instagram I just see how she's been hanging out with a lot of her friends and she's just better off without me

SuicideWatch,"Sometimes I'll watch movies as if some characters are surrogates for different parts of myself. Like one character represents me, another represents my suicidal ideation, yet another is the part of me that wants to live. I think it's because the concept of 'conflict' can be generalized to fit most situations, but it can help being able to relate to a movie character. For some examples:

In Little Shop of Horrors, Seymour (me) kills off more and more people (aspects of me) to appease a carnivorous plant (my suicidal ideation) until it kills him, too.

In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean (me) is constantly stalked by Javert (suicidal ideation) as he just tries to live his life to the best that he can.

In Phantom of the Opera, Christine (me) is tormented by the Phantom (suicidal ideation) as she is torn between him and her lover, Raoul (the part that wants to live).

In Portal 2 (not a movie, I know), Chell (Me) initially trusts Wheatley (suicidal ideation) until he takes over the entire facility and has to learn to trust GLaDOS (the part that wants to live).

SuicideWatch,"I am riddled with guilt. Currently in a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. As soon as I get out I am going to commit suicide, and I won’t fail this time. I guess this is my last attempt at seeking help/reassurance.
Background: I am 23F, suffer with Anorexia, OCD(Pure O), depression and BPD. 
Last year I was in a relationship with my then ex, for about 2 years. It was a pretty toxic/codependent relationship, mostly on my part due to my BPD abandonment issues, insecurity and paranoia.

I have always been very impulsive and reckless in the area of sex(as well as many other areas) never cared about using protection, always let men cum inside me etc without any form of contraception or without knowing their or my STI status. I guess I used(and still do) it as a coping mechanism or form of self harm in a way. 

My ex was always very responsible in this area and preferred to use condoms. However we did end up having a lot of unprotected sex throughout the relationship as I had told them that I wasn’t worried about contraception etc as I’d only ever had unprotected sex in the past and nothing bad had happened. I had convinced myself that I couldn’t get pregnant because of my long history with anorexia and had either no period or very irregular periods for many years. I had also never had an STI but hadn’t been checked in a while. I know this was very irresponsible of me and I feel extremely guilty over it as I could have put my ex’s health at risk. My ex persuaded me to get tested a few months into the relationship and thankfully I was all clear.

However, nearly a year into the relationship I fell pregnant. Again, I feel so terrible because I feel it was my fault that we had unprotected sex, as I was the reckless one and my ex was always very cautious about using protection. I feel like I (unintentionally) misled them that everything would be ok, because I was/am stupid and impulsive and reckless.

Anyway after about a month since finding out I was pregnant I decided to have an abortion. I was having a lot of mixed feelings at the time and went through a period of regret but I put this down to the hormones, because I knew deep down I didn’t want a kid(I have never wanted kids) and realized it was the right decision. 

I was prescribed birth control, which I had always been fearful to take because of my intense fear of weight gain due to my anorexia(I had read that can cause weight gain) and also because I have health OCD and was terrified it would cause me to get a blood clot and have a stroke(I read that BC can increase this risk). However I did start taking it. 

Our relationship kind of started going down hill around this time, I had started a new job as an exotic dancer, which I loved and was beginning to lose interest in the relationship, but I was very much in denial about it at the time. 
I hardly ever wanted to have sex anymore with my then partner which was obvs very upsetting and hurtful to them. And I feel  kind of bad and anxious to say this but I feel like every time we had sex wasn’t entirely consensual, as I was very disinterested but I feel like my partner kept pestering me for it even though I obviously didn’t want to. 

But this is one of the things that has me riddled with guilt and suicidal, after a while I was only sporadically taking my birth control, as well as the fears I described previously, I guess I just didn’t really care about taking it? I didn’t even want to be having sex with my partner, but I didn’t tell them I wasn’t taking it properly. And I guess I was still being my reckless impulsive self, not caring what happened to me etc. My memory is very hazey from around this time, I was going through a lot, had had another suicide attempt around this time and had spent some time in the psych ward. I am now wracking my brain trying to remember exactly what happened and it’s driving me crazy. I can’t remember exactly how often I wasn’t taking the pill. but there was a couple of times that I just went out and bought the morning after pill when I thought there was an increased risk of getting pregnant. For example one night my partner came inside me, I didn’t take my prescribed pill in the morning(just told my partner I forgot) but did go out and buy the morning after pill. I don’t know why I have less anxiety about taking that than the regular pill but anyway. 

So here I am a year later in the psych ward again and here’s why: A few days ago I came across a post on Instagram about “Rape by deceit” which said sex cannot be consensual if you do something such as lying about your STI status or lying that you’re on birth control when you’re not. Well, my world came crashing down around me. I am now convinced that this is what I have done and I cannot live with myself because of it.

I guess I’m scared, and overcoming survival instinct seems really hard. But I feel like I should be able to do it and don’t understand why I can’t.

SuicideWatch,"(I'm sorry if I make some mistakes, I'm still learning english) my mother told me when my brother was a baby he was very loud and I was the opposite. when I  cried she didn't pick me up till I fall asleep because I wasn't crying loud enough. 
20 years later she didn't change. she took care of my brother, loving him and supporting him all the time and I am very grateful for that since he is my brother and I only wish him the best but she left me alone, she judge me, insult me all the time , wishing me to die every day, given punches on my back while I was sleeping and after I couldn't breathe. telling my brother while he is beating me to do it harder, humiliating me in public, with my friends, teachers, making fun of me, having no social life because I was beaten if I was late and then I just didn't want to go anywhere because I wanted to avoid all of screams and slaps from my dad and I got used to it and now I can't have a normal relationships with anyone and that includes school or job. 
I lived for years knowing that I should repress anything and not feel weak. I shouldn't feel like I have to be loved because it's lame.
every person of my age never said something positive about me because I was cold and I acted like I didn't need it so they slowly were gone from my life. I looked so not interested all the time and I never reached them. 
I was very apathetic and distant and I barely talked. 
I never felt being alone since I was always by myself, I don't know the difference. 
I never did the things that teenagers do, having a boyfriend or girlfriend, going out for parties, having groups, smoking, going out in the night, drinking, having the first kiss ecc. 
I was convinced in my head that I don't deserve those things, I'm not the kind of person that should have those things or having fun, those are not the things that I deserve. 
and of course my mom told me that no one is gonna love me or be with me because I'm just don't have anything to love for. 
the only thing that my mom tells me to do it's house work, it's the only thing that comes out of her mouth when she calls me. when I'm in the state that I can't get out of my bed she just doesn't care and punches me or yell at me, insult me, wish me to die just because I'm not doing what she wants. 
she talks to me just when she needs me and I just don't want to do it if that's the only reason. 
when I was at the psychiatrist my parents were talking and insulting me all the time in front of her and the worst part is that she agreed and gave me a medicine for kids ( I was 17 years old) and told me it's my fault that it's not working and my parents till this day say to me that it's my fault that I am the way that I am (depressed) because I decide to be like this. 
I can't go to school or having a job because I don't have the mental and physical strength. 
it's been more than 4 years that I don't have friends, I only talk to people online witch I'm not friends with them anymore because the only thing that they did to me is hurting me repeatedly and using me for attention for years. 
I'm all alone in a country that I don't know the language, I don't know no one and I don't have anything.
I'm currently in the situation where I am continuously repeated in my face that I should get out of the house because no one cares about me.
I want to get out but I don't have any money and I can't have a job in this state. 
my mental state it's getting at the point that I don't have any strength to kill myself since I am so weak.
I really don't have anything to live for, I just don't feel life in me.
and if I hear someone say it will get better I can't comprehend how is it possible for someone to be so selfish and not understand that there is nothing to be better for people like me.
there is nothing to adjust, there is just nothing. 
so please don't console me, don't help me to live when I don't want to and help me to get out of this situation.",why I want to kill myself,t3_gs97l7,1

SuicideWatch,"Hi im 21 years old and I rarely do this so im sorry if it comes off as mindless rambling

Lately ive been feeling just a immense feeling of failure and lonesomeness and its started to entertain suicidal thoughts which isnt like me and its terrifying and upsetting 

For context my girlfriend of 3 years (LDR) and I have become progressively distant, some of it due to her and school but i also just get this feeling she doesnt feel the same towards me anymore and it kind of just hurts
i try to be proactive and talk to her and be affectionate but also give her space cause i dont wanna smother, so it just feels like a balancing act that im doing by myself but also like im slowly failing, so i cant help but feel a tad defeated i suppose

Another reason is the other day one of my close friends of about 3 years as well called me when i asleep so i missed it, when i woke up about an hour later i saw it but there was no follow up text so i thought i was too late and moved on with my day, later in the day i got a text from their gf saying they were mad and upset with me
I immediately felt bad so i dm’d them saying “sorry anon” but hadnt got a response for about 20 minutes, after that i tried to call them (idk it sounded like a good idea at the time) after about 5 minutes of ringing they answered but didnt say anything, i didnt say anything initially either cause i wasnt sure what to say to be honest, after about an awkward half minute of silence saying “hello?” 
he didnt respond but his gf did and was laughing while saying how mad he was
i tried to tell him “im sorry anon, i didnt mean to upset you” but still no response
so i sat there in silence confused and not sure what to do, i wasnt sure if it was a joke so i fooled around for about a minute but still silence, and i know he was there cause he would talk to his gf, eventually he hung up and i dont know what to think
i feel bad and i guess i was in the wrong but i didnt know it would be that much of a problem and now they havent sent a message in awhile and its just upsetting man

my parents have been fighting alot lately as well and ive had to break it up before it got physical and its an awful feeling, and my grandpa (my moms dad) died about two months ago in a freak accident at his job, and its just been so surreal to deal with

i dont know how to describe it but i feel like theres butterflies in my stomach but not the good kind, the kind where im scared for whats to come, i feel like all my friends are leaving cause im not consistent enough, i try to talk to my girlfriend to respark the conversation but it feels like it falls on deaf ears, and i feel like my home is falling apart and my family is at each others throats 

im a very lucky person to even have some of these things, but with how things are turning i dont know if i can handle it, it sounds really dumb but i just cant handle the stress anymore, i feel physically tired from the constant mindgames with myself and i shake when i think about getting that message that she wants to move on, or the silence from people who i thought were close to me, or the chaos in my own home

For some backround information about me, I am a fourteen year old british kid, who identifies as male despite being AFAB, and i also have autism. I am unsure if my identity will change in the future, but as of right now being referred to as a girl or a she makes me want to cry.

Im not sure if what im feeling is a product of puberty, as ive been feeling like i want to die since i was around eight, a year before i hit puberty, but its definitely made it worse. I also believe i MAY have depression and possibly anxiety, however that could just be hormones talking. Ive had symptoms of both illnesses since i was five. It sounds weird i know, but I definitely remember showing symptoms. Maybe my head made it up. 

Any way, Ive been seriously considering suicide for a while now. For the past five or so years its been passive, despite a brief period when i was ten when i almost went through with it, but as of now its gotten BAD. It all started about a month ago, when The Man Behind The Slaughter had just became a meme. I saw a post about breaking your thumb ligament and my brain instantly noted it as a way to self harm, which sent me down a rabbit hole and made me cry for the first time since i was around twelve. I didnt even cry when two of my dogs were put down and they meant the world to me. Anyway, not a day later, someone told my friend to go 'down the river next time retard' and i defended them. that someone proceeded to call me a retard multiple times, as well as calling me a failed abortion and told me to jump of a building, which was enough to drive me to self harm via cutting. I have been doing it occasionally since, as well as biting myself. 

the quarantine has been tough on me too, and ive been so bored recently that killing myself feels like the only good option besides sitting down doing nothing but mindlessly play ACNH or watch youtube. ive also not been able to sleep at normal times for longer than i can remember. this is bad because my Bad Thoughts get worse at night and im scared of the dark despite being a nightowl. 

anyway i just feel really helpless, useless, and that suicide is the only way to fix it. i dont even want to get help because im not a person beyond my sadness and i dont want to find out who i am without it in case im an even worse person. one of the only reasons i havent given up on my fear of death already is that i really want to catch up on One Piece before i die. i know its pathetic to hinge your life off of an anime that hasnt even ended, but its really the one thing i look forward to doing and even THEN i procrastinate it.

I can’t tell me friends or anybody. You might say that I have moments where I’m genuinely happy. But I’m not. Ever happy. Ever. Even when I’m with my horse. She makes me happier than anybody.

SuicideWatch,"My sister constantly harrasses and bullies me day after day and I've felt so worthless recently to the point where I don't even feel like I deserve to live anymore because I view myself as such a terrible person. She spreads lies about me all the time, threatens to take away my only friends by 'exposing' me being a terrible person. She does this probably every week and they're my only friends that I have. I cry myself to sleep almost every night in fear that I lose everything I've ever had. She fat shames me, tells me (very specifically) to 'slit my wrists in the bathtub', and she says it's fine because she said it like a month ago, but she doesn't understand it doesn't matter if it was a long time ago. A few days ago I even considered cutting myself because I wanted to feel something other than sadness for once. She told me to kill myself countless times last year, and although she doesn't anymore the pain still doesn't go away. I've been losing motivation to even get out of bed in the morning or even be hygenic and she always mocks me for it, calling me ugly and saying I 'eat too much and I should go on a diet'. She purpously brings up controversial topics so that I can say something I don't mean and then use it against me. Then it makes me feel like I'm a horrible person and I don't deserve anything and ends up with me breaking down crying. We fight almost everyday and I feel like there's no escape. I have considered suicide a couple times this year because I just felt to trapped. This probably doesn't matter, but she's self-diagnosed with ADHD and OCD too. Whenever she tells her story everyone believes her and views me as a bad person. I feel like this will never change because whenever I try to reason with her she doesn't listen. All of her friends don't know what she actually acts like. Also, she is going to therapy soon but that's on hold because of coronavirus, so there's no hope for that anytime soon.

SuicideWatch,"I really do wish I could kill myself. Not because I’m depressed. I may not have many friends but I’m hardly lonely. I have a caring and loving family whom would give their lives for me. Though we don’t have much money they’d buy me anything if I’d ask. I’ve never been a victim to bullying. Never been raped or sexually assaulted? Never experienced tragedy or anything of the sort.

Sometimes I wish my parents didn’t raise me right. Raised me to be someone who deserved to die. That way I could actually go through with it. But they ended up making a decent human being who cares for people. In the end that’s the only reason I don’t do it. Because I’m scared.

I’m not scared of dying. If I could die without any repercussions at all, I’d have done it a long long time ago. I’m scared of what my death will bring. The saying “death will only breed more death” would reign true if I end up taking my own life. 

My parents would feel like they failed in raising both their kids.

I feel my mother would go next given the fact she’s already depressed and blames herself a lot. Not to mention her, albeit rare, suicidal thoughts which I seem to have inherited from her. She still blames herself for my runaway sister. I blame myself for that too. And it would seem I’m making the same decisions that she did. Though she isn’t going to kill herself.

My father would presumably be next after my mother. My father, whom I’ve never known to cry in my 17 years on this god forsaken planet, still cry’s for my runaway sister and still prays at night for her safety. He would become a man who had lost his daughter, his son, and his wife. I fear he’d take his own life as well. Until only my sister remains. Perhaps he’d find comfort in drink again. As he did before he gave it up for my sister and I. But I feel that’d not be enough. It’d more likely just make it worse.

I’ve thought about my own death countless times for the past 5 or so years now. And it always comes to the thought of what will happen after. Because I’d then be responsible for my family’s eventual demise. 

Even so, can I still put up with this life I’ve mistakenly been given? Can I still live in wait for an approximate 30 or 40 years after my parents eventual deaths? I’m not sure I could.

I’m only a junior in high school and I can already see my education in the toilet. Even if I do get my education, I’d still have to get up for a job that I’ll hate and end up despise.

It is going to be my fault for everything though. I put myself in this position. And now I’m intentionally digging the hole deeper. I have only 4 hours left to potentially pass my junior year. Still with 8 weeks of school work to do. My procrastination problem has reached its peak. I’d like to think My laziness is inate but I also know that’s how I made myself. I’ll most likely end up failing this semester and make it up next year only to repeat the flawed process 

And what do I blame? This damned virus.

It doesn’t justify the decisions I’ve made. Or not made in this instance. But if I were still to physically go to school, I’d have passed without a doubt. It was only ever homework I refused to do. And since ALL my school work became homework, this damned pandemic inadvertently fucked me over. But I did it to myself as well.

Perhaps my parents would stay alive if the virus took me instead. That way they wouldn’t feel as though they failed. But even then I’d probably survive. And give my parents an unpayable medical bill considering we have no health care. They already have enough financial problems as it is. 

I suppose one can only hope. Right?

I am so tired of this. Tired, tired, tired, tired, tired, tired of waking up crying and going to bed sad knowing that the next day will be more miserable than the previous day. I am tired of writing depressing poems and feeling guilty about the fact that I’ve only writing about sad, dark sh*t. 
I am tired of feeling like I’m slowly drowning, knowing that I have no one to rely on. I don’t have a friend and my parents don’t want to associate with me, despite the fact that I’m home all the time and I don’t even have a social media presence. My brother threatened to beat me up yesterday in front of my parents and they didn’t react, even indirectly. They’re so hypocritical. The second I demand peace from my siblings, all hell breaks loose and me releasing my anger that has built up over a LONG period of time, without me hurting anyone, results in mom calling the police. They say that I am the problem, although I’ve worked on my toxic traits. How can it be me when I’ve done all I can to live peacefully? My mental health is so shitty I can’t even stand up without me breaking into tears and having this burden on my shoulders just makes me feel so worthless. If my parents don’t care, who will? My suicidal thoughts escalated gradually. It started with me making light jokes about death and shifting towards a nihilistic approach to life, although I’m religious. It definitely worsened yesterday when I talked to my teachers and I might fail two of my classes. With everything going on in my life, it’s been impossible to prioritise schoolwork. I’ve always imagined myself becoming a doctor, but that thought seems impossible now, when I might not graduate. (I’ve always been a very academic and ambitious person). My brain is going to explode I hate hate hate hate myself for thinking like this. Sometimes I think about how my situation is so little compared to people going through a lot worse. 

Yesterday I did what I would never imagine myself doing. I looked up ways to kill myself and felt oddly comfortable knowing that I could decide which day I would die. My mind is so foggy so i don’t know if I’m even expressing myself clearly enough. Another thing is that I’ve always seen myself dying young, I can remember me telling mom this as a child. Maybe this is destiny for me.

I miss having someone significant in my life that felt for me the same way I did for them, ever since I lost those feelings for Tishell, it's been impossible to remake that essence. Unfortunately, it's not something I can go back to any of my exes to remake, it just really doesn't work.

My mother is a difficult person to deal with, my father can be difficult to me but for different reasons. My mother means well in almost everything she does for me, I appreciate it deeply, but her execution just doesn't fit for some reason. I don't take much initiative for things I don't care about, chores is a part of the many things I don't care for. She expects me to want to do these things out of love for her and my family, but I won't do things I don't want to do unless I'm asked or if it's for a greater good. She doesn't like that and takes my lack of initiative as unappreciative and disrespectful behavior. Not only that, but it feels like she puts the position of a mother higher than it should be. Yeah, you gave birth to me but I didn't ask for that, so that kinda cushions a lot of your argument. Yeah, you raised me, thanks. However, not only was it partially out of obligation, and it's not as if anyone could take up the role of caretaker. That may seem like an insensitive opinion, but at the same time, if you give someone a baby and they choose not to abort it, in today's society I believe it's not only their responsibility but their job to take care of that child. At which point, it's immoral to hold it over the child's head that you raised them and birthed them. At that point, you asked for it, they still didn't. 

School has always been something I've detested growing up, as it always felt forced. That's because it was. I've now graduated from high school, class of 2020. No prom or graduation, I'm not exactly upset about either. I just want my money back for the portion of student dues that I paid for things I won't get to experience. Now, I look for higher education. I'm going to a local community college. My grades are barely acceptable, and I don't even know what I'm going for. I picked a community college since it'd be free and I don't want to financially commit. What I really want to do with my life is teach guitar, or do something in relation to sound or music. Only problem is that I'm still learning myself, I'm starting to realize YouTube videos aren't going to teach me very well anymore so I'm going to need real lessons if that's what I plan on. 

I work at chipotle, it sucks. Some of my coworkers suck, most are great to work with. There's not much to expand on there.

I think about death and suicide all the time. It happens in random bursts. Sometimes I'll begin to daydream about stealing a police officer's gun from their waste and shooting myself in the forehead, like something out of a movie. Or maybe since I'm black, I'll just do something provoking and get them to shoot me. Maybe I'll take a trip to the shooting range one day and make it happen then. Irregardless of how I die, I can say almost certainly that if I find myself in a situation that could cost me my life, I would hesitate to escape from it. 

Why do I want to die so much? I feel like my life is nothing. It means something to my friends and family, but it doesn't mean anything to me. I'm quite tired of living in a world that works the way this one does, and yeah, you can say ""the world has problems, deal with it"". That's a fair way to think, but at the same time, I'm free to think and feel whatever I want. I'm free to want to die, and I'm free to go out and die so long as I'm not bringing harm to anyone else in the process. I don't think I have what it takes to follow my dreams, my web of friends has fallen apart, my family isn't the right one for me, and I can't find the significant love that I lost. That's why I'd rather die than keep living, not to mention I'm really curious in general as to what it's like to be dead. 

Even though I feel all of these things, I'm not going to kill myself any time soon. Mostly because I don't want to fuck it up and end in a lot of pain, but also because I don't feel like going through all the trouble of killing myself.",I just stopped and noted how I feel and what I was thinking.

Everyday for the past decade has been the same, just spending in front of a computer screen, behind a locked door. When I went to school, I spent my time there isolated. I never learned how to socialize or make friends, so I just stared at my phone and waited until 3pm. Now I'm twenty and haven't made any process. I can't get a job because I'm too pathetic.

 I met Sarah about a month ago on Instagram, we bonded over art and webtoon, we were just talking about each other and she asked me for anything interesting about me, so I told her a bunch of random stuff, I then told her I was bisexual, and she was the first person I told, and I told her that. She then was all like ""wow, it's ok, I am a lesbian myself, but if my family found out I would be disowned, or  probably hit."" That surprised me and we somewhat talked about it. She then asked if I was going through anything, and I told her I was going through perfectionism, and we got to talking about how the pandemic was affecting us. She then asked me if she could tell me something and I said sure, she then told me that her dad sexually assaults her and has been doing it since she was 7. I then asked her some questions, telling her constantly that she doesn't have to answer any of them. I found out that he touches her about 2 times a week, she has tried to tell her mother but she doesn't believe Sarah, her dad doesn't do it to her sisters, that she doesn't ever fight back and is very skinny, short and vulnerable, and every time she sleeps she has a nightmare of her dad assaulting her. All I know about where she lives is in the united states and her time zone, so I can't help with any laws, but she doesn't want to get her family into any legal trouble, she still cares about her family and doesn't want to harm them. Due to all of this, she harms herself and has stopped eating. Her sister who is 13 hits her daily for no reason at all, or if she annoys her in any way, Sarah always apologizes and cries when it happens(crying is seen as weak in her family). 

We have been talking nonstop for the past month, and one time she was talking bad about herself and that she deserves to die, I didn't know what to say and how to get her to stop, so I said stop it or I will ignore you.(I know this was very wrong, and I shouldn't have said it) she then stops and starts apologizing, begging me not to leave her, and that she really doesn't want me too. This is where I realized how much I messed up, and I apologize, and I won't leave her. She seemed to calm down some but kept begging me not to leave her, and that she will change, she will do anything I want. A day passed and she hasn't told me anything that happens so I told her I was deeply sorry and I will try my best to prove to her she can trust me again, she told me none has done that for her before and that we can work on it. this was 2 weeks ago, and we are good now, but she is struggling and has no idea what to do about her family, and I have no idea how to help. I really need some advice on how to help Sarah, what she should do, and how to get her dad to stop sexually abusing her.

SuicideWatch,"So when I was around 8 something happened and my father left and it was just me and my mother. This means we lost the house. 


I can remember a ton of events from 5-8 and a ton of events from 10-now


But during that time when we lost the house we stayed with a woman from our church that reached out to my mother and offered to let us stay with her for about a year. 


I vividly remember walking into the woman’s house and being shown a room and told this is where you’ll sleep, here’s the tv blah blah


Now here’s the thing. After that day I can’t recall any memories in that house, even though my mother said we were there for around a year. I can’t remember the house, being driven there from school, where it was, or even a single meal I ate there, nothing but the memory of arriving and being shown my room. 


Is it possible I was abused or drugged or something while I was at that house?


Conveniently that’s also when I started going from the type of student where teachers said I was way above my reading level, etc to stuttering if I had to read a single sentence in class, and my grades dropping dramatically.  And that’s also conveniently when I discovered I enjoyed pain in the genital area which developed into a fetish that still haunts me.

Usually I just read or upvote on reddit and don’t write so much myself.

I’m writing this because I’ve been wondering about pain during self-harm or suicide.
I’ve been cutting my skin for a while now whenever I get one of these days and almost daily I imagine all the different ways how to end it.
I never could go too far though. 

While you barely feel light cuts whenever I tried to go really deep with the blade it hurt a lot which scared me again. It’s not making me want to life again or makes me afraid to die - I’m just afraid of the pain Inexperience shortly before death.
I feel numb all day long yet if I get too deep cuts I back off out of pain.
That’s why I mostly imagine about swallowing pills.

Because this is being posted at 3 am on a somewhat popular subreddit, I don’t think this will get any attention whatsoever, but I don’t know what to do so I’m just going to speak my mind. I hate my life so fucking much. I honest to god don’t know why. I live in a good house with a good family, and an active social life, and every day I come home and feel just as lonely as the last. 

I feel like no one in my life actually cares about me. They care about me for their own self benefit. My parents say they care about me but they just want to say they have a son that is successful.

My friends don’t care about me. They turn on me the moment I get real about anything. I’m always a background character in everybody’s life. Everyone just likes me because I’m fake about my personality to everyone I meet so I can appear cool.

The one person who got me, my first gf broke up with me a month ago and I haven’t talked to her since. She was perfect for me, and we both liked each other but she doesn’t think a relationship in high school can work.

I had a party today, where everyone around me felt like they were being fake. Everyone looked like they were having fun when I wasn’t there. I just want to be liked and respected by someone, anyone that i can likewise respect.

I’ve attempted suicide before, and it ended with me becoming isolated by my friends and treated differently. I just want to die. I see no future for myself. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t have friends. I just want to walk to downtown in the middle of the night and jump off the biggest thing I can see.

I have a diploma in IT that i obtained back in 2018. I wanted to take some time of because I felt really depressed at the end of the diploma also I wanted to find work. 

Honestly, I was not prepared for life. I don't know how to self-learn. I thought it would be easier than this when I was younger. My resume is shit, i have no discernable accomplishments despite working hard to get a good gpa for my diploma, even then its only 3.56. I felt little interest in programming because I was always had trouble trying to understand programming.  I got depressed, turned to the only thing i felt happy in, video games and porn.

I stopped porn but sexual thoughts still linger on and off. I told myself i'm gonna work harder now, try my best to get my degree even though I don't exactly like it.

SuicideWatch,"Today I’m 16 and still living with my parents. I got C’s and B’s in middle school because I didn’t care to study, and I’m getting B’s, C’s, and some A’s in sophomore year. My dad always tells me that I need to do my best in everything I try, but my nature is to half-ass or not even attempt schoolwork. 

I don’t know if I’m allowed to think that I’m not fit for living in this world. On one hand, it’s wasting all the money and years of time that my parents took to raise me. I got in an argument with them earlier today and my mom said I should just get emancipated because it would finally make for a calm household. I also believe that my behavior contributes to my mom’s depression, and on multiple occasions she said that she should just kill herself, or that no one would care if she died, likely because of my arguments with my parents. I would still be a burden and likely not be able to find independence as a college student or as an adult. I don’t know how I’m supposed to discipline myself to start studying hard and do well in school, and find a field that I would enjoy working in. On the other hand, there’s millions of people that do what they hate every day just to survive. I would be wasting the opportunity that is living in a privileged neighborhood with well-off parents, and for what? Because I can’t be bothered to put in hard work like everyone else on this planet?

SuicideWatch,"All of the courses I would like to take, all of the careers I would like to have, everything I want out of life — all these things involve putting ideas out into the world. I want to write, or complete academic research, or edit, or translate, but all of that seems so inherently narcissistic. Why would I assume that anyone would care to hear what *I* have to say? I was completing some research this morning and came across so many beautifully written, cogent peer-reviewed articles. Pathetically, reading them made me want to cry. I realised that I will never be able to produce something so lovely. I will never get to that point. I have absolutely no semblance of a promising future. Unintelligent, uninteresting, talentless, worthless — how could I be so conceited to think that I would ever deserve to have my writings published, let alone even study the arts?

I hate myself so deeply for all of this, and that, too, is egotistical. I must be so disgustingly self-involved to be constantly analysing myself, constantly psychologising my wishes.

I wish I were someone, anyone else. There are so many wonderfully bright and optimistic people around me. They are brimming with self-confidence, and they should be, because they possess skills and intellect that are leagues away from my own.

I don't believe I can contribute anything of worth to the world.

SuicideWatch,"I feel like I'm… not really anything.

I lost out on experiencing my younger years - first out of introversion, then out of depression, self-hatred, and fear of rejection. I've only ever wanted to have a teeming, rich life with close friends, to feel the blind, unbound passion of young love, to know the joy of being valued and desired by someone else and to share in the world's wonder and mystery together… 

But it never came to pass. I never did any of those things, and to this day I have never smoked weed or dropped acid, I've never gone to a party or a concert with friends, never went on joy-rides, road-trips, or go to museums… Never been asked out, never been kissed, never so much as held hands or stared longingly into the eyes of an interested other… never had awkward first-time sex, better second-time sex, never got the chance to eat a girl out, any of that. That part of my life, with all of its promise and romance, is hopelessly gone, perished into the ever-waxing past.

Graduation was five years ago. All those people I used to know, friends and peers alike, have moved on in their lives, grown and experienced the world for good and ill. They've performed in plays, wrote music, studied philosophy and ecology. They've attended dour-but-hip goth raves and tripped miles in the desert sun. They've struggled, questioned and second-guessed, switched majors three or four times… but lived and lived as well as they could, and their kaleidoscopic brilliance and talent will outshine them all.

As for me? Nothing. If I missed out on life during high school, it would only make sense that I'd miss out on life in college, too. Where everyone else was building themselves and their careers, I have merely worked, on and off for five years. Saving money I suppose, but hardly living - and all the while, whiling away my spare time on trivialities, minutiae and useless hobbies. The feeling of always being behind has followed me through the years, but not so much as today. I could've been so much more at the age I am now, 23. I could've been a young up-and-coming artist, a guitarist in a band, could've been part of a greater collective spirit. But in my maladaptive reticence, I've stayed inside, retreated into my own little world, one without texture or rhythm, and I've suffered for it. Forever the late-bloomer, even in the passing of youth.

""If only I had applied myself."" So goes the saying when it's assumed that you can muster the will to find motive and reason, and force yourself into action, when you know what you want and have a clear sense of direction. I can't and don't, for whatever reason, and no one seems to understand that, hardly myself even.

These last few years, with all of their discouraging subtleties, have worn me thin. I had contended with Pure-O and depression for the first two years out of school, something which plunged my sense of self far into the churning mantle of the earth. I became more neurotic, more skittish, more anxious and inconsiderate. I've alienated people with whom I was once close, and marred relations with family and friends… yeah.

And in drifting through these tidal cycles of avoidance and habit, I developed a paralysing social anxiety and an addiction to pornography… And I hate porn. It's crude, insensitive, misogynistic, and intended to appeal solely to the male gaze. But it kept the loneliness at bay, for a time. It distracted me from myself - how much I despise my body, how I abhor even brief glances at myself in the mirror, how less-than-endowed I am, how chubby, short… I could go on forever. Self-love is not within my capability. Suffice it to say I am forever lorn of it even in that most personal of regards.

…I've tried to improve myself. I tried to get my driver's license, tried to lose weight and take better care of myself, tried to keep in touch with family and friends despite my social ineptitude, tried for school and moving out of my parents' house, even scheduled a therapy appointment for ADD, though I'm on a long waiting list now. For a time I thought it was possible to get better, that is, until this latest catastrophe among many swept across the world. I've been unemployed for a few months now since the beginning of this pandemic, the same sob-story as untold others I'm sure. But all I've worked for in the past year or so is withering under the nothingness of everyday spent at home, stuck repeating the same ritual and never progressing… Everything has gotten worse.

Amid this pandemic and the generally shambled state of the world today, there are few bright spots to grasp for. The country that I was born and raised in, a country that I refuse to exalt but the only home I've ever known, is haplessly slipping further into the clinch of authoritarianism and corruption. Whatever paltry semblance of democracy we may have had is eroding and yielding to the tide of fascism, and I do not believe that is hyperbolic to say. Growing discord and civil-strife, geopolitical tension, and an increasingly bleak socio-economic outlook… the list goes on and on. But the one that towers above the rest, for me, is the fact that against the backdrop of this tumult, there looms the ultimate existential threat of ecological catastrophe - the one thing that if nothing else, will do us all in. Ever the peachy reminder. So much to look forward to!

…Am I being ungrateful? Am I being selfish? Is this soliloquy getting tiresome yet? I've lived life thus far with less than half of what other people have endured, dealing with things that stronger people would otherwise have the will to overcome, even at their lowest points. Yet, I cannot help but feel frustrated, helpless, and hopeless - like I'm half of a person with no motivation, no talent, no direction. I want to experience life to its fullest. I want to be someone that matters, to do something that has weight, a positive impact. I want freedom, I want depth. I want creativity and flourishing. I want human connection, deep lasting love, something other than my own habitual inhibitions… It just seems that I'm my biggest obstacle to any of that.

Is there any hope?

SuicideWatch,"This is probably pretty common. I was raised in a cult with very strict rules and expectations about gender roles. I was born female, I am non binary gender fluid. I am single, 25, I have no kids and I work. All things that according to how I was raised means I'm a failure.

By 19 I should have been married, by 25 i should have 3 kids at least. And i definitely should not be working, because i should have been a stay at home mom. And honestly that is what I want to do. I hate the religion I left, it fucking sucks, but the one thing that actually fit was being a stay at home mom I really do want that. But because I havent achieved that yet I'm a failure to most of my family, just one brother and his wife and kids and one uncle I never talk to have also left that religion.

I have no schooling, no savings, a low paying job, no marketable skills for remote jobs besides customer service and call centers are literal hell. I have no prospects for a good future and its killing me every day.

I barely lasted a year at most of the jobs I've had. I worked 5 years at a hardware store, but it just about drove me into the hospital.

But the thing is, I havent actually contemplated killing myself since I was 14. I wrote a note, put it in an envelope and addressed it to my mom. Then I hid it, forgot about it and found a way to work through my feelings by writing fiction with a friend. Cue a year later when I found the note again and re read it to see how far I had gotten. The envelope had been ripped open and it was obvious someone had read it. At the first read through i didnt notice it, but then i saw in the margins a correction to a term i used. Someone had read this suicide note that wasn't dated so to them could have been very recent. And instead of trying to get me help they fucking corrected my grammar and PUT IT BACK LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. And to top it all off like a nice fucking cherry I recognized the hand writing because no one else in my family wrote that way except my mom.

What kind of fucked up person reads a suicide note from their child, addressed to them as the reason they want to die, and doesn't do fucking anything except correct their grammar. Did she want me to die? Did she want me to kill myself so that she wouldnt have to deal with me anymore?

I've cut her out of my life, it fucking hurts, but I cant live in her shadow constantly with her manipulation and underhanded attempts to make me rely on her for everything. But I'm still in a dark place.

I actually got suicidal today. I called out of work, because I didnt have the energy to do anything except cry about how useless I am. And I feel fucking guilty as hell and like I cant fucking do anything right. And all day I could hear her voice ""you should have gone to school then you'd have a better job."" ""You should have gone to the singles thing at church because then you would be married."" ""You shouldn't have cut your hair like that because now no one wants to be seen with you, especially me."" ""You cant leech off of other people forever, someday you'll need to prove you are an adult."" ""You shouldn't need meds to control your ADHD but you left Jesus so now it's your fault you feel like this."" ""If you hadn't gotten that tattoo you would be way better off in life, sinners arent winners.""

And it just goes on and on and it never fucking stops and I'm so sick of it I just want it to stop, but i want to shove it in her face when i prove to myself that i can be happy and successful without that horrible cult. But it feels like that will never ever happen and it feels like shes right and then a sentence that everyone in that cult says about people who leave pops in my head. I even said this when I was a believer. ""You'll come back. You'll realise you made a mistake by leaving. You'll come back, they always do."" And I want to go back. It would mean facing all the smug faces of my family as I prove them right. It would be so simple to go back and find a man who will marry me and give me kids, but I'll have to play 1950s house wife and be perfect and prim and proper and indoctrinate my kids into a religion that hurts so many people and act like I'm happy all the time and I hate the idea of that, but then how is that different than every single fucking day in my life where I put on my customer service face just so I can smile at my friends and family and they'll believe me when i say I'm fine, how are you.

If you read this far, dont worry. I'm too fucking scared of the void waiting after death to actually end it all, at least for tonight. I just needed to get this out and actually feel like it's possible someone will listen, even if they dont really care.

I'm empty, I dont feel good or bad about it all, I feel empty and I'm so ready to not feel empty but I cant seem to figure out how to make myself work like a normal person.

I'm stuck, like a pebble that dreams of being a tree some day, static and unchanging other than being worn down by storms and temperature changes, when really i want to grow tall, feel the sun, grow leaves and have little seedlings pop up around me and I help them grow. Itll never happen. I know I'm young, but at this point I can tell. It wont happen and I'm not sure why I keep hoping for it. I dont even know what love feels like.

Thanks for reading. I'll be fine for tonight. I sincerely hope no one feels like I do, I wouldnt wish this on anyone ever, no one deserves this. I know that's a hopeless thing to hope for considering the sub I'm on, but I still do.

SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday was a low point for me mentally, and for the first time, I called a suicide hotline to help me. This time I knew that if I didn't do that, I would actually take action on my thoughts. For some background, I got myself out of a 3-year depression without telling anyone, until I was out of it. This year was a relatively smooth one, but isolation really drove me to a new territory. My anxiety made me have to take meds to calm me down and thoughts of death really being persistent. 

I don't know why I'm even doing a post but to those who need it, it really comforts you, knowing that there is someone that cares at that moment of time. The person who I spoke to was so kind and understanding. I encourage you to do the same and talk to someone, if it wasn't for her, I would've gone through with my plans.",So I called a hotline eventually.,t3_gs1wyg,1

SuicideWatch,"Hello

I (26F) have wanted to kill myself since I was a kid. I was first put in a 72hr hold psych hold when I was 12. I was physically abused by my parents as a kid to the point where my body is now in constant pain and I have issues with my spine and hips. My cousin sexually abused me when I was a kid. 

I have tried to work hard as an adult. I got a degree in Microbiology. After I couldn't find a job in that field , I taught myself coding and got a job as a software engineer only to lose my job because I had a drink at lunch (A coworker found out and told on me).  I currently work as a cam model but I fucking hate it. Right now its hard to exercise because of the pain so my body is a on the soft side (I have a belly) and I am self conscious about my spine. and I don't make as much money as girls with perfect bodies. I fucking hate doing it, I don't want to go online but I have to in order to pay my rent. I do not have anyone to help me monetarily. 

I suffer from severe PTSD  and Borderline Personality Disorder. I have severe dissociation to the point where I am not present enough to be able to drive, so I would have to find a work at home job but I can't seem to land one. I just pretty much give up at this point. I was in a relationship with a really great and supportive guy but then I fucked it up because of my Borderline Personality. I was a bitch. I hurt him a lot and I regret it. I hate my life. i have the worst luck and I do not want to be here. 

I can get percocet and xanax and alcohol and mix it all together. Does anyone know how much perc I would need?",I do not have anything,t3_gs1lbk,1

SuicideWatch,"I've dropped from (approximately) 220 pounds to 193 in the span of 8 months. I've recently decided to learn how to ride a bicycle. I have a few hobbies. I was promoted to a board member for my uni's writing club. I've gotten told that I'm sweet and even a bit attractive. 

And despite all that, I feel empty and I feel like there's something missing. I see all these people around me with their own lives, all these relationships while I barely have anyone. Nobody contacts me first and I have to reach out to people first and even when I try to talk, it's mostly one word responses. People talk over me, get angry when I try standing up for myself even a little. I think I'm bipolar; I check a lot of the boxes. I've had depression since I was 10; I didn't need a therapist to figure that one out. 

I'm still a virgin at 22, and could end up being one at 30 at the rate I'm going. I'm not kissless and I've had ONE relationship... but that ended after 3 days when I found out she was cheating. Absolutely EVERYONE around me talks about sex like it's nothing. So don't come in here and tell me that's what it is. It's easy for you to say when you've had it. I truly don't want to graduate college a lonely and single virgin when it seems the consensus is that it gets harder to find someone after uni. I'm already halfway through college. And nothing. 

I feel trapped, isolated, and I feel like no matter how much I try to work on myself, or fix my body or change my mindset, it will NEVER be enough. I'm relatively sheltered, I haven't achieved much like most of the people my age, I'm not living my best life, I've never had a job, I don't know how to drive, I've never been drunk... and people keep telling me confidence comes from experience... ***something I don't fucking have.*** 

The only comforts I have is my digital art and my storytelling. That's it. There's nothing else going for me and nobody gives a shit about me. So why should I give a shit about anyone else? Might as well find some rope and be done with it, because I don't think I can do this anymore.

I was happy growing up. I had friends and a family who loved me, and I was normal. Sure I had anxiety and depression, but I always thought things could and would get better. It makes me sad that the version of me at age 10, 15, 20 etc. never thought it would come to this. I always thought that there was some hope and help that I could cling onto.

But that’s not reality. Realistically most things don’t actually get better. Sure a few things may lighten up, but that feeling never lasts long. 

I guess in the end it’s up to the individual to decide if there’s enough good stuff in his/her life to balance out the bad stuff. I’m sure a better person would choose to focus on the good stuff and live his/her life optimistically. But that’s just not me.

SuicideWatch,"Yup it's me again, still thinking about dying. According to my parents, i was always a relatively happy child. But after the age of 11 or so, i started noticing something about my emotions. They are all just... off. And really hard to describe. Happiness is just... brief and almost unpleasant. Anger feels like an impulse to do something. Sadness is just like wanting to cry. But recently, i cannot seem to even get those reduced feelings. Everything that made me happy doesn't anymore. I've also tried new things, but those also dont make me feel any happiness. And i cannot reiterate how much i HATE. THIS. I just don't enjoy anything again. It's suffering. Just. Plain. Suffering. Torture even. The only thing i sort of enjoy is sleeping. And even that is getting old. I just don't want to do anything anymore. If anything, doing those old hobbies only serve as a distraction from the suffering. I just don't know what to do anymore. Also, sorry if this was hard to understand.

I've been to countless doctors and therapists etc at my family's request. My family keeps telling me they're worried about me, that I will do something really stupid. My cousin died some months ago to suicide, and seeing how it affected his family and even mine really ruined me. I don't think I'm directly suicidal anymore, but now I see no possible escape.

I'm tired of making my family worried. I'm tired of my sister, mom, and dad, asking me to please eat. My sister almost broke down crying the other day talking to me about how she was afraid I might attempt suicide. My mother has hinted at the same multiple times. 

I didn't use to have problems sleeping but now I spend 3 hours in bed slowly going mad until I can sleep. I have a ton of trouble eating too, which seems to be getting worse by the day, it's hard to explain but it just feels like my body doesn't want to eat, even if I'm starving. Feels as though I'm tired of food. I can't even bring myself to brush my teeth. I hate that my parents have to do so much for me because I can't bring myself to do it. Making toast is too much of a bother. I don't know what to do about it. I've been to so many different people for help, doctors and psychologists and people that think they can massage or hypnotize my mental health back because my mom keeps asking me to. 

Corona has pretty much saved me because anytime I'm at an exam I break down and puke, so luckily they have been cancelled this year. Still though, just presenting over teams or zoom to other students in my class brings me nausea for hours leading up to it, only getting worse and worse until it is finally done. Sometimes it feels like I get stressed and anxious over just going to the store to buy something if I haven't in a while. Started shaking and feeling nauseous the other day over going to a corona test. I'm not even scared of corona or the test itself in any way shape or form.

I am turning 27 in June, and I always believed that I would be a member of the 27 Club. I see no other alternatives, I can't imagine my life going anywhere else. If I look to the future all I see is the abrupt self-inflicted end to a timeline that only spans 27 years. 

I keep saying to myself that this is it. I know that this is how it's meant to be. I'm not a musician or an actor or an artist, I haven't made a name for myself. I have to kill myself at 27. There is nothing afterwards. It won't carry on, it only lasts 27 years. 

It's getting closer all the time and I can't imagine anyone will take me seriously, but I'm burning from the core and I'm going to go out. 27 is the end. I tattooed 27 tally marks on my wrist, right over the radial artery. It was decided for me, before I even existed.

SuicideWatch,"Please remember this is a dream. I’m going to tell it as well as I can remember it before it escapes my mind. The dream had a few “scenes” with no real transitions in between, just flashes. I remember quick images of other things happening from the dream, but I don’t know when they would have happened.

It starts in some old-feeling library. I can’t imagine where this place actually is bc I don’t recognize this at all. Well I was sitting in there, sobbing, begging my boyfriend to stay. He didn’t care. His mom ended up there too, and more in the “background” were his stepdad and two brothers. They just kinda showed up eventually because they weren’t there in the beginning, but they didn’t really care either. It felt like I was screaming and crying and begging to a wall. I ended up having a nervous tantrum and throwing a chair around, breaking it. They still hardly seemed to notice. I grabbed my boyfriend, hugged him, screaming/crying and ran off. He still barley seemed to notice. 

The next thing I know is I was in an overgrown playground with weeds almost as tall as me. My head was spinning. I was looking around, trying to find something to kill myself with. There was nothing I could really jump from, no rivers to drown myself in. Across a fence I noticed two people sneaking around and one of them had a gun. I climbed over the fence and started running at them, full force, yelling “shoot me.” The one who had the gun got spooked and shot me twice in the neck. The second that happened they disappeared, and I was looking up at the tall weeds as everything faded to black. For a moment, the world faded back in to show me some people I didn’t recognize, looking down at me, murmuring, and everything faded to black again. 

In between that last fade to black, and waking up, I felt at peace. When I woke up, I felt disoriented, and I felt something stuck in my throat. I thought it really happened for a second, and now I’m waking up in my bedroom. It took me a second to realize it was just a dream, and when I did, my heart sunk. I finally managed to get myself to wind up dead and it wasn’t even real. Im crying. It felt so real, and then it felt so peaceful.",I had a dream in which I killed myself.

SuicideWatch,"I fucking hate everything. And yes, I also fucking hate myself for that.

My life is bullshit just as I am.

19 y/o, born and raised in the shithole named ""Belarus"" (fucking gutter west of Russia and east of Poland. I don't know if this correct, but fuck if I care). I doubt any of you know about it, but who gives a shit.

I don't give a fuck about my family. My father &amp; mother were always bickering back and forth like lil bitches. In fact, I'm just a product of unintentional pregnancy or whatever the fuck y'all call it. My father is an alcoholic piece of shit, a cheater, a barbarian, who destroyed the meaniing of the family in this very cell of society. I was fucked in this life and he was drunk. I got pushed out of my mother's vagina into this life and guess what? This fucknut was high again!

Despite how much he fucked up or how much he cheated, my moms always forgave him. He punched her, he slurred at her, talked shit to her, threated her with moving her outta their place. I had to protect her several time, in one of our encounters I even almost fucking killed him (no bullshit here). Yet again, guess what? In the end they divorced, but now they reunited on good note and acting all happy-hippy-yay and all that shit. Fuck them both.

They used to beat me, slurr at me (which they still do), expecting to me act mature in my 11 years and shit. Yet, they didn't give about me fuck at all. No asking how my days go, what I like and what I don't, what I strive to be, etc, etc, etc. I was neglected, idk, maybe I just feel so. My mom had a burden to carry our family, but I still hate them both.

I also have a sister, but I'm not tight with her. There's like 10 years gap between us. I had many fallouts with her too. Anyways, point is - I'm not close with her nor I wish to be close with her anymore. I tried to close this gap, but it didn't work. Anyway, fuck her too.

I'm not sure if I sucked at school. I guess I had potential, but I just didn't gave a shit just as my family. I just kept flowing with stream. My grades was good, but not great or best. Had potential with math, physics, chemistry, yet I blew it. Graduated a year ago, failed at entering all public universities with scholarship, so I went to a private one. Busted some balls with it, spent a fine sum of money on it, and now I dropping out. It's just ain't no me.

I betrayed my first true best friend, when I became a bully. Was picking with others on weak, and my friend happened to be 'weak'. I broke his finger at the end of 5th grade and he has left the school. I tried to reconnect with him, but he rightfully rejected me and told me to fuck off. I've deserved it all the way.

From 2014 shit started to took off. Depression, nihilism, loneliness and all that shit. Ended up spending most of my teen years playing v-games and shit.

I wanted to go to US since I was little shit. I even built a plan for myself year: earn about 5 gs and get I-20 for cheap-ass university in San-Diego. Now it seems like oblivion. I also applied for DV-2021, but my chances of winning it second to none.

All I have evee strived to be is either being professional wrestler, an actor, musician, screenwriter, film director, or just writer. Nothing out of it is working out for me nor it will.

2020 hit and I dumped all people I used to hang out with. Stole a girlfriend from some asshole, but ended up dumpling her. Not because she's bad, it's just me being piece of horseshit. She was really supportive, but I guessed she couldn't bear my depressed-ass no more, despite hee being depressed as well, so I cut her outta my life to not make her life any more shitter. She was still with her abusive fucker, she was on her way dumping him, but she took her time and they still together. The reason I dumped her was to not bring her down amymore (she complained about it) and because I felt like she was just bullshiting me and playing on both side. Now I'm ghosting her, but from time to time I stalk on her. About a week ago she started to make fun of me being suicidal and she running with this shit with her friends.

Sometimes I just want to grab a fucking knife or pitchfork and stab and slash all of them to death. I started feeling that way recently.

I tried to kill myself about seven to nine times, yet all this attempts was unsuccessful as you can see. Tried to hang myself with a shirt a month ago, but I failed. Twice.

Anyways, I'm a fucking piece of shit. I have no love for my family, no love my friends, nothing to strive for anymore and shit, shit and shit. Yadayaydayada.

Recently I've moved out from my parents, so now I'm also homeless. I'm thinking about getting employed and rent a room for myself, live an adult life and shit, but this seems to be a stupid idea since I'm going to kill myself in two or three weeks.

I have no desire fix anything or getting better at anything. I've lost all the passion toward life and my hobbies

 I slashed my wrist, my palm and arm are burned with cigarettes, I tried to hang myself, I tried to overdose on pills, I tried to fall out of my fucking window. All to no prevail.

I'm just getting high of liquor now and plotting my death. I'm gonna drink 40 grams of poppers, mix it with booze and die from whatever the fuck I'll end up dying from. If it won't work, I force myself to make a fucking slipknot and end this bitch.

I also found in the same notebook, a lot of detailed sketches examples include a skull breaking apart at the top with the brain coming out, and a heart this is hanging in this room with a single light over it, the heart is falling part and the bones under neath are exposed in the parts that have broke off.

Day by day it gets harder, as my sleep gets worse &amp; worse so is my sanity, in this empty room thoughts I had once thought were impossible fill my head keeping me up for hours. The depression, anxiety and emotional trauma, its the only thing I know anymore its starting to become too much on top of the stressful life I have full of health issues. I try to find ways to cope some better than others in fact this is a new one im trying, writing down my thoughts and feelings down as I don't like to be a burden to the few friends I have left.

Everyday I wake up &amp; look at the guns hanging on my walls and say not today, but what happens when I decide to today is the day. Ive let my emotions &amp; feelings drive away the ones I love most, ive been spoiled by having a very tight nit group of friends, but what happens when you have felt like you put too much stress on them with your seemingly pointless problems, you start driving them away because you plan on that fateful day coming soon as your mental status deteriorates, as much as it hurts oh so bad you don't want to hurt anyone so you push, push,push until SNAP! They break because they think you don't want them anymore but in reality you don't want to hurt them. So now I sit here alone in my room as all the thoughts once again fill my head, any sleep I do get tonight will be ruined by the night mares of something happening to the ones that I love or them crying at my funeral because as much as I tried not too I still managed to fuck up and hurt them, but would they really care if I died tomorrow, this is a cry for help no one will ever see until its too late.

SuicideWatch,"I am so desperate for answers and support right now. The pain all started about 3 weeks ago, but let me give backstory first. I was born with Hypospadias (and OCD but I’ll explain that part later), which pretty much means my urthea was on the underside of the tip instead of the top. I had surgery when I was 6 months old, which consisted of closing up the old hole, and created a new one with working tubes and everything. The surgery went smoothly. Recently, I learned from my father that the only reason they agreed with having surgery was because of complications with urinating, which could have lead to something fatal. In the end though, I was told nothing in the slightest went wrong during surgery. There was a point in my youth were I was afraid to masturbate, the slightest graze of my penis making me paranoid (This eventually subsided). During this period, I got an infection/irritation in the meatus which doctors presumed was from bacteria/germs in summer camp swimming pools, plus a painful rubbing of swimsuit netting. And here’s where the OCD makes its way into the story. At this stage in my life, I didn’t even know what OCD was, but nevertheless I had it. This irritation I had caused me a lot pain and distress, and my young OCD mind kept producing negative and repetitive thoughts on the matter. This no doubt in my mind made the pain feel worse, especially since I was so young and didn’t know how to control the intrusive thoughts. I went to a handful of doctors and urologist, and all of them said my penis was in perfect condition, and it was just a little irritation. The pain got so bad that the doctor who originally did my Hypospadias surgery was gonna preform a cystoscopy, which is pretty much a look inside my penis. I was thrilled that I was going to get an answer for this pain. After the procedure, I was hit with “everything is fine”. I went home not very happy with my response because I wanted to know the cause of the pain. The aftermath of the cystoscopy was very traumatizing due to the spasms/passing of air the penis does from whatever the hell they did down there. It hurt worse than before, and I didn’t even touch a swimming pool for the rest of the summer. Eventually, the pain must have gone away, and I didn’t think about it until recently. It all started the day after I stopped my Luvox (a medicine for anxiety and OCD). I was feeling in a very comfortable state to stop my medicine, so I didn’t expect anything worse than a little case of the shakes/anxiety for a time being. That day, after masturbating, I went to pee like always, and I was met with a awful pain while peeing and it worsened after. My parents told me it was because I was off my medicine but I didn’t think so. A week went by and no pain, until an entire week passed and I was in pain again from peeing after masturbating. Every since then, the pain is stayed and I feel no hope of it getting any better. It’s a constant burning sensation, mixed with a feeling of constant pee in my urethra. I make sure to pee as much as I can, but I always a feel the urge to pee. The more I hold in my pee, the worse the pain gets. I also keep getting random pains in my testicles. I’m at wits ends right now. The pain is getting worse by the day. I had to go to the emergency room one night due to the pain. They gave me medicine as if they were treating me for Urethritis (which I thought was the case until I was told I didn’t have any inflammatory cells in my urine), and some pain medicine. They did an X-ray of my stomach, and another ultrasound of my testicles. Ultrasound showed no problems. The X-ray showed that there was stool (poop) in my stomach l, which pretty much meant I was constipated, which I sorta was. They gave me Miralax or something for that. I went home that night still in pain. The next day I went to a urologist, and they gave me bullshit answers that everything was fine and it’ll go away. I’m fearing for my life because if this pain continues, I’m not sure how much longer I can take. It’s incredibly excruciating, and is preventing me from enjoying life. Whether it’s phone calls or hanging out with friends, or even working out, I’m meet with this pain. It’s so annoying because I have this horrible pain and all the doctors say I’m fine. My parents think it’s the medicine, but I think it’s more on the psychical side. I’m in desperate need of some answers.

\\\\\\Third is the lack of communication that is killing our relationship (from my side ofcourse, gotta thank the social anxiety) 
\\\\\\\Fourth is,i pretty much have given up on life,its only a matter of time before i off myself or do something stupid (don't share this with anyone)
\\\\\\\Fifth is no matter how much you tell me that i'm no burden,i still feel that i am, you are a great girl ,you funny, kind talented...etc and im only bringing you down,after you managed to fix your life,im trully proud of you for being so strong.""

I took all the pills in my house (ibuprofen - almost a full bottle, off-brand Zyrtec - maybe 5 at most, and then a months worth of my antidepressants). I laid in bed with my dogs, closed my eyes and waited for fate to take its course.

I then realized, I was having a bad day... not a bad life. Around 10 minutes later, I went to the bathroom and puked up the entire contents of my stomach. Went back to bed. Woke up with a terrible hangover. Slept for the majority of the day.

For the past 24 hours, all I've wanted to do is sleep. There is a pressure in my head - almost like what I felt with my past concussion. Is this a side effect of the pills I tried to take? Am I going to go brain dead? I thought I puked out all of the pills, and now I feel this pressure and I am starting to freak out.

I am terrified of going to the hospital. I am a teacher, and I need to finish the school year out and do everything on my end of the school year checklist. I am afraid that if I go to get my head checked out,they are going to want to keep me for a few days to be monitored for suicide watch. Will I be okay?

In March, I accidentily overdosed on meth and xanax sending me into a state of suicidal psychosis and screaming threats of self harm. These were purely drug related. I was admitted to a mental hospital and spent two days there while i detoxed. I have never felt popular. Ive never been to a party. I have a small circle of friends at my boarding school. Me and said friends are avid weed smokers and occassional psychedelic users and very aware of the dangers. Recently however, as Ive been home during quarentine, my girlfriend who had been with me through shoplifting alcohol and my overdose, broke up with me very suddnely and explained ho much of a shitty boyfriend I was. She has tried to convince me it isnt my fault entirely, but I dont believe her. I feel like a complete freak to anyone at my school and fear if they find out about my overdose I will be socially exiled.

SuicideWatch,"Okay. This might be a little long. 
So since I was 14 I’ve been suicidal. There’s been abusive moms, friends, and partners. There’s been a long history of self harm and hospitalizations (6 to be exact). There’s been dysphoria and internalized homophobia. But I’m 18 now, enrolled to go to my dream college in the fall with a $30,000 a year scholarship. But I still think that any day I might kill myself. 

On January 6th, after a community tragedy, I stole my dad’s car and drove it off the road into a ravine at 70 mph. I broke my neck, wrist, and ankle and collapsed my aorta (I have a stent and hella metal in my arm and leg now), but somehow I survived with just a few ugly surgery scars. I was in the icu for 2 weeks and an inpatient for 2 months, but got out due to a legal loophole. But recently I’ve felt terrible pain whenever I walk on my bad ankle. And I have to look at my numerous scars every day. 

So all of this in addition to the fact I’m going to be living alone 200+ miles from home in less than a week has made me think about suicide a lot. There’s no one to find me once I’m up there. What’s stopping me? I have a therapist and I am a client with the Department of Mental Health (DMH) but I can’t seem to reach out to any of my 4 providers, and after my last suicide attempt my dad told me thinking about it gave him depression, so that’s a dead end.

SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account. I’m a 21F university student. School and success have always been very important to me growing up in the UK, neither of my parents went to university and I was going to be the first. All my life I just wanted to be successful, and after I turned 16 this is where it all started to fall apart.

I did very well in my exams at 16. I got 10 A*s and 2 As, and it remains my most proud achievement. I won’t go into a long spiel but basically I was discouraged from dropping a subject at my exams at 18, to get into university, by my school. I was barely passing and I didn’t need the subject but my school would not let me take 4 subjects instead of 3, despite the whole country mostly taking 3. I had got an offer to Cambridge University and I failed it due to my bad grades. This is when I started being suicidal and when I guess my depression started. 

I took a year out and reapplied and got another offer to study at Cambridge. It was expensive for my parents to take a gap year but they wanted me to try again. I worked so so hard, but I panicked again due to the pressure in one of my exams and I barely missed my offer by a handful of marks. I ended up doing my backup subject and another pretty good university in the UK, but it was not my dream university.

I struggled in my first year of university and had to resit one subject in my final exams to pass the year. I was not helped by the university in any way when I came back for second year, where I am now, and felt like I couldn’t change my subject.

I’m now hours away from sitting my first final exam which actually counts for my degree and I just want to die. So so much.

I struggled this year academically also and got very little support. I barely revised and it is all my fault, I don’t know what’s fucking wrong with me I don’t know how I just never worked hard enough to study. I have barely done any work and I’m such a failure. I have no motivation or drive to do these exams now. There is an option to sit in September but if I fail I’m out of the university. If I do them now I can potentially resit in September. I don’t want to do any of this any more, I just want to die and never have to think about my education, my degree, my job, my success and my future ever again.

I don’t know what to do. I’m religious and have no idea how I could even kill myself. I live with 5 other family members including my grandparents. I am too coward, as always hah, to kill myself. But years ago I knew I would never EVER consider suicide. And look where we are now.

SuicideWatch,"**Disclaimer:** *This post has to due with sexual themes, so if this could possibly be a trigger for you, please do scroll passed. Thank you.*

Before I start, let me preface something; I'm one-hundred and ten percent a virgin. Don't assume for a second that I'm some Chad complaining that I get too much sex or something. I've never even hugged or dated a girl before, let alone have sexual relations with one. That being said, I'll start. 

I hate sex and being sexually driven. I'm seventeen, so my hormones are constantly skull-fucking me, no pun intended. I get aroused many times throughout the day and it happens easier than I'd like to admit. When I get that way I often make stupid decisions, or I'll talk to a person in the hopes of sexual gain whether I'm aware of it or not. I'll watch excessive amounts of pornography just to help get it over with so I can move on with my day. Does it keep me from doing things? No, I can live without masturbating, but it's so, so fucking annoying to be aroused when I'm trying to just go about my day.

You may ask ""Why do you hate it so much? It's one of the few pleasures people like us have."" or something like that. Well, quite frankly, I find that statement to be ignorant. I'd rather go my whole life being a virgin if it meant I could maintain what little innocence I have left in my being. To be able to pursue a relationship without having to question whether I only like them because I want to have sex with them or if it's because I truly love them. To be able to take things lightly and not always assume that the things people say are euphemisms and shit like that. I want to be able to look at a girl and think ""Wow, she seems nice."" or ""Wow, I really enjoy her outfit."" rather than ""Man, the things I'd do to her."" or ""Man, she is *way* out of my league."" It can be really, really fucking debilitating. I hate when I'm in public or with a female acquaintance and my eyes trail off to parts of her body as if they were fucking magnetic. I hate it, I hate it, I *hate* it.

I know being as young as I am may be a deterrent for most of the people on here. ""Oh, you're too young and juvenile to understand."" Fuck you. I don't care how young I am, I've seen and experienced more than I should have at this age, so I feel as though I don't deserve to be baby talked. Am I juvenile and ignorant in ways? Yes. But, for the most part, my eyes have been opened. And I can say, with every shred of confidence I can muster in my being, I fucking hate sex.

In the last three years I have been diagnosed with OCD Aspergers and ADHD my dad has cheated on my mum and left leaving us with little money. And I’m in a pit of depression. Tried to OD last year too and can’t get to school due to my anxiety and panic attacks (I’m 16m)

Every time I walk home I pass a bridge. I constantly have intrusive thoughts about ending it there (they have lessened since I watched the bojack episode halfway down, but it’s still there) 

All I want is happiness that lasts. Only thing keeping me here is my mum and how she would be destroyed by my passing and my art 

So my question is do the thoughts eventually go away? Or do I have to do something that I might regret.

I don’t feel as if I add to this world or that I ever will. I’m not smart, I’m not good at anything, I don’t have any hobbies, I’m a very quiet, boring and shy girl. I’m full of anxiety and it affects my everyday life to the point where I can’t experience or do things most people do. I’m very depressed, I’m tired all the time and I have no energy. My family situation isn’t the best. My dad has been emotionally absent all my life and recently he’s been physically absent. I really only see him during Christmas for two hours tops. I have daddy issues and low self esteem because of my father. I still have feelings for my teacher from a year ago and can’t seem to get rid of them. He was everything I wanted in a father. It hurts and I can’t stop thinking about him. My mother is bipolar and is a ticking time bomb. She stresses me out so much and gives me anxiety. I can feel the negative energy around her when she’s in her mood. I have three siblings and none of us are close, although maybe one of my brothers I’m kinda close with. The other two make no effort to do things with me and don’t know anything about me. I feel like all I have is my mom, the only family member that I have a true relationship with. She is all I have and is a good mom when she’s not in an episode, but it’s a hit or miss everyday. Living with her is so stressful. I don’t have any close friends. I have a best friend, but she’s a horrible friend. She’s very selfish and all about her likings. I have other friends, but they’re more like peers. I really only Snapchat them, but don’t talk and actually know them personally. I just finished my first semester of college and I met this girl and guy from my English. The girl became my friend and we really liked the guy. We both ended up becoming friends with him and in the beginning he was flirting with me. He told me that he missed me (this is during quarantine and school had been shut down at this point) and that he had a lot of fun with me in the last day of class. He asked to hang out with me a few times after quarantine was over. He even invited me to join him in a costume party for Halloween with his siblings. Halloween is far away, but I thought that showed how much he was interested in me. As the days went by, my friend was trying to get at him and eventually he asked her on a date. I’m crushed and hurt to the fact that he was flirting with me and then picks my friend. I hate both of them right now. It’s the fact that he flirted with me in the beginning. I’m never the first pick. I feel as if I will never have a relationship. I cannot handle my emotions positively and I can’t communicate. I have never been taught how to do these things in a healthy way. I have anger issues and take it out on those around me. When it’s over, I feel extremely guilty. I would say I have a nice body, but an ugly face. I have no eyebrows, a gap between my teeth and shitty hair. I also have scars from piercings. I feel ugly everyday. I am so shy and quiet that I cannot act like myself around people. I have no personality at this point. No guy will ever be interested in me. What makes me happy is kids. I love being around kids. I love to love kids and give them affection. I want to protect them and keep them safe. I want kids of my own and feel that’s my only purpose, but then I feel I’ll be a horrible mom. I need to help myself first. I’ve gone to therapy, but it never helped. I’ve tried an antidepressant, but I’m horrible at taking it. I also like to drink and smoke and I know you can’t do that when you’re on them. All I want to do is drink and smoke. Weed makes me laugh and I love to laugh.

SuicideWatch,"I have posted this as a comment and would like to reinstate this in a post.  Please look at your desire to live closely. Its very likely infinite and futile. Futility of your desires depresses you but the often ignored infinite aspect of it is what drives us through the worst and the best of the days.  More money, more plans/family for immortalising your being after your death, more people to acquaint and stuff to learn about.  Neither your worst nightmare nor your *lifelong* dream would fulfil or diminish this. You will wake up the next day wanting more, no matter how long.

I am not saying suicidal feelings are a lie.  I know you've been hurt tremendously or you feel you've hurt tremondously. But if you could come to acceptance with the infinite aspect of your desires. Out of sheer vigilance. A vigilance in vanity.  Like you have just born and you just see/sense stuff like a newborn baby.  You have successfully upgraded yourself from suicidal to depressed, in the least.  

There is a haven between your grief/rage and outright despair/refusal to listen to your calling to live.  A coward, an asshole, a depressed or even an insane being isn't a dead person because it can be a ""f\*\*k the world"" than just ""f\*\*k me"".  Let the world show a sign of apology and correction.  Let it show a sign that your desires are still sought and could be fulfilled to some extent over and over again.  Let it show the real culprits who have fouled your being into guilt.  You came in this world without bias for anything and you deserve to go off without one.

SuicideWatch,"For as long as I can remember, I've been mentally, verbally, and occasionally physically abused by my mother. I never really saw it as anything different from other parents, because I didn't know better. Eventually I found out that what she was doing just wasn't ok, and I decided to tell people. First I told a few friends, but they told the teachers, and shit happened and no one believed me and all that ended up happening was I got even more suicidal, and my mom got even more angry. This happened again, and again, until eventually I stopped telling people because I figured first, that they didn't care, and second, that all they'd do is tell more adults who would make my mom angrier.

Sometimes are worse than others and the past couple weeks have possibly been some of the worst, not sure why. I have nobody in my life who GENUINELY cares for me for who I am. The only love and support I have is entirely conditional, and in order for me to receive it, I have to act a certain way, look a certain way, be a certain way... and it’s really tiring. If I make the slightest mistake or get grumpy or upset or my fun smorgasbord of mental illnesses causes me to become irritable, my mother completely turns on me and starts treating me like shit.

I can’t foresee myself having any sort of future at all. The only dream I’ve ever had is the dream to be a singer but realistically I know I’m not good enough to actually achieve that.

SuicideWatch,"I love my friends and I feel lucky to have them

But their religious views make me feel so disrespected

They believe suicide is a sign of weakness and takes away the most precious gift given by god. They think mental illness is a choice. 

It makes me feel so invalidated. They are telling me that my struggles are a choice and my depression is a personality flaw. 

For most issues e.g. abortion or gay marriage, I can disagree with them and move on. I don't want religion to stand in the way of my friendships. 

But my mental health is so personal and sensitive to me, I feel personally offended and humiliated when they believe these things. Even if they don't say it to my face, just knowing that they believe that I am responsible for my pain, hurts. 

Most days I just live my life and I'm pretty happy. But I feel like I'm carrying around this heavy weight.

SuicideWatch,"I found out my boyfriend who commit suicide sent my nudes around to multiple girls in an attempt to flirt with them while we were together. Getting off to the fact he was cheating on me. He’s also done a lot of much worse things to me, which I won’t disclose. I just always blamed it on his life circumstances and him ‘not knowing any better’ but I’m mortified. He got outed for doing illegal things with a minor, that being me. I don’t know how to feel. I feel angry, like I should hate him, but a part of me just can’t. I just don’t know why anyone would do that to me. He watched my ex do it to me and me almost kill myself over it, then he did the same thing and just said I’d be so pissed if I found out. The same day he leaked my nudes he sent me a massive paragraph telling me how much he loved me. I feel grossed out. I also managed to not get into college because of the fact the final year of high school I spent focused on him, going through multiple break downs, and focusing on that rather than my studies. 

Yet I still feel emotionally drawn to him, almost like stockholm syndrome. I don’t know if that’s because he’s passed away, or if I’d still feel the same way if he was here. He needed help, serious help, but it just doesn’t feel real. I don’t know how to handle anything. Everything feels like it’s falling to pieces. I feel bad for feeling this way about him because his family are so nice, and they’re going through a lot. I just want to disappear. There’s probably more people who received those photos.

It's fucked up. I'm fucked up. I broke down in my bedroom as soon as the clock struck midnight when I realized that I was ""celebrating"" my birthday in isolation. I don't live with anyone else, I'm far away from family and friends, and I clearly still haven't healed from losing my dad last year. I meant to intentionally avoid the surprise my friends set up for me when I realized they were up to something, but I guess I no longer had to think of a lame excuse when an anxiety attack just swooped in right then and there.

I can't accept the good things that come to me because I suddenly feel like I'm a fraud. I feel like I've put up a front so well for so long that people can't separate the ""good"" from ""me"" when really, I'm worthless. I'm not actually worth jack shit. I'm dead weight without any direction in life. 

I hate how one moment I think I'm doing fine and suddenly I'm hit by these episodes of pain and self-loathing and I begin to lose interest in everything. I push people away because I don't want to tell them about my thoughts and feelings because deep inside I feel like I always talk too much or scare them off when I let my real shit out.

I'm fucking up my relationships with people. Not just friends even. The one time I begin to actually get somewhere with a potential significant other I go spiraling all the way down and I can just feel them losing interest in staying with me—and we're not even together yet.

I nearly killed myself when I found out that I had to stay a year back during my degree. I had no friends, and I had no motivation or any interest in I guess anything except gaming and music.I'm always glued to my phone looking at youtubers playing all those latest games which I couldn't play. I had no friends to talk to and talking to your parents about your problems will make them worry more than they already are. I got used to this lifestyle of mine and it didn't bother me, at least for while Somehow I managed to complete my degree and took another year to study for entrance exams. I did all these for my parents. They knew about it and what my interests were, but in this world you gotta find some job to sustain yourself. So gaming wasn't really a job, its like a saying in my country. And you can't really argue with parents. And at that time I was in cloud9 I guess that I somehow I got into a university ( I had no hopes in getting selected, I was already mentally prepared that I will be staying home and searching for a job).

So fastforward I'm living in Europe on my own for my Master's and it's been nearly a year with bad grades on my assignments and my exams. And I tried to talk to student council and some people in my class about it, but they just kind of said hang in there. I thought people closest to me would understand but I guess nobody does.

I’ve been drowning in agonizing pain ever since I can remember. I’ve always tried to hold on and look ahead and it’s never been worth it. How can I trust that it will get better?? 

I hate every single part of myself with every ounce of my being. It feels like everything about myself isn’t right. Like this body or life wasn’t meant for me. like the person I am now isn’t supposed to me be. It isn’t me. I’m trapped in a body and in a life that isn’t mine. It hurts so bad. I’ve always hated myself. I remember asking my mom when I was little what I would look like when I grew up because I didn’t want to look like me.

I hate my height so much. I constantly stress over it. I wish I was short like 5’0 tall. I can’t stand up without wanting to cry or hurt myself. I have this desire to feel protected and small because It makes me feel safe. Something I don’t have much experience feeling. 

I hate my face, my body, my personality.. etc.. 
Every time I’m around people I analyze everything I did wrong and I feel Shit. So I just don’t anymore. And even when I did it was a one in a while kind of thing. 
(Sorry is that doesn’t make much sense) 

Every night I’ve been praying to god that I don’t have to wake up the next day. That by some miracle I wouldn’t have to exist in this world anymore. 
I hate the way the sun shines through my window in the morning. I hate the beating of my chest. I hate the little things that remind me that I’m alive. That I’m me. 

I have tried committing die once before and I didn’t do it right, Which is why I’m still here unfortunately. I would try again and I want to but it’s so much work. And what do I do if it doesn’t work again? Go through so much more shit that I don’t even want to think about. Medicine, hospitalization, treatment centers, more therapy, more medicine. I’ve tried 14 medications over the past year and a half/2 years and none of them have worked. 
I just wish I never existed. That I never had the chance to be alive so that I didn’t have to experience the pain of being me. 

I told my mom that I hate her for having me. For making me exist. I feel bad but it’s true. I’m so mad at her and my father. Being alive is incredibly demanding and exhausting. 
Every single morning I wake up I want to cry because it’s another reminder that I have to continue on as me. And I hate being me. I hate it so fucking much. My life is excruciatingly grueling. Every day is a nightmare. It’s been like this since childhood. Ever since I can remember. 

I’ve never had true friends. no one wanted to be my friend even when I was little. in preschool all of the girls would hide from me in the morning and try to not be around me. i cried when my mom dropped me off because I hated it there. I remember running out to the car when my mom was about to leave and crying hysterically. Then in kindergarten the only person I thought was my friend didn’t want to play with me. I never played with anyone. Then two people who I thought were my friends would say ‘let’s pretend we don’t know you’ and then ignore me for a long time. I had a diary when I was little like elementary school and wrote about how much I was lonely and sad. 
I was taken out of school in middle school for because I was so depressed and lonely. I was invisible. Summary after that: I then joined a new school in 8th grade and stayed until 9th grade. I was then taken out again because of my depression a plan for a suicide attempt. I was homeschooling on and off but now am working on my GED. 

I started cutting when I was 11 and that was the only thing I felt like I had control over in my life. 
I’ve been clean for a few months but fuck it’s so hard. 

I’ve cut myself off from everyone except for my parents, my sister, and my therapist. I have no contact with anyone else. I figure it’s best so that people don’t have to deal with me anymore. I just want to disappear. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to do anything anymore. life is so exhausting.

I’ve been in therapy for about 8-9 years now, I’ve been using drugs for over 10, and I’ve been through a handful of medications to help with my consistently unstable mental health state; Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, Seroquel, Paxil, Lamictal, etc but I’ve never been sober really :/ I had 1 brief stint of sobriety starting 10/11/19 and it lasted 69 days- 61 of which where spent in treatment so like really only a week in the world, and most of that was spent locked up In my room, hiding. I’m aware that I’m manic, I’ve got a severe depressive anxiety disorder, pretty bad PTSD, just got diagnosed bipolar 1 I believe, yadda yadda yadda

I’m only 18 I feel like this isn’t old enough to be spending your winter and summer breaks burying your friends but I just lost 2 dozen people THIS MONTH ALONE, all overdosed with 1 exception; a heart attack. 

I’m no longer on the streets and I’ve got a roof over my head, I have access to food, running water, functional electric power, I have A BED- like a REAL MATTRESS with PILLOWS and SHEETS today like holy shit that’s insane to even SAY. Not long ago my forearm was the best pillow around and my backpack was my blanket, and anything was a bed- so I understand I’m in MUCH MUCH MUCH better circumstances currently. 

I keep reaching out for help with substance abuse, (DOC’s have historically been Ketamine, 3-MeO-PCP, and Oxycodone, but most recently Fentanyl, AcetylFentanyl, and if that’s not available, ONLY then, Smack) but like I’m starting to wonder which issue do I tackle first?


I don’t wanna be alive to tell the truth. The only reason I’m trying so hard is I wanna start a family of my own. I wanna be a dad, I wanna be a husband. And I can’t exactly tell my S/O “hey babe so listen, the only reason I haven’t left you devastated via my untimely death is because I just really wanna connect family trees and create life with you” or else like THE FUCK- THAT SOUNDS AWFUL to tell a person. 

But it’s the truth like this isnt for me. I’m not doing any of it for me. I DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE, but I wanna WANT to be here, you know? Im so conflicted and I feel so lost and confused. 

Since I was 11 ive tried desperately numerous times to take my life; hanging+handful of Vicodin going into 6th grade, leading to a hospitalization, another Vicodin overdose at 14 leading to hospitalization and then rehab, DXM and Xanax overdose 9th grade, still 14. End of 9th grade year, 15 now, alcohol + GHB + Alprazolam, 10th grade year DXM + DPH, 11th grade year there were a few- another DXM + DPH attempt that actually requires me to get recessitated and yet another hospitalization followed that then another rehab, then an oxy overdose while driving on the freeway which caused a horrible horrible accident, I had 8 total in the car and we hit the median and flipped and they still forgave me, then August of 2019 I tried like 5 times in a week with anything I could find in my grandmothers WALK-IN MEDICINE CLOSET/CABINET, and then got kicked to the streets where I overdosed on heroin trying it for the second time, and then begged to go to rehab- came back- did fairly well, then accidentally overdosed on GHB at school, then another accidental DXM overdose, and then finally March 18th at like 1am I overdosed on a bad batch of what I thought was Fentanyl or AcetylFet and had to get narcanned 3 or 4 rounds....

After everything I’ve tried dude, drug overdoses, hanging, slashing/stabbing main arteries, like SOMETHING up there won’t accept me just yet. Idk who the fuck is keeping me down here but someone or something is and I’m honestly not too happy with it. 

I wanna get sober, I want to WANT to live. 

Does my doubt overshadow my will power? Possibly...I have no clue what’s going on in my head. I thought I was more self aware but like my reactions to anything and everything are so out of proportion on either end of the spectrum, high n low, like something in my brain just isn’t right. Gears are turning but somethings stuck and shit isn’t working, yknow?

SuicideWatch,"I can’t take this anymore. I really can’t. I am so weak, everyone else can do it; why can’t I? This feels so weird, but the only place I can talk about this stuff is the internet. I’m a waste of everything. The world is already so overpopulated; what’s the point of me living? I’m not even living; I’m just alive. I wish I could go out and be happy. I wish that I could enjoy life. My parents were screaming at me about how I’m “living the best years of my life” and how I’m “wasting these precious monomers sitting inside” oh, let’s not forget the “when I was your age, I hung out with the other kids.” There are so many reasons why I *shouldn’t* be alive, I have a hard time clinging onto the good reasons that keep me here. I know that I could reach out and talk. I could go to a therapist. I was raised in a kind of “don’t share; don’t talk” family. Even the anonymous text therapy, I can’t even do *that*. I feel that the random therapist will hunt me down or some shit, I don’t know what I’m scared of. Trust issues, I guess; always keeping me back. Then again, “I’m keeping me back”; a random quote from some random teacher in the world. I don’t even know *why* I am like this. I don’t know why everything is getting worse. I can’t explain it. Maybe it’s all getting better and I’m not numb anymore; it’s been so long, I don’t know what emotions feel like. I don’t feel like it’s getting better, though. The suicidal thoughts are *way* to constant for me to be getting better. It’s all that I think of now. I’ll be looking out a window and I think “I could jump out. Should I jump out?” I always check myself.. but what if I stop? What if I ask myself the “suicide question” and I answer “yes” again? I mean, it’s not like anyone around me would be shocked. I don’t really know people anyway, I wouldn’t hurt anyone. My parents didn’t really do anything when I attempted. 

Does anyone else have that disc of self hatred? It replays a ton of insults all day. I’ll be self loathing and I think of an insult that I know I’m not.. but I tell myself it anyway. I am so worthless. People will easily respond “no! You’re worth it. Keep living!”.. Let me be honest, it doesn’t reach me. I read it and I continue with my suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I just need to rest. I can’t do that while I’m alive. I have insomnia, I take meds for it.. but it doesn’t allow me to have a restful sleep. If I don’t take my meds, I can’t sleep. If I take my meds, it’s terrible sleep. If I died, I don’t think it would have a strong impact on anyone. My parents don’t really care about me, they might be sad; nothing drastic. My suicidal [not close] friend might kill himself.. Maybe that’s why I’m living. I’m living so I can keep another person in this hell. I don’t want to be alive and I’m keeping him here. I can’t wait 80 years to die, if my natural life plays out. Why should I graduate and go to college? I’m probably going to kill myself. Why should I do things that impact the future?

SuicideWatch,"So here's what I did wrong.

I had a plan. I've been having one for months, years even. I wrote letters, texts put in drafts to send out at the last moment. I was supposed to be home alone for at least 5 hours. 

I researched a lot on how to do it. I was almost set on the night-night method because of how painless it claims to be. I even got the right materials. 

But every time I thought about it I backed out, it felt like I was actively violating myself. I thought no one would understand. 

It felt psychologically easier for me to deeply cut myself since I already cut, and take a whole bottle of Valium for good measure (I was already on it so I had easy access). It felt to me like no one would be surprised to find me bloodless in the shower since almost everyone knows I cut myself, it's as if they almost expect me to do something like that. 

My whole family was at a birthday party, which I didn't go to with the excuse that I needed to research something for a very important job I would have to do the following week. 

So first I took the Valium, which of course had the effect of numbing my emotions. All I felt was dizziness, dread, like I was already on my way out. I cut myself deeply, to the point where I had a ""fuck what have I done"" moment. But I believe Valium didn't make me see it clearly, since now I realize they were not deep enough. It would have seemed like an accident, even for me. 

And then my brother came home because he forgot his fucking allergy medication and was worried I was nowhere in the house. 

He found me and called 911 and from then on all I could feel is cold and I couldn't coordinate my movements. For a moment I thought ""cool, I'm finally dying"". 

I am now in hospital. Again. I sent those texts that were only meant to be sent if I wasn't around to face their consequences and now I can't face the people I love after what I told them.

He's one of my best friends and we have been talking and doing video calls a lot because we live far from each other, also because we're both in the same dnd group.

We are both not doing well and have hinted at these things a few times in the past. Lately he's been talking really negatively about himself. Usually we do so in a joking way but it's been getting worse. He takes a long time to answer my texts and he always seems distracted or far away when we video chat.

He had an episode where he wasn't online for days and I reached out to him and asked what was up. We talked a bit after but he's been very absent. That was one month ago.

He hasn't answered my text in nearly 2 weeks. He sent me a text essentially saying that something happened and that he needs time to think (he's struggling financially I hope it's because of that).

I know I'm probably over thinking and I don't want to be annoying and give him time to think but I'm really worried about him. He once told me (while drunk) that he tried to kill himself before. I can't stop thinking that he maybe tried and succeeded.",I'm really worried about my friend,t3_groqh5,1

What happened is that I decided to call my therapist before end it all and we talk for hours. Also talked with some of you guys and honestly never had this kind of support in life, for that I'm profoundly grateful.  Living with a narcissist mother can put all yours thoughts in hell, I just need to remember if I have any worth as a person. I'll let the pandemics end and move on. One thing my therapist say was to write  down what happened today so I don't get easily manipulated again in the future, and never come back to this mindset and place. 
Can thank you guys enough for the support. Hope no one ever get on this place in life.

Hello. I'm a woman  from  Brazil, I don't speak English fluently.
Here is a short resume from my life till now: my mother is narcissistic to the hell and genuinely hate me and thinks the whole world has something against or with 
her, if you know what a narcissistic mother is you know is bloody nightmares. I don't have a dad. She (And my grandmother) mistreated me all my life, one sentence I heard the most is: you're a burden. Ten years ago I suffered from intense self mutilation
, I just since then end all this bullshit. But life goes around... I tried my best. I did therapy, I get prescription for pills, try church and volunteer work.
I got a full scholarship in one of the best colleges here, I'm proud of it but I'm also a dropout (she never congratulated me but for sure remember how shit I'm for not accomplishing it). I get broke, we live together.
My grandmother passed away last month (the such disease I don't like to say it's name) and so life has becoming something else... It's painful. Not because I m sad about it but the whole process.
I felt for my aunt and cousin who I love desperately.  They two are the best people in the world. I feel sad for disappointing they.
I'm miserable. Numb. 

I take a medice and my mind is kinda blurry so probably don't expresses myself well. I reserved a hotel room for tonight, got some pills and think about a  wristcutter. Scary the hell out of me if it don't work. No one knows I'm about to do it and the place I'm it's not in lockdown. So today is the day.",Today will be the day,t3_gr2vsd,1

SuicideWatch,"hi. don’t know if this is the right place to post this. sorry if it isn’t. 

I really want to just kill my self right now. Only thing stopping me is the consequences if it doesn’t work. 

I was discharged from the mental hospital 2 months ago and everyone had such high hopes for me, and even I started having hope for myself, too. 
 I’m so gutted that I’m back at this place. I thought after that admission I wouldn’t be back in this situation of crisis. I thought I’d be okay. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s either 
A) I kill myself successfully and make everyone around me miserable 
B) I’m unsuccessful and I get sent back to the psych ward, just becoming even more of a disappointment to everyone close to me. 

I just don’t want life anymore. I just want to be with God. I want to not be on Earth anymore. Everything is so messed up right now, from covid to terrorism, and I feel too fucked up to be here in the first place. 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to talk to about this. I’m thinking of going to the councillor and telling her I’m planning my suicide, and hopefully she’ll send me to the mental health triage before I get the chance to actually fuck myself up. Why? I don’t knwo. Guess it’s just my last option. If she doesn’t do anything then so be it, I’ll just die I guess.

I don't understand how people can just work 40 + hours every week, have enough time to take care of errands, chores, and other necessities, and have time to hang out with their friends all without breaking down from exhaustion.
