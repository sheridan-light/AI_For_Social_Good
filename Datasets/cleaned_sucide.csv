SuicideWatch,"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",t3_cz6nfd,1

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here.

SuicideWatch,"I knew back then that I was in a shitty situation already. Being raised as a male, living first 20 years of my life with trauma, self-hate and repression fucked my mind pretty badly. And male hormones fucked my body beyond any hope that I'll be anything other than a slightly feminized dude on hormones.

It was stupid and pointless. But I decided to try anyway and now I'm here. It did reduce some pain but in a way it made it worse.

Now I have a small glimpse of what's it like to be a woman. And I know I'll never experience the rest, no matter what. I'll always be stuck being this manly awkward, borderline uncanny valley figure. My body will always carry the incredible damage done to it by male hormones.

I've been transitioning for 3+ years and results are beyond disappointing. I didn't grow boobs, I didn't get a feminine face, my butt didn't grow and stayed square and flat. My hips didn't widen, I got no waist and despite spending a fortune on laser hair removal it''s still everywhere. 

I would give up anything in my life to be able to go back to the point before puberty ruined me and start transitioning. Knowing what awaits me in the future, I'll lie, steal, manipulate people, do sex work what ever. Anything is better than the hell I'm stuck in right now.

I fucking hate what my life has become because of me being unlucky enough to be born trans. I hate being trans more than anything. All it gave to me is endless suffering and knowledge that no matter what I do I'll still be in this fucked situation.

There's no point in continuing living at this point but I'm just too weak. I didn't kill myself before starting transitioning because I was too weak. I won't kill myself now because I'm weak. Pathetic.

SuicideWatch," I'm extremely sorry if I violate a community guideline though this post, but I'm desperate. This post is not for me but for my girlfriend, we have been together for 6 months but ever since from the beginning I realized she had some serious problems regarding her happiness. 

Her biological father is abusive, manipulative and a complete maniac, he threatens her, and humiliates her she has told me about how he has said things like ""I will stop paying for your education"" ""I will stop paying your mother's house and you will live in the streets"" she even told me that he had threaten to beat her until she passed out, so on and so forth. I suspect that her mother depends from his father financially speaking.  When she told him about our relationship he treated her like a slut and tried to convince her that I was going to manipulate her. He even said that I was a sociopath just to get her away from me. He is the main reason she has so much problems. 

I have advise her about get professional help instead of only seeking help from friends and myself (which is totally ok , but we can offer limited help) but she hasn't done it. She has endured many hardships in life, from familiar problems, abusive relationships, she endured 8 years of bullying and treatment from a abusive partner for 5 months. Recently I thought that she was happy with her life, I try to make everyday she is with me the best possible. She had a new group of friends that truly love her and she is doing great at school and I genuinely thought she was happy.

I have wanted to make the time she spends with me a time that she can forget of her problems, but I feel that I failed her, she is still unhappy. Recently she started to act very strange she started crying when I told her that she is beautiful, she also believes that she is not good enough for me, she hates her body. She suffers from a low self-esteem and I want to help her. She has nightmares that go from dreaming that I cheat on her, to being rapped and brutally murdered in the street, this dreams occur every night, she even told me that she is afraid to sleep because of this nightmares.  

Now I would post this here if it was only that. Today as of the day I post this she has told me that something happened she didn't want to talk about it but she was crying like I have never seen in my life. She was broken and the worst part I couldn't help her. She didn't want my help instead she wanted to find the comfort she always receive from me but I fucked up. I was asking her again and again to tell me what happened, she always refused to the point she hung up and started talking to some other friend about it. Latter on she called me again and told me very calmly that she needed my comfort she wasn't mad or anything she just told me that. Then she left to her father's house, he lives very far away from me, so I cant see her this weekend. 

I did what I did because I, myself has had a close experience dealing with suicide, the moment she called me and started crying I felt it she was broken, something made her want to die. I don't know if she has made any suicidal gestures before. After the second call we texted each other, she told me that she had enough, that she wanted to die, that she doesn't have the strength to keep fighting her situation. I'm very concerned because she had this situation that she refuses to talk about and she is stuck with the person she hates the most during the weekend. To this point she is somewhat calm, I tried to remind her of her loved ones like her mother and friends, I also reminded her of our plans for the future I told her about some ideas I had to propose to her when we entered college, so far I think she isn't going to do anything but I'm not so sure, she may be trying to hide her motives from me, she told me that she wouldn't try to do anything in her father's house, but again I'm not sure.

I need help, because I'm running out of options and I want to make her feel safe, I thought to contact my own psychiatrist to help me with this situation. I also thought to tell my parents about it but they have very mixed opinions of her (she suspects about this) so I don't want to make them think badly of her (the opinion of my parents means a lot to her and I don't want to make her feel bad about it). My final option is to contact her mother and tell her about this, but she would have to tell the father and I don't know how he would react to this, he could go mental, hurt her mentally or physically and worsen the situation. But again this is my last option if she plans to take her life in that house. Like I said I'm desperate, it is very possible that all I'm saying is inappropriate, after all I'm 16 years old. I'm very naive and stupid so I would appreciate any help with this situation. Thanks in advance.

SuicideWatch,"I am a dumb fucking idiot. I have been trying to better myself by going out more and seeing new places- a suggestion from my mom and her boyfriend. Probably because I’m so pale- lol. I never go out except work. Haven’t travelled out more than an couple of hours since I was a kid. (Im 20F in USA)

So I when I got back from my mom’s, I let my roommates (my sis+ her gf) know that “hey I’m going to the art museum!” To have some “me time” I guess. Well 50 mins later, I get there, and it’s in the heart of the city- construction and people everywhere. No idea where anything is- and the museum parking is closed. think “not a big deal. I can find another parking garage” - and I did find one - about 10 minutes walk from the museum. I go in, not realizing it’s a parking garage for a business tower. There’s no walkway to the street from the garage- other than through that business tower. I realized I would probably look really out of place if I tried to go inside. So giving up on my museum plans, I went back to my car and cried. I was just so stressed out and afraid, to find another garage, or to find my way through the business tower. How fucking pathetic is that? My worst fear, that someone would talk to me. I drive another hour, all the way back home. Accomplishing nothing.

So after this waste of time and energy- I decide I should push myself for not going to the museum, and to go 4 hours (255 miles) south to see a friend I haven’t seen in 2 years, instead! Giving her like barely a 24 hour notice. Why?!? I don’t know!!

So I tell my roommates that I’m going to visit someone instead. They are a little thrown off, understandably because I went all the way to the museum, to look for a parking garage, and just left. 2 hours round trip.

Anyway. This morning, I leave at 7 am to visit my friend. I’m excited but nervous because I made her give up her entire day just to hang out with me. we aren’t even that close anymore our lives are so different. I drive. 4 hours just to see her. On my way, I fucking realized how not okay this is. I had nothing else to do there. I get there. We talk on the couch for like an hour, we go get food, we sit and talk for another few hours. It was a lot of fun catching up with her and conversation is ok, but awkward at times. I leave. Saying my work needs me back tomorrow. Which was a lie. I really just didn’t want to overstay or be a burden. I know how selfish and ridiculous this REALLY is. That was about 4 hours ago. 

So like the reasonable and sensible person I am, I rented a hotel for the night. Because I didn’t want anyone to see me come home tonight. Because, like the museum ‘visit’- nothing happened. So now I’m stuck in this hotel. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just feel like I can’t function anymore. I can’t walk down the fucking street to go to an art museum. That I drove so long to see. I can’t hold conversations. I can’t talk to cashiers- I just stumble my words. It feels every conversation I’m in just melts and becomes this incredibly painful situation that I want to get out of. I’m so self entitled and self centered it’s unbelievable. I care so much about what other people think of me. It’s eating me up inside. That every friend I’ve ever had will eventually start hating me because I can’t hide this abysmal side of myself. I am at my core a rotten fucking person who is so bullheaded that I don’t realize when I’m being a bitch or making things awkward. I just feel so inept in so many ways I just never want to go home. I don’t want anyone to see me ever again.",I have no idea what I’m doing anymore,t3_gox2go,1
SuicideWatch,"Please let me die with dignity and grant me the opportunity to end my life peacefully. Stop telling me that it will get better because it really won't. While there are fleeting moments of joy, the overall experience is rather dismal. Happy pills don't work and only make me a compliant zombie, therapy is just a subtle persuasion tactic to force me to act ""normal,"" and in-patient care is just a traumatic experience in its own right.

I'm sick and tired of slowly wasting away when I can just end it all. My entire life is nothing but a miserable existence, so don't fucking tell me that I ""have so much to live for"" or that my life is ""precious and worthwhile."" I am only here as a failed attempt to save a toxic marriage that only ended in divorce, a by-product of two people's foolish decisions.

I'll never be normal or socially acceptable, and people need to come to terms with the fact that not everyone can be saved. Hell, some people don't want to be saved and would love to die peacefully in a comfortable hospital bed. Instead, we have to resort to barbarism and blow our brains out or commit other gruesome acts of suicide.

You think I want someone to see my mutilated, decomposing corpse? No: I just want to die peacefully without causing unnecessary harm. Instead, I have to endure the aftermath of past trauma and bear the heavy burden of knowing that I am irreversibly damaged beyond repair. 

And just to add insult to injury, I can't end my suffering in a dignified and humane manner. I either have to die naturally or attempt to end my life, which could cause irreversible damage itself should I survive. So what do you expect me to do? Forcing me to be like you won't work, nor will meaningless words of encouragement persuade me to gain the strength to persevere.

I won't kill myself since numerous past attempts have proven to be fruitless, though I certainly won't try to be normal or lead a socially acceptable life since I'm too fucked in the head to blend in. Until I am granted access to a peaceful, painless death; don't bother convincing me that there's hope because I lost optimism a long time ago.

one day i might just quit.

hoping someone might just ask…

“Hey are you okay? And what are they?”

Quick back story, I've been without a relationship for 6 years, have no friends left, and no idea what it is about me that not only doesn't attract others, but seems to push others away.

I kind of scoffed at their loneliness from ppl posting about the pain, especially those who were in quarantine with significant others, friends, or family members.

Today, though, I went out for groceries. I left early afternoon so I could try to get steak before it was gone, and all I see while driving is so many ppl with others walking the streets like there's no virus. No masks till I got to the grocery store.

The whole experience kinda got in my head. Ppl are still out there, able to socialize and make friends/lovers. It was only on the ride home that it hit me...

I'm alone. I've been alone so much of my life I've tricked myself to thinking it's ok. But when covid hit, I kinda felt less alone. From reading loneliness posts I felt like part of a group. I thought others out there were feeling some of my pain. For some reason that made me feel better.

I didn't follow through with my plan, but the note still lies on my nightstand.

I didn't have the courage to end it all, mainly because I didn't want to feel any pain. I'd prefer to die in an accident where nobody blames themselves. So nobody feels guilty for having been able to help me.  But nobody could have helped me anyway. This is what I've wanted for such a long time. For such a long time. The only thing that keeps me from doing it, is the fact that I have to be in a wedding this year and I don't want the bride to suffer. Or the other bridesmaids to feel pain in my absence. Because that day should not be about me. I don't want to be remembered. I want to be forgotten. I believe that we only feel pain of loss because of our egos. But people, animals, and ideas die every day and we feel nothing. We feel nothing because we have no egoic connection to it. And that's how I feel about my own life. How I feel about being human. And I don't want to be a human anymore.

This life is not one that is worth living. Perhaps I am cynical. Or dark. But nothing seems worth it to me. The idea of having a perfect job, a perfect house, with a perfect family. The idea of those things doesn't make me happy and I think that they would make me want to end it even more feeling trapped in someone else's ideal world. In someone else's dream. 

I thought I wanted to travel the world. And I did. But that didn't make me happy. Because the vision of the place in your head is always better than the reality. And the vision is what keeps you going until you realize that these picture perfect places aren't real. I thought I wanted to be an entrepreneur, tried running my own business but that didn't make me happy either. The friendships I have feel unsatisfying. The family I have feels disconnected. I feel an obligation to these people. To love them. But in reality I feel nothing. I suppose on some deep subconscious level I really do care about them. Or I wouldn't feel uncomfortable thinking about the guilt they'd feel in my death. Going over and over what they could have done to help me.

I am cynical. I have a dark view of the human existence. I have a dark view and I have to live with it everyday.

I told my wife that she can and should leave me and I’ll support her fully if she wants. Especially if it will save her life if she hates me that bad. She doesn’t want that either. I wouldn’t want me either. I told her I would continue the arrangement we have currently - she gets everything and I just get an air mattress in a studio apartment. She says no. No reasoning.  

I work hard and help people in my job and I give my family everything I earn so they get everything they could have ever wanted and they treat me like crap for it. No they hate me.

I blame myself for having made the decisions that ended up here. 

Nothing I do will ever be enough for anyone. No success in life makes up for failure at home. 

There is no solution for this. I’m at the pinnacle and things will
Only get worse.

Sometimes suicide is the answer (for me). 

I hope I’ve made my case. I Know that I have depression and some people may be happy with success. So don’t take this message and give up hope.","I am successful, healthy &amp; wealthy: these are the reasons I’m killing myself - I’m posting in hopes someone will learn from my mistakes.",t3_goxj22,1

SuicideWatch,"I think I am such an idiot that I could very well be Darwin Awards nominee. 
Couple of years ago I arrived in Canada with the intention to study in university and get a degree,  but the new environment, homesickness, depression, cultural differences, “long desired freedom” and countless other reasons, that in hindsight are just smart sounding excuses, created changes in those plans. 

During the first year in uni I got into drugs, alcohol and parties. Nothing serious drugs and alcohol wise but by the end of the year it was certain that I am not gonna make it to a second year and would have to leave Canada and go back home. I didn’t want that. Like a complete idiot I simply said to my parents that everything is fine and I am still studying. 

For more than 2 years I kept saying this lie but in reality I lived in Canada without visa, without degree, without any desire to change things. I lived alone in rented apartment reading novels, watching films basically being unproductive, antisocial waste. I simply didn’t think of consequences and didn’t care how it all would end up. Even right now I  do not care much about what will happen to me but imagining my mom makes me feel immense guilt for the things I’ve done.

Less than a year ago I started translating novels from my native language into English just for fun and ended up earning a bit from it, so at last something started going on in my life. I started cleaning up my habits, until recently I was reminded that my passport will soon expire. 
So here I am not knowing what to do. To be honest my options are quite limited. Come clean and get deported. Create another convoluted and disgusting lie about how I got my passport renewed and live without a passport as an illegal immigrant. Go full Hollywood style and get a fake passport. I even seriously contemplated suicide as a solution. 

On one hand I truly don’t want face the consequences of my own actions. On the other hand something finally started to make sense in my life. I am sure that if I had a chance to go back in time all this wouldn’t have happened. I wouldn’t have to lie to my parents living life of a disgusting parasite and hurting them, living without direction and any desire. I regret last 5 years of my life.
If I go back to my hometown, I would probably face jail time. Draft dodging and all that.

To be honest writing everything down right now made me realize that I don’t want to go back home and face my parents. Any option right now seems whole lot more appealing than logical and right thing to do, even eating a bullet. I know its a cowards way out but...",I am an idiot,t3_gowzlv,1

SuicideWatch,"For the first time today, I didn’t wake up from the rushing beat of my heart. The usual anxiety I felt every morning from your symptoms was gone, in its stead, something more insidious kept me asleep. I laid in bed for hours, my eyes felt like deserts after all the days and nights I spent mourning your infection, looking at the bland white walls grow endlessly over my head and imposing my new confinements. My hands were not strong enough to lift me up and and start another day of tending to your emotional and physical pain, and my mind did not flood with it’s usual barrage of terrifying visions of blinding white rooms and foreboding IV drips, but rather it  incapacitated me with a silence so familiar that I realized that, in focusing all of my energy in keeping you well taken care of, I became ill as well.

It’s so silly to think that just months before we were planning our lives together. We looked at cities to live in, obsessed over the little landmarks and hot spots that we’d have all our countless dates in, marveled each other with love promises, charting the stars and looking up at the moon as we made a promise to always remember we would be under the same sky no matter what would happen. 

You are the first person to ever made me feel this excited about life, never had I seen the world around filled with so much color, it was as if you took my hand, took me to the blank and bleak outside world, and delicately painted every single flower, gave detail to every single grass blade, and turned the entire world from a monotone blank canvas into a masterpiece for me to gawk at. Your soothing voice replaced the ever deafening silence that made life so miserable for me. You gave me a future to think about, told me how you would always protect me no matter what danger I’d go through, that you would not have betrayed me like the many abusers that came before you, and made me feel like I was no longer alone in the world. No friend ever gave me so many laughs, no teacher such learning, and no family such love. You made me feel human and you became the pillar that supported my entire person.

Just as it seemed as if our lives were going to be the happiest they’ve ever been, the dragon came on that dreadful Sunday evening and our hearts sank as we saw it scorch our lives.

I never thought that you’d find yourself in this condition. You were so healthy, so strong, and so energetic. Your blazing energy was snuffed out by the fatigue, you felt weakness for the first time as the muscle aches kept you awake at night, and your health was consumed by fiery undying fever. Your happiness and cheerful disposition were snuffed out as your mind was forced into the sadness only demons from your past have ever caged you in. You always told me not to worry, that you would be ok, but I wanted to fight for you and take this matter in my own hands. I tried my hardest to keep you fed, to make sure you were hydrated, to bring a smile to your face and keep reassuring you that we would be winning this war. I know you found the water bottles, the constant meals, and the It’s been two weeks and you’ve started to feel better. The fever still blazes through the war-torn battlefield, but the pains are gone. Your smile has slowly returned, despite of the dark clouds of the fatigue still pouring over the ruins of our garden. You say you feel better, but seeing how hard this has effected has destroyed me.

As we both sleep in the trenches awaiting the next morning’s battle, I need to ask you for forgiveness. 

Forgive me for not having done more, even if you say I did more than anyone ever has done for you.

Forgive me for having hid my pain behind a fake smile, trying to look strong when it came down to direct treatment and then coming down to my knees and breaking down as you slept.

Forgive me for not having kept you happy as the dragon scorched the kingdom you built for us and you fell into the darkest corner of your mind.

Forgive me for letting my anxiety get the best of me and throw my fears at you like spears when you already had to withstand the fires of the fever, the blows of the body aches, and the miasma of your mental state as it deteriorated.

Forgive me for having stopped taking care of myself and dedicating all of my resources to you. I prayed every night, praying to whoever was there to hear my pleas to make us switch roles, asking for a supreme power to take my life in exchange of keeping yours intact forever. I sacrificed sleep, I sacrificed my food, and I sacrificed myself entirely to the cause of curing you.

You’re no longer as sick as when you started, and I believe you’ll make it to the end of the tunnel, but I never realized the dragon came from behind me, and how it scorched everything you had done for me. The colors I once indulged in are gone and replaced by a lifeless monotone white, the visions of the future are shattered, and even when surrounded by friends and family that want to help us out, I have never been more alone. 

The last thing I have to ask your to forgive me for is for having lost myself when I was all you ever wanted in your life. I disappointed you.

Please, forgive me for whatever I do when the silence of my head will be so loud that I won’t be able to remember you.","That Dragon, Coronavirus",t3_gowwqo,1

All of my life I've been in such a self-hate state of mind, when I was a kid there where so many times were I just go and kick my head against a wall or just punch myself in my stomach untill throwing up, I always hated myself so much that untill now I can't even see myself in a mirror. I've never suffered from bullying, but domestic violence was present as I was growing up, things got better tho. And dont get me wrong, I love my mother so much, and always tried to be the best son to her. I've always been academicly recognized, and I'm currently on my fifth year at architecture school. I'm an introvert, talking to people is so hard for me beacuse I've never had anyone to talk to. I'm currently 22 yo, and still hate myself so much, I fantasize about my death all day long, I've put knifes to my throat and to my chest, I've been several times on the border of a cliff, and I just can't take the last step, I'm such a coward.

This finally took its toll on her and today, she decided to leave me, I don’t hate her, I hate myself for putting her in a position she felt like she had to leave me. I think that was the tipping point for me. For hours now I’ve been extremely low and the impulses to just get it over and done with are so overwhelming. I don’t think I can fight any longer. I’m ready. I just needed to say this one thing. Thank you for taking the time to read it, I hope you all find happiness.

I kind of want to switch my major to something that would force me to start over from the beginning and go from 0k in debt to tens of thousands of dollars in debt and two years behind. I don't even know why I want to switch. I'm pretty sure a big part of it is that my only friend is majoring in what I want to switch to. I'd considered the major before he officially declared it a month or so back, but all of a sudden I'm gung-ho and switch majors. I just don't know what to do with my life. I have no idea what to major in, I have no idea what I want to get a job in. I don't hate my current internship (graphic design/marketing) but for some reason I just don't want to continue in it. All of these huge decisions and the stress of trying to figure all of my life out before it's too late to register for classes and the stress of taking out loans and the stress of a new Walmart job and the stress of trying to decide what I'll do for probably the rest of my life is killing me. I spend all day crying, I sleep 14 hours a night, I fantasize about killing myself almost constantly, I just can't keep doing this.

SuicideWatch,"The only true point of life would be to survive until you get a child that can carry on your genes, that is all, everything else is built around this purpose in one way or an other. However most women and even men, and that is logical, are looking for someone with enough money to support a family and in good shape. True, we could try to work our ass off to get that one ass we are looking for.    


But with how fucked up the world is why even care to try and accomplish that goal? It is not for nothing that people taking care about the environement, and surely not only them, are talking about how we are only letting garbage for other generations to take care of. Beside that, we are already in surpopulation. So even the sole purpose of life, or at least giving life, can be seen as pointless and even dangerous in our current time.   


As horrible as it can sound, the only thing that kept us from overpopulating too quickly this planet were wars and illness, but now that those two are mostly out of the way for the main part of humans, we are facing a new way of being doomed by our own will to survive as a race. Talk about some irony.   


It is not so much about me wondering about killing myself or not, but more about what is even the point on trying anything anymore, to care about things. Because I sure do not feel like doing it and even if I wanted, could do so. My mother will throw me out of the house with some money to buy a studio, i'll surely be expelled after like 3 months or so due to me not being able to pay since I will have no job because I failed my schoolarity and from this point will most likely live under neath a bridge.

I was born... let’s just say weird. 
My father comes from a family line filled with troubles, and he has high functioning anxiety he has never treated. 
I have depression since i was a child and with time developed worse mental health issues due to being called fat by my family or stupid from my school partners ALL OF MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD. At some point i discovered i had OCD but guess what, no one cared about it so i never got a treatment and had to deal with it by myself.

Then my parents got divorced. And a bunch of shit has happened ever since. So now i feel no connection to my family, my friends don’t love me enough, i am still fat, i have acne scars, and feel uncapable of being happy anymore. I had a large amount of panic attacks and also all my paternal family believes i am lazy, a bad influence, the cousins i used to play with when my life was not this hate me, and my memory issues do not allow me to remember the time that wasn’t suffering.

I have tried to discuss my issues with my parents a few times.I am close with my mother, but don't know why whenever I try to discuss any serious life related issues/decisions with her she turns aloof.On the other hand, my father is ready to discuss, but he is very proud,dominating, controlling and bitter natured.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, i'm 21 years old and i'm from Chile. I'll try to be brief, but i want to give a little backstory to what's going on with me lately begining with my childhood. 

My life's never been easy probably like most of the people around here. I was bullied by my classmates when i was younger because i was fat and shy *(including some degree of physical violence, not that terrible like most thing i've heard though).* Most of the time my grandfather *(who's my father figure since my father apparently abandoned us and later passed away*) and my mother acted as my emotional pillars as well as teaching me to be nice, kind. Thanks to my grandfather i learned to stay positive no matter what. My mom however is somewhat depressive and tends to lose it a lot *(this also affected me)*. My mom, my stepdad and my grandparents overprotected me a lot as well, so if anything ever happened to me they would inmediatly attack anyone who tried to harm me, sometimes  even when it was not big deal at all. 

2010 and 2011 in particular were very rough years for us. After Chile 2010's earthquake i started having panic attacks like everyday and it was horrible, my parents were having economic problems as well. To make matters even worse, my Arts teacher, who's was my ""main"" teacher that year always tried to make me look like a bad student and a bad boy, even tho most of the past teachers though and said otherwise. This lead to my whole class rejecting me, on top of being unable to shower due to the money shortage as well as the fact i had a fight with my only two friends because of this teacher, which led them to reject me as well and leaving me alone. I spent 2011, 2012 and part of 2013 alone with no friends at all. **During this time i had my first suicidal thoughts and tried to suffocate myself, once. I stopped because my family needed me and i couldn't fail them.**

My life started to recover afterwards and everything seemed a bit brighter... Thanks to my parents, grandmother and specially my grandfather.

My grandfather passed away during mid-2015 and this led me to an emotional breakdown, a horrible and chilling one. My past self started to fade away entirely, no longer being the kind and nice guy. I tried to fill the emptiness with whatever i could, friends, family, videogames, anime, food *(I lost a lot of weight before and after this event i started gaining weight once again).* In the end, i tried out love, and it turned out for worse.. 

To be brief, once again. I became obssesed with a girl i met online who had a bf on another country. I was so overly obssesed with her i even tried to harm both of them *(somehow, i guess).* In  the end she blocked me and it took me a really long time to recover from that event. **I had suicidal thoughts once again, but never tried to harm myself**. Afterwards i sweared to god i would never ever become obssesed about someone ever again... And as you will read soon, i failed miserably.

After this event i had my **first and second gf** (both of them manipulated me and the latter cheated on me). **Nothing really special** here, those relationships just failed. **My third gf** however, was a special case. This was the first person i truly fell in love with and loved. Our breakup hurted me so badly i couldn't get over her loss thus leading me to be in another relationship in a desperate attempt to forget her. This fourth relationship was horribly toxic and lasted two years, including manipulation and some sort of physical abuse from her. I also had my first sexual experience with this person. **This girl changed me because i inherited part of her toxic personality as seen during my last two relatonships.**

Also before this fourth relationship i finished school and begun studying architecture, moving from a small city to the capital, huge change if you ask... caused panic attacks to come back at me. During all those years i struggled a lot with my career, my family as well as the fact that my school friends stopped talking to me entirely after we split up, leaving me once again alone with only my family and distant friends to help me out. Later on i would meet new friends who helped me out all the way until now, preventing me to take some dumb choices of life.

Anyway, right after this breakup i spent several months believing i was finally free and better. This was true and my **fifth relationship** was truly awesome save for one fact... She had a psychological issue that truly complicated our relationship a little bit. We never had a fight, we never had a problem.. but.. i felt that the right choice was to broke up with her to protect both of us, and so i did... I hurted me so much to leave her, **she taught me a lot, i loved her, i was her first irl bf and also her first kiss (nearly first time as well).** We both suffered a lot, but it was for the better and i'll always carry her on my heart.

**And so... with such a huge baggage on my back came my sixth relationship, almost a year ago. This is where my current problems lie at**. I really fell in love with this girl, and to this day i believe she's the love of my life. But my baggage, insecurities, toxic personality and everything quickly showed up and ruined everything. I behaved like a cellopath, controller, and toxic obssesive asshole almost like a psycopath, yes, obssesive, i failed to myself once again. I turned my love into obssesion and harmed her. We broke up, then came back, broke up again and it was all over... I've lost her. She gave everything to me and i didn't gave a shit. **My breaking point came, and i tried to commit suicide once again, throwing myself out the window of my apartment. I just couldn't take it anymore. University, love, family, friends everything felt apart at the same time and made me break. I was... one centimeter away from falling that night, to end it all, but i didn't. I saw my grandfather sitting next to me. He didn't wanted me to give up, and so i did.**

**It was all over?.. No. I begun my seventh (and to this day final) relationship.** I'm not going to talk a lot about this. I hurted this girl, badly like, i truly broke her heart, player around, enforced her to do things she didn't like at all (not physical, only text-based or emotional).  I made her hate me and faulted everything in my life to her, like she was the one responsible for my misery when i was the truly miserable jackass who just couldn't get over his past. 

I thought... my grandfather should truly be ashamed of me, he didn't taught me to be like this. My mother *(then seriously worried i would try to commit suicide again)* would feel ashamed too.

Supported by both my family and friends.. i decided to change, give myself a time to reflex and think. And i found myself, i found that kid who was happy before, even with everything he suffered so far, felt better, became better and got over my past, or most of it... it seems.

When i believed everything was closed up i tried to patch up my relationship with my now two ex-gf. The seventh never replied back, the sixth did.. and.. I realised i still loved her, even with everything that happened, i still felt a huge love and devotion for her, not the obssesive one.

Sadly... she didn't. And i tried to bring her back to me, it wasn't possible. She just couldn't forget what happened and hurted me so much, because my love for her is huge.. but i failed to her. And lost my way because of this, because i was past-driven most of my life, and i lost myself only to find myself and realize the one person i wanted forever in my life was gone. **Last week i thought of ripping my arm open until i bleed out, but i just couldn't bring myself to try such a thing again. I have the means to do it, it's just the fact i'm not able to.** I know my grandparents, my parents and everyone else who cares about me would suffer if i did such a thing, but i barely feel any emotion nowadays, i'm not able to cry anymore, i just, laught out of pain.

Love is obviously the least important thing here, **my guilt is what's driving me insane now.** Having her close is a constante reminder of what i did, what i used to be, how bullshit i was. 

I've been my entire life with psychologist and psychiatrist treatment if you ask.  I just need a helping hand, someone telling me there's something after this, and really giving me a real reason to not give up beside my family, friends and career (I'm not able to find a reason on them). **Guilt is really driving me mad... and i don't know how long i'll be able to handle this before i kill myself.**",(Long Post) I really need some help. I didn't broke any law but i feel horribly guilty.,t3_gorem4,1
SuicideWatch,"So I finally decided to go through with partial suspension hanging because I read online that it was far more painless than fully hanging yourself. I put the rope with a slipknot around my neck high as possible standing on a bag of garden soil so my feet wouldn't touch the ground &amp; leaned back (knot front of neck so I could breathe) with as much weight as possible &amp; thought I passed out but then about 30 seconds later I was either having a very intense seizure, extreme convulsions, or a stroke.. All of a sudden I was just shaking so badly while wide awake &amp; was unaware what was happening for a min then I had a panic of cold fear &amp; had to undo the knot it was so hard to get undone but i did it &amp; my head was pounding, had petechia dots on my face &amp; bad bruising from the knot when I went inside &amp; looked in the mirror while wondering if I had brain damage, i feel the same as before now but I'm terrified to try partial again after this...

when i was 18 my dog died and my whole life fell apart
i never thought sth could destroy my life like that
been feelin guilty, unworthy of living, like a waste of skin &amp; oxygen and just like a life form that shouldn't be
i cannot help ppl close to me bc i get either too close to help em (i feel their struggle so much that i'm not able to help em) or i get aggressive over irrelevant bullshit
i don't have patience at all
i'm a melting point of emotions, i'm always nervous and thoughts overwhelm me
my brain cannot shut up
been doin drugs since i was 16, was semi-forced into a psychiatry at some point, diagnosed with severe depression there

now, almost 2 yrs ago i met my girlfriend, the most compassionate, smartest, trustworthiest and overall beautiful person i've ever met
stopped doing drugs for her
she's been thru a lotta shit too

i felt like having a meaning to my life, sth that is worth living for, someone all the bullshit is worth going thru for

she has been struggling a lot since January
she told me that i shouldn't be that emotional and give her more space prior to her current struggle

i tried to not let it get to me and didn't write much
i tried thinking of ways to help her and i did not come up with anything
when i asked, i got no response
i did not know what to do and feared losing touch with her
i told her that too

now some time ago i wrote her that i love her, that i support her and wish her good night
she responded that i should stop the ""i love you"" bc it doesn't fit anymore

phewww, that hit

she then said she has a lot on her plate and that we can talk abt us when the time is right
when i asked again if we could talk she asked when i'd finish school finals
sounded like she doesn't want our break up to affect my grades

in the meantime i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts from waking up to falling asleep, sometimes textbook depression, at other times with a melting point of emotions in me
been thinkin of buying razor blades bc i used to cut myself a lot before we got together

my emotions are currently killing me, i will not survive a break up
this life never made sense until i met the most amazing person there is
a person that is willing to take my whole personality bc i'm worth it... that was beautiful
i took her the same way
if that is gone my life is shambles, drugs &amp; self-harm again

i will not survive fucking up my life like that
how could i mess up the most beautiful person there ever was?!

For the last several years, I was smoking weed, and somehow coping with all the shit that is in my head. After the 1,5 month quarantine and taking Xanax to cope with the chaos inside my head, weed stopped working on me, it just doesn’t take the edge off like it used to do.

I guess this was the moment when everything started falling and the reality started to settle in.

I’m sitting now alone and empty in my condo, and I can’t take anymore all the overthinking, maniacal episodes, and depression after. I’m just so dead inside that I can’t change anything about it.

Whole my life I was an outsider, even when I was living in a small village, all the kids at school treated me like I was an alien, they even told me once to my face that I must be from another planet. I just wanted to belong and be like other people. To live normally without drastic overthinking and overwhelming ambitions that are destroying me every day of my life.

I was trying to fill the hole that I have inside with buying all kinds of shit throughout my young adult years, it was working for some time I can't lie, but at some point, it stopped making happy.

I just wanna love, and have someone that will be there for me no matter what, but it seems impossible at this point.

I’ve never been able to imagine a future for myself but the thought of finally being myself someday helped me hold on and the fear of being remembered as a woman kept me from killing myself many times. but I’ll never be a real man and I’ll never have my parents approval and I’ll never be allowed to exist without having to defend my right to. so I guess I’ll just become part of that 41% statistic people always go on about. but that doesn’t matter.

This year i decided to get some help and go to a psychiatrist in order to get everything back to what I assume is normal. Everything went alright for a couple of months, but due to the COVID problem I ran out of meds while self-isolating and i was left with my dark thoughts without a way out of this nightmare. 

  The world seems to crumble around me. I hate my life at this point and I want to end it all. My best friend who helped me reach out doesn't know all of my problems and thoughts, I am afraid of pushing her away, I feel like I am not her problem since she has anxiaty and depression herself and she needs to have positive things around her to get better and I try to give her all the support I can give while dealing with my problems.

  I am here to write my last fantasy, the last thing ever iwanna do before hanging myself and ending all of my problems forever. I want someone to read it and if someone is in my situation and really decided to end it all and can't have his mindset changed, maybe try it and see if the life is worth living or not. 

  So i wanna call all my closest friends, all the people that were around me, the people who helped and supported me and hang out, turn off my phone and just go for a night in the town, drinking having fun, laughing with them. I wanna be the happiest person they ever seen, I wanna sit with them at a pub look at them and then think to myself ""The people that surround me are so beautiful"".  After the night is over and I had the best night of my life, give them all a tight long hug and before we go apart tell them ""Take care of yourselves, will ya'?"". After that, I'll go into my garage and  hang myself thinking about them and how I had the best time of my life around them.

  I don't want them to remember me as the sad piece of shit, the good for nothing man that I am, I want to be in their memory as the happiest, most positive and supportive person in their lives which never thought twice before helping them.

  Many times i've heard that the happiest people in your life are secretly depressive or suicidal, always thought it's bullshit, but now that i am in that situation i understand why, nobody and i mean NOBODY wants to be remembered in someone's as the saddest person in the world and i don't want that either.

  None of my friends know about my reddit account, I keep it private. But if one of them stumbles upon it in the future and see this post I WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVED YOU SO MUCH THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT CAN DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS FOR ANY OF YOU AND I DIDN'T DO WHAT I DO BECAUSE OF YOU AND I DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT WE COULDN'T SPEND MORE DAYS TOGHETHER.

SuicideWatch,"Having a pity party for myself, don't know how much more I can take. 
Long story short, I (25m) was raped when I was a kid, don't know my dad, was born with one hand, grew up in poverty, mother (single parent) was/is an abusive bipolar alcoholic, my older brother lost his mind a few years back to the point you can't have a conversation with him without him accusing you of being an alien or some sort of spy etc (paranoid schizophrenic) . My mother also attemped suicide a few years back, she ended up in ICU for a week, is still an abusive drunk unfortunately. 

From all this shit I naturally had some issues and suffered with depression and BPD and never really felt like life was worth living. I got myself through university, got myself a great job but it meant nothing. Then I fell in love, completely accidental, I met the most beautiful, intelligent, caring girl. For the first time ever I actually felt love and happiness. We planned the rest our lives together, we planned on buying a flat in the Netherlands, travelling the world, eventually marriage and kids. She died in December in front of me at only 24 from a tropical disease she caught whilst travelling abroad.

Not sure where to go from here, just feel so lost. Starting to believe I'm in hell.

I’m so lost it hurts, existing hurts. I’ve had it good in some ways but even then I’ve made some decisions that lead me down stupid paths.

My head is an ocean just fucking filled with past regrets, going over conversations, disgust from being mean to people and then going over the guilt.

I had things on track last year and I fucked that all up. How are people just normal? How do they go about just doing things? 

I don’t think I’ve ever been happy and that is shit. It’s the shittiest thing ever to realise you have never had fleeting moments of joy without anything in your head worrying you and that you’re a piece of shit. 

I really can’t do this anymore. There is no fucking God, there is no plan, there is no drive. I was born faulty.

SuicideWatch,"I can’t function and I wanna die before things get worse

I posted this elsewhere but maybe in the wrong place for what I’m looking for. So I’m reposting it here. 

I have ADHD, MDD, GAD, and BED (technically OSFED with binging traits since I sometimes fast to purge. So that was my official diagnosis). I’ve been on so many different meds for each and nothing ever seems to make a difference except when it increases my suicidal thoughts and I need to stop it. No stimulant seems to help me focus or with my impulsivity, even at high doses it’s less of a difference than coffee. I’ve tried several antidepressants over the years. I’ve been on the same SSRI for a year and a half now and it isn’t helping in the slightest, but no side effects I guess. Every add on or mood stabilizer has just worsened my anxiety. 

I’m 17. I have so much schoolwork I need to do and I just. Can’t. Get. It. Done. My brain feels like static all the time. When I try to focus its like driving through a tunnel and the radio glitches on and off. I email my teachers, I got to an alt school so they’re accommodating and they know I try and care a lot about school. But I can’t keep that up forever. I’m having panic attacks daily now, I used to only get them once a month. I keep getting told it often get worse before it gets better but I’ve been in therapy since I was 10 and I’ve just tumbled downward since.

It’s not just because of COVID. It was like this before, now it’s just harder to get help.

I got kicked out of my ED treatment for basically being too fat and not needing it, and the DBT team that is supposed to support me now is at a loss because they don’t specialize in eating disorders. With all the stress my binging is getting worse and more frequent, and it’s harder and harder to fast, exercise or purge. I’ve been gaining around 3.5lbs a week for the past 3 months and I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I’m so uncomfortable and feel so trapped. No one in my family seems to care or see a problem though.

I have so few friends if any really (overwhelming ADHD personality - or maybe I’m just an annoying/an asshole). Any interests I had are slowly fading away and it’s so heartbreaking. It’s like I’m an empty shell of the quirky kid I used to be. My hope for the future is lost. I can’t even function. I really tried to have things to look forward to, like going to see the re-united MCR in October (I’m a depressed teen who likes emo music lol), or the kitten I’m probably getting next month, but it’s not worth it. I’m really putting in the work in therapy and I’m just not making progress or seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Even if things could get better, I don’t want to take the chance that it could get worse.

There’s a few others things going on like occasionally physical abuse from my mom, gender/sexuality/identity issues, trauma from a forced hospitalization, but I don’t want to get into those.

I just

I wanna die. Every attempt has failed but I really really wanna just want this to stop. Before I gain anymore weight, fail another class, or spend another evening ugly sobbing, teeth chattering, with my arm in ice water to stop myself from cutting.

Honestly, I could probably live like this. And I wanna believe that basic functions can eventually become manageable and I could feel passionate about something again. I wanna go see MCR, take care of a cat, move somewhere up north cause I love the cold. But with the trajectory I’ve been on, I’d rather die before it gets worse.

God that sounds so fucking stupid and dramatic. I’m not sure why I wrote this or what I’m looking for. Attention maybe? A sign? Hope? Helpful resources? A friend? Im just an optimistic child trying to find reason to keep believing.

in the past few weeks i have actively been searching for different ways to go through with it, in the least painful way possible. a full proof plan, in a way. ( i don’t have access to guns) 

i am usually an actively positive person, who tries to reaffirm myself through writing and centering myself. i do try to eat healthy and exercise sometimes to get rid of these thoughts. i try to focus on my tasks at end, which have been extremely difficult lately &amp; has began to make me feel inadequate or resurfaced issues i felt i already worked through. i think the point i’m trying to make is, i have tried to work to be in a mental state. i have healed in some ways, but it seems in some others it’s just not going to happen for me.

i do have plans for the future, but these past few days it feels like these past twenty one years of my life have been enough, the memories and the love of everyone around me. its been enough.

I've always been depressed, always wanted to kill myself. I cried a lot, hated being around people, and people hated me. My dad worked from sun up to sun down. My mom is some sort of psycho that I can't place my finger on. I want to say narcissist. I would threaten to call CPS all the time, but she would just make the point that they would separate me and my sister, and probably end up with someone worse than her. I went to therapy at 12 years old because I kept imaging throwing myself in front of a train or oncoming traffic anytime I was out with her. I was hoping that they would help me get out of that house

I'm 23 now, and no one helped me. Now it's my responsibility to become a functioning adult while I'm still being abused by the same monster that made me this way. I'm tired. I'm tired of everything. I did everything I was supposed to do, and I still didn't get help. She just let more and more horrible things happen to me until I just crumbled under the shame and pain and the guilt. I was raped because of her. I ended up in hospitals because of her. I learned to not believe anyone could truly ever love me because that's what she wanted me to believe.

Everyone always tells me to keep going, things get better. But they literally haven't. The things people have told me about my situation; ""it's not real abuse"", ""you have no proof so we can't help you"" ""you'll understand a mother's love when you have kids"". I've been punished for being strong and being able to cope with certain symptoms better. Doctors thinking I'm lying about my adhd and anxiety and not getting proper medications (my diagnosis somehow got changed to bipolar disorder even though I've never been manic in my life), not being accepted to certain programs because I actually managed to graduate high school/I'm not on hard drugs/I've never been to jail. 

And yes, I obviously have thought about moving out. That's why I think about killing myself everyday. I can't. Almost no one I know that is my age can just move out of their parents place. I live in NYC, I can't afford rent on my own. I live off of SSI, I applied when I was 17. I was going to get off of it once I graduated college and got a decent paying job. 6 years later and I've dropped out 3 times and got hospitalized 3 times. What's that they say about insanity?

I'm tired of failing. I don't see any hope in my future. I can't even look myself in the mirror anymore.

The last 2 months have been a nightmare. I've always been the steadfast one in my family but I feel as if there is nothing left anymore. At 23 years old I never dreamed that I would have to go through something like this. On march 14, I went to my fathers house to work on a project. After not seeing him all day I went looking for him and found him in his bed, dead, with a gun in his hand. No note, no explanation, no warning. I had all of 3 seconds to turn around and tell my younger brother that our dad was gone. This was 10PM, and for the next 3 hours I spoke with deputy's, the sheriff, I had to call my mother (My parents have been divorced for 9 years), my grandma, and my sister and tell them the same. I was so angry, sad, confused. All I wanted was to be alone. 2 days later I lost my job because of covid-19.

I had to move back to my apartment (I worked at an outdoor education facility and lived on site). I lost my friends, my father, my job. I fell apart. I laid in bed for days at a time. I haven't had a night of sleep without a nightmare in over 2 months. I feel like moving across the country, trying to escape. Every time I pass anything that reminds me remotely of him, even the roads we would drive down together, I feel so sad, and lost. Its like I'm looking for something and I have no idea what it is anymore. There is just a void and I have no idea how to handle it. I'm trying to be so strong for the rest of my family. And every day no matter how hard I try I cannot stop thinking about him lying in his bed, alone, with god knows what going through his mind.

I just can't believe that he would ever leave us without telling us why. He was so happy, so proud. We had planned to go fishing the week after he died. I feel so lost. I put on a face as if I'm okay. I thought I had more friends. I thought more people cared about me. It seems like now they were only around me because of our circumstances that brought us together. I keep thinking back on times when I was surrounded by friends. My summers as a camp counselor, or my highschool days. I just want to go back. I was so incredibly happy and felt so blessed just 3 months ago. And now I go through my days searching for something to be happy about, for a purpose.","My father killed himself, and I was the one to find him. I feel lost and alone",t3_gobwth,1

SuicideWatch,Why isn't there anything for people without family or friends?

SuicideWatch,"I want to go ahead and say that this will probably be a long post.

So, I'm 22 years old. I have two associate degrees (business &amp; science) with top honors. I am apart of Phi Theta Kappa and won several area and regional awards- I've also broke records at the college I graduated from. My GPA is a 3.94 with 90+ hours (some are uni credits). I'm proud of my accomplishments and it's really the only thing I excel at honestly. The information I have learned is not really useful and I can't apply it to my everyday life. 

I grew up with 1 older brother and a mother &amp; father. All of which have verbally, emotionally, physically abused me at a young age. My mother is the absolute worst. She calls the cops on me, threatens me, black mails, and everything else you can possibly think of. She has hit me with her car and had me arrested because I didn't listen to what she wanted me to do. She is beyond narcissistic, manipulative, obsessive, and flat out crazy. She literally makes everyone's life a living hell because she simply enjoys it. I told my therapist if I suddenly die that my mom could have killed me (she's a nurse and knows A LOT). Also, my mother isolated me and kept me in the house constantly. She wouldn't let me go out with friends or go anywhere with them. She also was never home because she worked on the road (optional for her career), money was more important than being there for me when I was growing up. My brother used to be an alcoholic. He is 6' 8 and over 300lbs while I'm 5'6 and about 115lbs. He would throw me across the room, driving drunk with me in the car, and even got me arrested (which caused issues with my schooling) then I had to apologize to him. He acts just like my mother. He can never be wrong, he knows everything about anything. My brother was never really home because he was out drinking and parting with his 'friends'. I would try to talk to him and he would slam the door in my face. My father wanted nothing to do with me when I was young (much like my brother and mother). He bought me video games to 'shut me up' and keep me occupied so that I wouldn't bother anyone. His job kept him busy so he was never home for the most part. Needless to say, I'm not close with my family (and there is a lot I haven't mentioned about growing up). My family life is still pretty much the same at 22 years old. They still don't want much to do with me- unless it's giving me pure hell.

I have a boyfriend of 3.5-4 years now. He helped me get sober (off alcohol and drugs) right after we finished high school together. He was the first person to show me what love actually is and not based on how poorly my family has treated me. Eventually he quit showing me affection. While I tried to surprise him with little parties and things to help his day get better, I never received much of anything from him other than his money (which is something I DONT want- and he knows that). I feel like at this  point he gives me his money just to 'shut me up' and keep me busy just like my family does and it breaks my heart.

I have been raped 2 different times. Sexually assaulted 4 or 5 times by guys as well. I'm so scared it is going to happen again that I refuse to go anywhere alone- even to a gas station to fill my truck up.

I don't have friends. They all treat me like shit and only want to use me. I help get them off the street and give them everything I have to help them during their dark times only to be dropped off shortly after. The 'friends' I did have were the ones who sexually assaulted me. 

My therapist has no idea on what to do because everything around me is toxic and it's pushing me to the edge of suicide. I'm in a constant state of stress, anxiety, and fear. I have absolutely nowhere to go.  I've been in therapy for about 7 months now and absolutely NOTHING has changed for me. All she tells me to do is write shit down. I know it takes a while for things like this to get better but I'm at a loss.  She tells me that I have CPTSD (diagnosed by my doctor and therapist on multiple occasion) and chronic depression and anxiety. She tells me that my PTSD is a lot worse than average and she is constantly worried about me.

One time I held a gun to my head and someone told me I was selfish because this is what I wanted. But everyday that I'm alive I go through so much pain and suffering with no one around me to help me. I can't find any reason to live. I don't want kids or a family. I could careless about my career or even school at this point. I have tried to live day by day but I deal with so much crap that I can't or else I'll literally off myself. Everyone that I have asked for help or advice tell me that I have it the worst (out of every one they know) so they don't know what to tell me.

Nothing makes me happy. I just got a honda 250 that I enjoy but it's not worth me staying alive.  The thing is is that my ptsd and everything else is so damn draining and painful that there is nothing (that I'm aware of) that is worth me staying alive day to day to get to it. 

I have tried to change everything about my life but nothing ever works. It all comes back to the same bullshit.

My sister is hard working, capable and trustworthy. And I, well I am the fuck up. The lazy, worthless, piece of shit, and as my dad said ""everything i ever hated in life "".

I do go outaide with my friends for long walks and going around the hills and mountains around my town. I spend my days in discord talking to my friends and playing videogames trying to escape from the outside world. Ive been wanting to die for a year and a half maybe even more. I think life is beautiful and worth it, i think people should never do something that cant be undone but i dont think life is for me. I dont really wanna spend my days roaming around in the dark stumbling with no idea or direction on where to go. Death feels like the only option i have. I feel like im never going to get out of this hole ive madefor myself. Im so lost. Im so terrified of life, im scared of failing.

Everyday i get more paranoid about fucking nothing. Have you ever thought about this? You could have undiagnosed schizofrenia and you get your first episode. Your mum or girlfriend ( whatever ) hands you a knife to cut the carrots. You snap into a schizo episode and end up killing them.

There is a universe exactly like this one except for one event that doesnt follow the laws of nature. So basicaly one were you live your normal life but tomorrow your crush posts a naked pic of you, the whole world sees it. Everyone laughs at you. Or maybe theres a demon chasing you for no reason. Maybe youll be kidnapped and tortured. You can realistically be in this universe.

Im fucking lonely. Nobody likes me or ever will. My only “friends” use me for the little therapeutic things i know and now i have to know what to do when one of them tells me hes been dreaming about shooting up a school.

People only tell me im a good person because they either dont know me or have been taught to say it from society because its “polite”. Fuck you let me kill myself

I cant focus on anything, i used to do great at school but now im looking at dropping out. Not because im retarded but because I physically cannot keep my focus on the lesson. The teachers dont help me at all and just send me home as punishment. 

I have no interest in anything that could possibly ever give me a job. I only like destroying public property and making peoples ear bleed with nouse music. Im worthless and no one will miss me if i died

The reason im alive? Because my brother died 6 months after he was born. My parents didnt recover for years. I’d rather not think about what they’d do if i killed myself.

I never thought I'd make it to twenty.

I'd drink energy drink until my chest hurt because I read an article about a teenage boy taking a cardiac arrest after one too many. I started smoking at thirteen and forced the more people said it would kill me the more I smoked a day. I prayed every lump would be cancerous. I walked into the road without looking and my friends would scream at me because it scared them so bad. I'd stop eating until the empty pit in my stomach went numb. I'd punch the wall, a tree, the concrete until my hand was so swollen and bruised that the pain gave me something tangible to focus on and made the thoughts about bashing my own head in go for a few days.

Ever since then I haven't been able to sleep or eat or do anything so my friends suggested to go see a psychiatrist, which I did
After 2-3 session she gave me anti-depressants and pills to help me sleep but honestly they aren't of much help. All I want to do is take a lot of those sleeping pills and never wake up again cause my life is worse than a nightmare. I have all these people around me still I feel lonely.

SuicideWatch,"I'm 14
I have nothing that relies on me to live, what's the point of school, university, getting a job and starting a family, just a couple days ago I was excited to do all those things but now I don't see the point of it. it's just a waste of a life. I don't want to live long enough to see my loved ones die. I could say to myself ""I need to say alive or my family will be sad"" but realistically I know I would be dead so why would I care. I'm running out of things to distract me from this feeling of existential dread. I don't wanna distract myself with social media, I get horribly jealous when I see people doing better than me but I care too much about my online presence to delete social media. I can't stop thinking about all the things I'm missing out on in life but I know my anxiety would prevent me from doing those things anyway. I'm a fairly introverted person so I enjoy time to myself a lot but I have a longing to be a the cool popular person everyone likes, but I'm not willing to put any effort into becoming that person. 
My thoughts are becoming increasingly harder to ignore and I just want an answer as to why I should really bother doing anything, it all seems to be pointless but at the same time I care too much what other people think of me, so I continue on with my happy content persona. I know there's no such thing as one answer to solve all my problems but what I really want to find is a reason to keep on going, my life is so ultimately pointless. I would like just to not wake up one day, it's miserable, just a week ago I was looking forward to so many things but everything's lost it's meaning.

Honestly, I can't believe that some people out there have been together or married for 30-40 years. I can barely maintain a relationship for 1-2 months since I'm so scared of the other person hurting me, or of something bad happening to them. I feel like life is just a long, drawn-out process of anxiety, pain, and suffering. I just don't see the point of it.

I’m not one of them. 

Every day is harder than the last, the past 8 months I’ve been fighting to get my baby back. I used to actually see the baby before all this corona stuff but I haven’t held the baby for over 2 months. And it kills me. I see the baby over the phone but it’s not the same. 

I was told earlier this month that I’d be back with the baby by the end of the month but on Monday this week they said that was no longer happening. 

This baby was supposed to be a new start for me, the baby didn’t come under the usual love and partnership way. The baby came from failed birth control and a guy taking advantage. But this baby was everything to me. I love the baby so much. 

But I don’t feel like the baby’s mother anymore. 

Every time I look at the baby it hurts everything in my being because I just want to be the mother again. 

The baby went into foster care as I had postnatal psychosis and they assumed I wasn’t well enough to be a mother. The baby was never in danger of me but I wasn’t well. The baby is 11 months old. I’m very much better in lots of ways than I was then but I still don’t wanna be here. 

I don’t want to feel the pain of not having my child. I’ve missed so much of my baby growing that I don’t feel like a mother.

SuicideWatch,"This is a pretty dumb question, I admit. But I'm not sure what steps I should realistically take in my situation. 

For example, I'm not really in pain. People talk about how the folks who really commit suicide are in great pain. And I can't claim that. So full disclosure, I'm probably not a problem.

That said, I would like to know what I should do with myself. I find little value in my existence-- there really is no enjoyment from life. I'm having trouble understanding what I should do with my future / life, etc. What's the point? Folks often say ""there is no point. Just do what you think is good and right!"" But again, that holds no motivation for me. 

I guess I'll try to cut this short. What it sounds like I'm saying is that I don't really have a reason to die, but I wouldn't complain if I was dead. (for more than the obvious reason.) 

So, what should I do? Should I talk to someone? Just find some drugs? Is this what therapy is for? I can't really think that I'll have money to spend on such things. If that's the case, and life has no value or meaning, logically I should just check out, right?

SuicideWatch,"I’m 16. 

I don’t really expect anybody to read this. So many posts go unread but I just needed to vent.
Since I was 8 years old, I’ve been playing therapist for the people around me. I researched as much as I could to offer the help I could. I’ve called the police on friends who were considering suicide. 

When my sister passed away from cancer when I was eight years old, I pretended to be over it very early and tried to be there emotionally for my parents. Pretended to be happy for them. Worked hard in school because they value academics above everything else. Learned to cook so they wouldn’t worry when they were away at work. 

I’ve been depressed for a long time. I never got therapy for my sister’s passing, and once my mother told me that I never loved my sister because I was uncomfortable near her grave. She never apologized for that.

Im so tired. I’ve tried killing myself in the past. My friends saw the signs, but they didn’t reach out. They told me after wards when I recovered (physically) that they didn’t know what to do. But I saw them when another friend in our friend group had tried to kill themselves before me and they did whatever they could to reach out to them.

I feel so unimportant. I feel so fucking helpless. I feel like my only worth is helping others and smiling for others. My parents don’t care for me at all. They pretended to cry in the counselors office after my counselor called them to school after I told her I wanted to kill myself. Then they told me at home not to waste their time ever again. 

There is so much more but I don’t want to waste anyone’s time anymore. I figured I might as well end it. As scared as I am of dying, I just can’t do it anymore. I’m so tired","I know I’m young, but I’m tired of living already",t3_goelxe,1

My problem is this: any time that I talk about my depression to them I can see the pain in their faces. I attempted suicide last year and I'm constantly reminded of the fear and sadness that hangs over my family. My little brother and sister have both told my mom that they're depressed now too.

It's my fault for that already, but no matter what I do I can't stop hurting them. I can't support myself but I don't want to live off of them. I can't kill myself because that would destroy them.

SuicideWatch,"Every day I wake up and hope my mind will be well enough to let me function that day. Usually it's a bad day and my mind runs amok, thinking, planning and preparing mentally for what is to come. I am not just depressed, I have lost all hope and daily think of suicide. 


I have suffered from depression on and off for 22 years and I have had 3 major depressions throughtout this time. This last one has been going on for more than 2 years now. I see a doctor, I see a therapist, I take my medication regularly yet it makes no difference. I have never been keen on medication but I had to give into to it as a last resort for help. Yet all this doesn't help me move out of my depression. I feel like my life is worthless. I am useless, a failure and I wish my mother never gave birth to me.


I have tried every trick in the book aside from treatment to help me out of this. Hobbies, being with friends, keeping pets, volunteer work, trips and even tried exercise. They all offer a temporary fix but then do nothing further. I'll feel better for 5 minutes and then that feeling would be gone. I don't think I am resilient anymore to bounce back from this. I have no strength left to pick myself up and keep trying. 


Suicide has been on my mind a lot as the optimal solution. I have attempted suicide before 3 times. I was hospitalised all 3 times and involuntary committed twice. The last attempt had me in hospital for 10 days due serious injuries. This experience unfortunately has given me knowledge on what works and what doesn't work so well when attempting to kill myself. I used to have elaborate plans on how commit suicide but I have now realised there is no need to be elaborate. So I have come up with an effective way of killing myself with a back up plan in place to immediately implement if plan A fails.


I don't care about the people I leave behind. I don't care about what in life I may miss. I don't care about the aftermath. All I care about is when I will be able to successfully carry out my plan.

SuicideWatch,"I have recently just failed and have to take summer school. I haven't done my work in about 4 months because of I'm fucking suicidal. There are so many calls and emails that I think whenever I get a call or my mother checks her phone I get so much anxiety and my stomach begins to turn. My mom and siblings are telling me that I'm gonna flunk if I don't do my schoolwork, but I just don't even know if it's worth doing at this point. I'm a failure in their eyes and it's true. I've bottled up my emotions for so long and I feel like I'm gonna burst at any moment- But I don't. I just hold back my tears and sob. My mother's car was literally hit when she was about to tell my school about homeschooling and she had to fight thick and thin for that. I feel so guilty.

I get angry at my two oldest siblings. My sister - who's also depressed - always bothers everyone with her ""intrusive thoughts"" and it gets on my fucking nerves. It even makes me cringe at myself and feel pathetic because she's used those words so much it kills me inside (wish she could do it on the outside too). Yet, she always wants to vent when I'm around for advice, and says ""you wouldn't understand"" in a soft voice that annoys the ever loving shit out of me. And when I vent to her she says ""things will get better"" and ""you'll be fine"" so cocky-like and it makes me wonder if she's actually faking it sometimes. She's such a loud mouth and I low-key hate her for it. 

My oldest brother, however, pisses me off in so many ways. Usually he's harmless, but whenever he's angry, he uses my disabilities (epilepsy, cerebral palsy) as an excuse to get me to do things for him. And when I say no, he gets angry and there's two possibilities: One; he complains about how I don't contribute to society and leaves. Two; he hits me. I always get upset when he does either of them. 

They're not the only factors. Everyone who looks at me thinks I'm hideous and doesn't want anything to do with me other to make fun of me. At class people would move their chairs away from me. When we couldn't pick who we got to sit with and I was chosen with someone/people, other classmates would complain about me being around. The only friends I have are online, and even then I barely get any chance to talk to them because unlike me they actually have lives. It's gotten so bad to the point where I just talk to myself. I even imagined an imaginary (boy)friend named Alexander who is basically all of my bad sides put together into one. I imagine him touching me, kissing me, all those other things because I know I'm not gonna make myself suffer that long to experience that.

I bang my head on walls and doors to bring myself into a coma so I won't have to face the consequences and possibly kill myself. I'm a horrible person yet everyone in my family see's me as an angel. I have so many skeletons in my closet it's unreal. I wish I could tell people irl about this but I don't like making people upset and my anxiety likes to fuck with me when I try.

I'm on a medication that if I go cold turkey on, I'll have a seizure and I think that'll be my out if I decide to do it. I live alone and I just want to get blackout drunk every night until I have a seizure and hopefully choke on my own vomit and die.

I'm done, no more doctors, no more medicine, no more blowing up my life when I get depressed. I'm just going to shove it down and fake it until I die.

I don't want to die, but I can't do this anymore. I'm so exhausted.","I'm done, I'm tired of fighting.",t3_gomvip,1

SuicideWatch,"So, about 2 weeks ago I attempted suicide but, before even realising that I was really to do it (not like I had a proper plan) I posted in a private exercise facebook club that I was to quit of EVERYTHING. Literally, f\*\*\* it I quit, nothing makes sense, I quit of everything!This was 1 day before a fitness chock plan. To my surprise instead of having people pity me or, asking how I was?, if I need help? or, even ""ok see you next time you are a free person"", instead had people told me things like: deep breath you can do this, one more day; don't quit you almost there; Don't be a drama queen you did it until here. I, answered to this reactions in a rude belligerent way saying people to stfu, because I was about to cut my wrists so I had no energy to continue in the stupid programme and, if they didn't wanted to know this fucked up information they shouldn't have had pressed me. After this people started answering people started playing the victim saying that they never seen such reaction in the group, that they don't have to deal with rude people, that if I don't want help then I shouldn't post things. There was laugh and emojis to the fact a PhD is a though time. My post was then removed by moderators

While I understand their hurt reaction and, that was not the place to ask for help, do they even realised that I was not joking? Yes, I was asking for attention, YES I was in a bad place! I literally swallowed enough pills to kill a person with 3x times my weight the next day. Unfortunately, my stomach couldn't handle it so I trew up after 3 hours. The worse is that they are all adults? Not teens, unknowing of the world, the coach/mod inclusively has been in a rough place too.

Seriously how do I process this? In one side I want to apologise for my cry of attention and rudeness but, I the same time I'm very, very hurt. I want to go, meet this people IRL (I can't nor I will) because right when I was asking for help, understanding, something positive (maybe in the wrong place in the wrong way) I was ridiculed and downplayed but the worst, they played the victim card!?Well part of me understands that they felt victim because, they kicked and hornet's nest when they told me to continue the programme when I said I was to quit EVERYTHING and, I bite, I can be f nasty  if ppl boss me but, really I didn't even called anyone any name so, really? REALLY?! Are you really the victim?I'm foaming while I write this ... How do I process this? HOW? Is it even worth to try to speak to any of them or will it just be other egocentric call of attention from my side?

I attempted, I failed and, I feel very embarrassed of my failure and also I've a ""voice"" saying ""well you didn't plan it properly, you knew the right dose but, of course you should have taken it slower than that. You did it as excuse to not need to work, so that people pity you. It was just other call of attention, nothing else. You can't do it! You are too weak to end your own suffering. Egocentric, maniac fucking pussy"". I still very suicidal but, I don't have how to do it safely

Note: After this post and its removal I contacted a suicidal help line (chat) and, things were not much better though the person was kind, it came with the cliche things as usually.  ""I see you are in pain but, you made it until now""; ""It gets better""; ""keep fighting, don't quit"" and finally ""talk to your doctor"".

SuicideWatch,"Been doing a lot of thinking lately. It’s all pointless. Living is more irrational than killing yourself. It’s not a Permanent solution to a Temporary problem. Life is invariably occupied with different degrees of suffering. It all inevitably leads to death anyway. How is it rational to continue to suffer out of spite? There’s no way that it can actually be rational to continue to experience suffering when there’s a way out. I hate it. I truly despise it. Months ago I had a feeling that there was purpose and goodness to be had. But now I know it’s all a sham.

I’m giving myself 24 hours to stay around. Try my best to enjoy myself. Smoke cigarettes. Send loving texts to friends. Make the day as painless as is possible. That’s the way to go. I’ve posted here so many times and I haven’t even got a clue why. Nobody can help me really. I’m a lost cause.

SuicideWatch,"I write this with a heavy heart and I never thought I would be in a place like this. 

My mother and father moved away to a different city on my 18th birthday and pretty much told me to come or fend for myself. I was tied down in uni at the time but I had to quit due to now having a financial crisis of having to live alone. 

I found somewhere to live and lived check by check. It was hard not to be mad at them and I cried most nights having them leave me so young and out of nowhere. I felt betrayed and rejected. My mum told me to get over it and that she was looking forward to leaving me behind. This is after I begged them to come back. 

I lived through the rest of last year struggling but surviving. This year however I have been smashed by my emotions and more conflict with my mother in particular.

She has told me things like, ""you've been dealt shit cards in life so just accept it"" and ""I can't live with you anymore, I need to live my own life"". My father has also blown up at me and has told me things like he doesn't want to be my father anymore as he doesn't have the time and that I shouldn't bother inviting him to my wedding (whenever that happens) because he doesn't want to be there. My parents both are diagnosed with serious mental health conditions.

At this point in life everyone in my family has left me. My siblings don't speak or interact with me and my parents only care about themselves. When I ask for help they laugh and tell me that I'm an adult so I need to deal with it. 

I'm only just 20 years old.

The pain of all this abandonment makes me feel like my own parents and family don't care for me. No one checks in on me even though im living all alone. It feels like if I end it no one will even notice. They never normally do.

things would be better once im gone. i bring nothing but disappointment to my family, and to the handful of friends i have, i barely talk to them especially about things like this so it wouldn’t matter whether or not im here. i can’t attempt suicide in my country because i can get in trouble again if i were to survive it. i will be going overseas for university, and that’s when i plan to take my own life and this pandemic has done nothing but push my plans further away. but im reaching a point where i really can’t find it in me to care where i do it. i thought i would get better but i’m just going back to square one again. i really don’t know what to do anymore because i don’t want to be here but i’m still here because of my mom i don’t want to leave her.

So I come to reddit and try to get involved in body positive subs n get compliments n feel better, it kind of works... but there are still SO MANY FUCKING girls on here with implants who are getting thousands of likes on their naked bodies while my ugly body that for whatever reason I decided to share is road kill beside their perfect and expensive tits.

No. They’re just fucking small. Barely even breasts at all. And every single one of you fuckers here would rather have more than a handful and I know that, and I just can’t fucking live with it all anymore god fucking damn.

SuicideWatch,"I hate myself so fucking much I could literally end the world with no remorse. 

Funny thing is, I'm only 17 and about to be a Junior soon.
When I was 8 years old, my biological father left my mother and me and my sister. Since then shit has gone through the roof.
We were a happy family and I looked up to my dad as a hero and wanted guidance and love from him.
At 13 my mother told me everything about him.
I often viewed him as a very caring person and the best father I've ever had.
But now I view him as a deadbeat good-for-nothing lying piece of shit who doesn't deserve to be called my dad.
He abused my mother often when they argued and he'd cheat on her behind her back.
I was so young I obviously didn't know what was going on.

One night my mother and father argued because she caught him cheating and told him to leave and pack his shit.
And so he did leave, to my country, the Philippines.
I used to talk to him on FaceBook a lot because I really loved and miss him.
Then I blocked him as soon as I heard about him.
Currently as I'm writing this, he has 3 children and cheated on many women.
When I learned about this it felt like he left because he probably thought that I wasn't good enough.
He always took me to the ball park to shoot some ball and I aspired to be a basketball player but then that dream drifted away since I want to pursue my career has a musician.
I felt like basketball was more of his thing than mine.
I'm not even physically or mentally strength anymore, I've lost motivation in life and don't wanna leave my room.
It feels weird writing this because I normally just cry it out but I felt like I had to since I had stumbled upon this page.

I had to cope with life by playing video games, which led to my Insomnia which also lead to my anxiety.
Before, I couldn't sleep very well and I'd always sleep around 4 or 5 possibly 6 in the morning staring dead at the wall, always thinking about negative things.
I've always thought about many different ways I could leave this world and I've contemplated suicide but I'm afraid of it.
I can't think positively because negativity is always in my mind.
Problems pile up and pile up like files of work.
I don't eat much and I don't go outside anymore.
Nobody in my family asks me about how I feel, so I often think that they don't care at all either.
My mother always wants my care and support when I've always given it but never gives any back.

School is another big problem of my life.
Sometimes it's the teachers but most of the time it's the students that are a burden.
My school is filled with a bunch of idiots who don't know any better but act like they're hard and cool.
I barely have any friends, only two and the both of them aren't cool with each other anymore.
I have a third friend, my bestest one but he goes to another school that's better than mines.
I always try to talk out my problems to my friends because I need someone to talk to but I feel like most of the time they don't care or get it at all.
They'll joke around and laugh sometimes.
It hurts especially when they're friends since elementary.
Before them I had childhood friends that I now lost.
One of them I can't keep contact with because his whereabouts are unknown.
One of them don't talk to me anymore.
And the last one I fucked up the friendship because I stole from him.

Oh yeah, another reason of my self-hatred.
My wrongs.
I regret what I've done in the past because I was such a thief and a liar.
I've stolen from friends and convenience stores, even my school.
I messed up so many friendships and trusts that I could barely even look at myself in the mirror.


Life is throwing more problems at me, like this whole quarantine bullshit.

I'd been playing video games with my friends on Wednesday night and heard her snoring thinking nothing of it. When I went to the bathroom I realised she was in there and had taken a load of pills and vodka. I called an ambulance straight away and they took her to hospital. Cause of coronavirus I couldnt even fucking go which I understand but it was horrible having to just phone every couple hours to find out what's going on. I slept like 9 hours the past 3 days. My mum and sister stayed on a video call with me for like a day and a half just so I didnt feel so isolated. I'm fortunate to have a great family and friend group who were all willing to talk, just unfortunate that they're all at least 100 miles away.

Thankfully she recovered enough that they discharged her this morning so I picked her up. I've been getting her fluids and getting her to eat a little bit here and there. As I write, she's asleep next to me.

In truth, I'm scared. I know BPD has a massive likelihood of suicide attempts, and now this has happened I'm so scared it'll happen again. We're heading home to stay with my family and get her some psychiatric(?) support and soon as she's feeling up to it.

I think I just posted this looking for a little support or any advice on how to care for her just now. I've run through this scenario in my head many times and now that it's happened I'm just shell shocked. I think I'll be personally looking for therapy too as it's been beneficial in the past.

I’m averaging 10-22 suicidal thoughts a day. And yes, I have counted it. 1-3 depressive episodes a day. And I’m basically empty and broken. 

One time I told my parents why they gave birth to me, they laughed and said, “Why would you ask that? ArE yOu SuIciDaL?”, they sarcastically questioned me, and I had no other choice but to stay silent. 

I had no emotional support in my entire childhood. I was by myself, getting bullied every single day. And when I tell that to my parents, they say, “What did you do this time?? You’re supposed to be friends with them!!”.

I’m always wrong, and they are always right. Whenever I got trouble from school, I have to make myself the devil for my classmates.

I'm at a point where I can't tell what I mean and what I don't mean, and what's actual empathy, and what's just me mimicking empathy.

My relationship ended a little while ago. I sort of expected it-- our religions are, like, polar opposites, and I weaponize mine for narcissism. Still, it hurt. She opened up to me about how I was just holding her emotionally hostage the whole time, which sucks for me, cuz I thought she was just into me. Then I found out that I have NPD and it's like? My whole life just kinda shattered. Which is a bummer, to say the least. I've been slowly cutting people out of my life even before I found out about the NPD, so this kind of sheds light on everything. I pushed everyone else out cuz fuck that, I'm not into hurting people.

I feel like I have no way of attaining the self-awareness to discern what is and isn't real, and even writing this, I can't tell if I'm doing it because I want help or I just wanna manipulate people into giving me pity.

I'm truly out of things to live for. The only thing keeping me around is birds. There's a lot of robins and mourning doves near my house. But the way I figure it, I can't be mad about missing things before I was born. Why should I be mad about missing things after I die?

I'd rather face death than face a life with no friends, no wife, and no hope. Just ten hour shifts until I kick the bucket.

SuicideWatch,"Hey, this is a little generic. I just need some kind words and advice from strangers.

My [20M] girlfriend [18F] of 2-3 months, whom I love extremely much, is on her way across the country to spend a weekend with me. She called me this morning and we had a huge fight, I fucked up and now there's a very break-up feeling vibe in the relationship. She called me saying that she doesn't know if she wants to do this anymore, and that she's not feeling that she is in love with me anymore.

I know 2-3 months sound like very little, and probably my love for her wouldn't be that great. But I have mental issues, and I get attached way too fast. I have raging anxiety and I can't stop being afraid of her leaving me, and since it's long distance that's really hard to deal with.

This girl is almost the perfect embodiment of my ideal girl. She is amazingly pretty, funny, smart, good in bed and just generally awesome to be around. We never fight when we're with each other physically, only when texting or calling, and its usually misunderstandings that initiate the flights.

Anyways, shell be here soon and I'm pretty sure this is the weekend I say goodbye. Last time this happened, I broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years and almost ended myself with a load of pills just weeks after. I couldn't take the anxiety of her moving on so quickly, and this girl is DEFINITELY gonna move on even quicker, due to the short time of the relationship and her amazing looks and personality.

I can barely take the anxiety right now, the suicidal thoughts have already started. I wanna jump in front of her train when she arrives, I wanna hang myself before I see her, I just don't wanna face what's coming. Even if this is for the better and I'm better off without her, I'm afraid that I can never love anybody enough to trust them and not start shit because I'm anxious.

my best friend uses substances frequently, he knows hes a junkie and thinks he cant change, doesnt think hes worth coming to for help because he cant help himself. he doesnt believe that he is worth anything because he’s been addicted to drugs for years and years. 

he still goes to work etc and recently moved states so i cant physically be there for him.

the thing is now joes younger brother is coming to my best friend for help, and told him he was doing meth. and my best friend has no idea how to help him as he was using it for a while at one stage and doesn’t want to be a hypocrite by telling him to not do it etc because he feels like he isn’t in the position to do so because he’s still a junkie.

my best friend doesn’t feel like he can be a good older brother to joe as joe does not know about his substance abuse nor does he know about his multiple inpatient treatments at rehabs / mental wards etc(  he is also bipolar ). he’s currently off his head and is extremely suicidal, he doesn’t know what to do or say. he never opens up this deep and i’m worried because i’ve known him for a decade, he is like a brother to me. and i want to be there for him, the way he has always been there for me.

he wont listen to me when i say he should think about admitting himself into rehab or a mental ward- i only say this as his drug use is starting to get out of hand. but i can understand perfectly why he wouldn’t want to go and that is his choice. but i’m clueless as to how i can be there for him. 

i would be grateful for any advice given. thank you for reading this far if you did.",how can i help someone who lost a loved one to suicide? any advice is appreciated,t3_gofwt5,1

SuicideWatch,"I guess I should start with, the reason for tonight was a giant argument with my husband. It was over stupid shit but it escalated. 
I’ve been struggling to not kill myself for the past two years, I’ve tried getting help before it’s gotten as bad as my last attempt and was just met with so much hostility, told to “shove it all back in a box” since that was how I had “cured myself” last time by the military crisis Behaviroal Health person. 
I made a promise that last attempt I had in 2018, that I wouldn’t because of my daughter but it’s a ducking struggle.
I had a bad breakdown earlier this year and the only thing that stopped me was sitting in a circle of pictures of my children, to remember my promise but I’m so fucking tired. 
I have so many painkillers, sleep medications, muscle relaxers, and medications  to physiologically slow my heart rate to help with anxiety and tonight I know how I’m going to do it.

I’m going to wait for everyone to fall asleep and then just take all of these at once. It shouldn’t hurt right? Just make me go to sleep and not wake up? 

I’m trying to find reasons to stay alive but it’s hard. I’m so tired of just being a fuck up and a waste of space. I feel like my husband doesn’t understand me and that he would be happier or better off if I wasn’t in the picture. I love my children but I just feel like a bad mom all the time because I know I need more patience and I get frustrated (I don’t hurt them or anything so it’s nothing like that) I mean moms are supposed to be this never ending well of patience and I just don’t have all of that.
My family is shit, except for my younger brother but I feel like they would be the only one that cared. My kids are probably too young (I know my son is for sure) to even really be affected by this in life right? I just...I don’t know what to do.
I feel like I’m punished whenever I try to seek help and even then they’re just condescending and tired because I’m not walking in with my wrists slit.

Some meds even made it way worse, to the point I seriously considered killing myself. I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, panic attacks and of course insomnia. My family thinks I'm faking it. I don't have any friends at all and therefore no support system. I can't even make my own appointments because I'm too scared to talk on the phone (talking in person is much worse though).

SuicideWatch,"(I apologize for cursing.)

I’m not even exactly sure what went wrong. This was supposed to be the best year of my life.

My life hasn’t always been the best, but late 2019 was the change I’ve been waiting for. My favorite band got back together. I met someone I immediately fell for. I met some amazing friends. 2020 was smooth sailing, I was so unbelievably happy. 

I remember thinking to myself “I really don’t deserve this, but this is as good as it’s going to get. I am SO happy. I can’t believe it.” 

I didn’t wake up and immediately want to die anymore. Suicide didn’t cross my mind. I smiled all the time. I wasn’t in physical pain anymore. I was falling in love, which is something I’ve never experienced. I was so fucking happy. 

2 months ago was my change. I’m chronically ill and something happened to me physically. Over these past two months, I’m back to being in constant pain. Constantly feeling sick. I started changing again, back into the shell of a person I used to be. 

My mental health rapidly deteriorated. I wasn’t ME anymore. My friends noticed it. I started ignoring them over time, not being able to do anything. 

Worst of all? I think the person I love has lost all feelings for me. I care for them more than anything and they can’t even talk to me. 

A few days ago I broke. I’ll admit it. And it only got worse. 

I was going to kill myself. Yesterday. Wanted to more than anything. 

I left my friend’s group chat because they were talking and so happy and I wanted them to stay that way. Perfect and happy. 

It’s just my best friend and the person I love. 

They knew something was wrong immediately but I couldn’t respond to them. How the fuck am I supposed to tell my favorite people that I want to fucking die? How? 

I ignored their messages for close to 40 minutes. They texted me, messaged me on multiple social media platforms and I just couldn’t respond. I wanted to, trust me, but I just couldn’t stop sobbing. My life is a complete waste. I am nothing. I can’t live like that anymore. 

I eventually responded to the person I love because they didn’t deserve to worry like that. I told them what was happening. 

They were so fucking worried, they just kept saying “emptyandnumb, please talk to me. please.” and I couldn’t do anything but cry and apologize. I don’t deserve them. 

Since then, they haven’t talked to me. They’re actively ignoring me and I don’t blame them. It was fucking traumatizing and it was completely my fault. I want to talk to them so, so, so badly. I want nothing more than that, but they just won’t. 

If I die, they will have a much better life. I just know it. I want to die for incredibly selfish reasons as well, but I want to give them a chance at something better without me being a burden to them. They don’t know I love them. They don’t know.

I just want them to be okay. 

And I want to stop existing. I want the pain to go away. 

I’m thinking about death nonstop now. There isn’t a moment where I’m not thinking about it. 

I can’t stop crying. I can’t eat, I can’t drink, I can’t sleep. I don’t leave my bed.

I’m so fucking terrified. Everything is so scary. It’s not as scary if I close my eyes, but it still fucking hurts. 

I think about how my past self would be so disappointed in their current self. I’m a disappointment. I’m nothing.

I want help. Don’t get me wrong. I can’t find a therapist during this pandemic, there are no inpatient mental health services in my city or close to me, suicide hotlines have been busy when I try them, I currently don’t have a general doctor as my last one retired. 

I’m stuck. I have no one and nothing. I have no resources. 

I can’t do anything but suffer alone and pray that I can close my eyes and never wake up. 

I feel like I can’t breathe. I can’t stop shaking. Everything is so dark and so loud. 

Even when I’m asking for help, my friends just don’t listen. It’s like I’m underwater and I’m trying to scream for help, but no one can hear me. It’s a nightmare I can’t ever wake up from or escape. I can’t properly explain what I’m going through and everyone thinks I’m perfectly okay, but I’m in misery.

SuicideWatch,"I have been struggling with physical illness for so long, there is literally always something wrong.  On top of that I have bipolar disorder and nothing fucking works for it.  I attempted suicide when I was 12.  I got scared and went to the hospital—couldn’t go through with it.  I’ve been having some very strange spells lately, like TIAs, but my husband is an alcoholic and he didn’t believe me or care I guess.  It’s really fucked up the way I think.  It’s like one minute I’m fine and the next I have no idea where I am or what’s going on.  I think they’ve caused major brain damage because I have no control over my emotions.  I’ve just had enough and I don’t want my kids to see me like this.  My husband left me yesterday, after drinking for months, not helping with the mortgage, forgetting to pay the HOA fees.  I found out today that I’m very far behind, I have no money, I’m going to lose my house, and more than likely my kids.  I’ve struggled with ptsd my whole life and I’ve been beaten, tortured, raped, kidnapped, sexually humiliated, my brother was so mean to me when I was a child and literally beat the shit out of me on an almost daily basis.  All of this finally really just got to me today.  I thought about it.  I know it’s selfish, but I’ve had so much emotional and physical pain that I feel like I truly just can’t do it anymore.  So, I just took a bunch of fucking drugs—I have a small pharmacy, wrote a note to my kids apologizing and I honestly think they’ll understand.  They know how physically and mentally ill I am.  So, it’s been done and I’m expecting all the propranolol alone will be enough to stop my heart, and if not I’ve got a bottle of vodka downstairs.  It’s no one’s fault.  It just is what it is.  I’ve had a lot of neurological issues too in the last four years and can’t even ride a bike, walk very far, and I’m always shaking.  It’s really weird, but no one can figure it out.  This is like a mercy suicide, I’m sad but not that sad.  I just can’t deal with the shit anymore.  I know some of you will get it and thank you because this was not an easy decision.  I simply can’t anymore.  Personality changes and constant ups and downs and weird fugue like states.  It’s scary and I’d rather die with my family remembering me for who I am now than to be totally unrecognizable to them, or worse, not even know who they are.  I’m sorry for all of you who are experiencing similar issues.  It’s not fair and there’s nothing that can be done.  I forgive you if you can’t do it anymore and I hope you can forgive me.  I hope everyone can.  Enough is enough, you know what I mean?  And then to lose the one person who could have helped but he had wet brain.  I think my kids deserve a normal childhood and they’re never going to have that with me.  It’s bipolar, of course, that’s not helping...but that’s really too simplistic because there’s so much more.  I’m sorry.   To all of you.  And if I have to, I guess I’ll just keep going until I find something that does work.  Good luck to you all.  I get it and I don’t think you’re weak at all.  It’s a sense of tiredness that I can’t begin to explain.  Just tired of all of it.

Edit: Starting to get tired thank God.  My husband came home and was an ass, saw the note I wrote and just left anyway.  And then told me he’s taking the dog from my kids and he’s already taken the cat.  His name is Damon Owens.  He lives in Iowa.  He’s a piece of work.

I feel constantly torn up about my social anxiety. I want friends, i want more friends.

SuicideWatch,"Hi I am new to this thread.  I identify with what some people in other threads have been calling passively suicidal. I have made one slightly serious attempt. Less so now, but very much so not long ago. I have problems that I wanted help with. 
Specifically: 
loss, post-partum depression from an abortion, sexual abuse, depression, hatred towards family members and v low self esteem and self loathing. 

A few years ago (when I lost a friend that committed suicide) I made some progress with a therapist. 
BUT THEN...

I went to a university therapist in December 2019. It was the first time I was seeing her. I had a bad feeling from the beginning but shared that I do self harm for dealing with anxiety and that I was passively suicidal. Long story short, she had me committed to a psychiatric ward which was one of the most traumatizing experience of my life. 

I did not know that she had the power to do this. I did not know that I would not be allowed to leave the facility. She made it sound like I was going to a more professional therapist to get an evaluation. She dropped me off at a hospital facility with a cab and she said that she would wait for me and would bring me back to school and that it wouldn't take long. Once I was inside, the staff asked me to sign this paper work. I said I don't know what this is and that I want to leave only to find out a) that by entering the facility I had no right to leave b) that the school therapist had already left.

By getting help I was essentially going to a prison. I had no choice but to sign the paper work. I was in the hospital for 12 hours before I was transferred to another facility and I was there for a week. The facility (a psychiatric ward) was horrific (stool stains, loud, smelly, hardly clean, I was groped by a nurse when having my daily vitals taken.) At no point do you see a therapist. The days felt like years. I learned from other 'patients' (some of which were in similar situations to myself, in these institutions against their will and brought there under false pretenses) that there were other floors of 'more severe patients'. My heart goes out to these people because there is no way they are getting the help they need in these shit hole places. 

I was eventually discharged. I graduated. I moved away, but I have SO MUCH rage and anger about this whole situation. I have developed sleeping problems. I have fantasize where I torture the therapist that lied to me. And: (spoiler alert) I am more suicidal than before.

The only constant is that I want help but I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO GET IT. I never ever want to be recommitted. I am so deeply afraid of talking to a therapist even the thought of it paralyzes my whole body and I feel like I might throw up. I have some friends but I feel like a burden when I talk too much about it and am afraid of sharing other issues I have. I absolutely can not talk to my family about it, they recently went so far as to make fun of me for being committed to a psychiatric ward (in addition to preexisting problems with them). 

....so I'm having a go at Reddit.

Final thoughts:
I am not religious or spiritual and have no desire to be. Please keep your beliefs to yourself and respect mine. 

I recognize that having acess to health care and a university therapist is a privilege, but I did not want to be committed to a psychiatric ward.

I have made complaints through official channels about my experience with that therapist and at the psychiatric ward. I foresee no structural change to occur as a result.

How long have i been suicidal? Depends. When i was in 6th grade my dad died from lymphoma cancer and that was very... strange. I was the only one telling my whole family to cheer up. Now that I’m 25 it’s been hurting so bad for almost 8 years already . I can’t take it everyone’s stressed everyone’s just trying to live normally (present)

Needless to say, my mother got into drugs(past), living on the streets as on of those you would call “dope heads” (god i hate saying this) now she’s back and she’s doing better but you can tell it’s affected her and there’s times we’re she’s just not herself. I take real xanny bars on the daily and they’re getting expensive and I’m currently tapering off safely but . I just feel like life’s going no where. I sit in my room watch stuff and just dream of being there or havi that feeeling. About 6 years ago i had a job making 800 a week at 19 years old but it was dangerous and i was with a girl who was beautiful but we both were just getting Into our first relation ship and well at first it’s so fucking beautiful. The Christmas lights the family gatherings the everything. The warm feeling in your heart going home from her home. 

Her dad died too. I was with her the whole time from start to finish .. and it was just like my dad. Big strong, down to a pulp . 

I feel like shinichi from parasyte, no heart no brain . Just cold. I don’t care anymore. 
And there’s times i go crazy and want to just die somehow. And i know if i take a crazy amount of percys or oxys or fent that i will just lull asleep because I’m terrified of falling off something or hanging like no lol wtf no. I just wanna sleep forever and leave a thank you note to my mom and Iil bro but i know i won’t but it’s like. 

Ugh

I can’t ever talk to my mom or bro because they just look at me as a dope head because I’m always asleep or yeah. Off bars. I was a living nightmare when my mom was off dope because I’m not stupid i found empty lighters in corners everywhere in like sketchy areas around the house . I would go to her bathroom and knock then bang just cause i want to see how she is. And maybe if she’s okay say gooodnight that’s IT. But then i go nuts and break shit. That’s all behind us but there’s a huge hole that will never be filled. Ever. If you’ve gotten this far, go huh your dad. He works harder then you can imagine. I don’t know how he got us to Vegas so many times and had three houses and worked asss a boss and managed two auto shops. I’ll never will be able to ask him about anything and when i ask my mom about a story i weep so hard. I drink a lot and i take Xanax to make it stronger . I’m tapering off but man i think it’s the alcohol now that I’m like getting the shakes from . I just want to work. Come back with rent money and sleep. That’s all we’re worth.

Again probably makes no sense but I think it’s just gotten to the point where I can’t feasibly see myself sticking around much longer, it’s almost like I wasn’t supposedly to make it this far in life to begin with and I guess at some point or another I subconsciously just excepted that someday I would die.

I think it’s probably gotten worse lately because I’ve reached an age that I never thought I would live to, and now I guess it’s “triggering” me I guess (hope that’s the right word)

Why live, when you can only eat what is absolutely necessary to survive, when there is no path towards a better situation in sight?

Why live, when life takes so much, yet rewards so little?

Why live, when the companionship of others is unsustainable or impossible under the emotionally crushing pressures to get by, to just make it through another day?

Weakness is always a burden, no matter the circumstance. 

I can't be strong. I cannot be consistently strong for others, let alone for myself. 

I feel so tired. Overcoming the fear of death seems easier than trying to find happiness in a futile life.

I cannot be a friend, for to truly be a friend requires resilient strength. I try to at the very least be good to the people I love and to the people around me, but that alone seems to mean so little in the struggle for independent security. 

For a person to have to try to carry his own weight, but to also have to develop himself into something of use to society, to have to strive constantly to prove himself. To have to engage himself mentally at all times without reprieve, unable to afford frivulous and hedonistic distraction.

To have to decide the meaning of his struggle, to assign it worth. Even more difficult, to remember that meaning and have the presence of mind to never forget it at all times, because one cannot afford to become unmotivated, which is the direct consequence of continuing anyways.

Well when I asked him, he made me promise I wouldn't judge him, and he basically said that two years ago, a good friend of mine he paid for her nudes, which she did, but then later he also paid for something not sex related, it was like an art piece, and well, she didn't deliver, so he got mad and pressured her for more nudes. She blocked him, and he realized what he did, and he felt like shit for it. And he used that as motivation to become a better man.

Well, I'm friends with the girl, and I asked her if it was true, she said yes but that he forgot the detail with just WHAT he said that caused her to block him.

So I got mad that he lied and blocked him, well he still followed me on Instagram, I told him the reason why I blocked him. And he maintained he was telling the truth and that he wouldn't lie about something that made him look like a shitbag.

Well....I still blocked him.

Worst the friend I told started trash talking him, and a lot of their mutual friends blocked him.

But then a week later, I found out he had killed himself. His suicide note was basically a list of regrets and how no matter what he did it wouldn't make up for his sins of the past.

He didn't list who he wronged....all he did was talk about how there was no forgiveness for what he did.

SuicideWatch,"I come from an extremely abusive family. My biological dad was abusive and so is my stepdad. He has hurt my family so many times including my little siblings. Anytime he start something I always get into it so that he can direct his violence at me so I can protect my mother and siblings. It has led to me being kicked out of the house when I cracked a rib. He made a deal that I would leave the house or he will press charges. And since I couldn’t protect my family from jail I took the deal. It was in self-defense but my family is so terrified of him they would have spoken out against me. I just found out thatMy mother has been filing divorce and restraining orders behind his back and the other day with the county sheriff serve them to him and got him kicked out of the house. I’ve never felt a sigh relief like I did the other day.  I’ve always contemplated suicide because I want to escape my problems, but I didn’t want to do it because I didn’t wanna leave my family alone to deal with him. This led to me over eating and developing a large weight problem. After I found all this out for the first time it’s like I instantly did not crave anything sweet. I even went exercising today and I just felt like a huge grind stone has been lifted off my shoulders. This is kind of my way of saying I don’t think I need to be on suicide watch anymore.

SuicideWatch,"I used to have suicidal thoughts all the time. 

There have been several times in wich I almost attempted, like in early January when I almost drank about .5L of H2O2. 

The closest I've ever gotten to actually dying (or at least it felt like the closest) was when I tried to choke myself with a scarf on the 22nd of January. 
In the end I panicked when I started not being able  to see and freed myself.

A while after  that I started feeling like my ""suicidality"" (not a word, I think) was gone.



Then I put scissors in the plug socket on the 20th of April hoping for death during a pretty awful crisis, and for the following weeks all of the suicidal thoughts were back.

SuicideWatch,"What I mean is, feeling like you don’t wanna go on but yet not actually attempting to kill yourself, making plans, anything like that. Because I feel like that sometimes.

I really don’t have motivation to do all that much the last few months. In college my first semester last fall I did not so great academically because I felt depressed. Second semester I did a bit better, but I feel no motivation to give it my 100%. In high school you get higher grades so you look better for colleges, but once you’re in college, what does it really matter as long as you pass and get your degree?

Even if I get a degree, I still don’t know if I would have the motivation to work. I sure do not right now. I’ve never had an actual job, just worked for people in the family who’d pay me some cash at the end. And if I don’t feel like I will want to work, why am I going to college and letting my mom waste her money on me helping me get through?

The only things I enjoy really are playing video games and watching videos online. It’s because they distract me from the inevitable future. I don’t like to think about my future because I’m not sure if I even have one. I know that everyone pretty much has to work to live, but I just can’t get myself to want to. I feel like I’m going to reach that moment one day and be unable to continue. And at that point I really will kill myself. 
As for why I don’t do it now, I guess it’s because I’m still able to keep distracting myself from that future.

Also, I have nothing to live for. I’ve never accomplished anything significant. I feel like a dead weight on my family and I contribute nothing to society. Why do I even bother anymore?

I can’t believe I can’t seem to do something everyone else can: literally just live a life. I don’t know why life seems so hard for me. And it’s not like I live a rough life. Mine is probably much better than most people have it. I feel so pathetic it’s not even funny.

SuicideWatch,"It's had 23 years to get better. I've been suicidal since I was 10 years old or so, and no, it's never gotten better. It's not going to.

I left a probably abusive marriage a couple of months ago, and I'm so sick of people acting like that should have fixed everything. It wasn't the relationship that made me suicidal—I've always been suicidal—so I'm still suicidal. It's not situational depression. It's just me. It's always been me. I'm not growing out of it. It's not circumstantial. It's not a phase. Out of the three decades I've been alive, I know I've been depressed for two of them, and I can't even say for sure that I wasn't depressed for longer. I'm not even sure that it's not something built into my personality, woven into the fabric of who I am.

My life is a disaster, but that's because I'm depressed. I'm not depressed because my life is a disaster. I still have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I lost my crappy job due to COVID, so I'm really not sure what I'm going to do.

Now that I've left my marriage, I honestly don't know what I have in life. I left my home country to get married, but don't have permanent residency in the country I'm living in. I have nowhere that I think is home and have no idea where I'm going to go.

My life is, and always has been, empty. I don't know who I am or what I like. I have no interests or hobbies, and moreover, I never have. I don't like anything and nothing makes me happy.

The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself yet is that I'm very sure I'd mess that up and end up with a hospital bill I can't pay and/or a damaged body. If I knew 100% that I would die, it wouldn't even warrant thinking about. I just want to die. I have nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to, no hope whatsoever. I just don't want to have to do this anymore.

We talked for 4 hours about what was going on with me and why I haven’t been doing any work for those classes at all. I finally told them that I’ve been depressed since I was 10 and that that was also the first time I tried to kill myself. My dad didn’t say anything, but my mom basically told me that I’m an attention whore and that all I do is manipulate people. She said she’s very embarrassed and disappointed in me. She started saying that she also said ants to make an appointment with a genealogist to check to see if I was still a virgin or not because she didn’t trust me. She basically started calling me a slut. I don’t why she brought up that topic. She also said that once I turned 18 that I was out the house and that she would never come visit me for nothing. She would be free to do whatever she wants and would be way happier without me in the house. Constantly being compared to my skinny and way better brothers my whole life really does take a toll you know. ‘Look at him, he’s always so good.’ ‘You should lose weight look at how skinny he is.’ ‘Why can’t you be more like them.’ ‘What’s wrong with you? You’re a disappointment.’ I know I’ll never be like them and will just be bringing shame to the family. The real reason I’ve been so depressed is because I absolutely despise myself, I hate everything about myself, there’s nothing that I like I hate everything. I stopped caring about everyone and everything. They have always wondered why I’m always locked in my room talking to online friends; because that was that’s my safe haven. Online no one can judge me and they like me for me, and wouldn’t judge me for the way I look or dress as people do in real life. I like talking to them, that’s the only time I’ve been truly happy.

I can’t take it anymore. All the pain, the numbing sadness, the feeling of guilt for no reason, the self-loathing, the voices, everything. I just want it all to stop. I tried to end it all once again. I always fail. I lost count of all my failed attempts. I’m weak. I’m a failure. I can’t even kill myself properly.    


My mind wouldn’t shut up. The numbing sadness wouldn’t stop. None of it would stop. I had just gotten into a fight with my mum. I couldn’t take it anymore. I was already on the ledge and that just pushed me.   

I got my noose. I already had it tied and hidden in my closet. My mum wasn’t home at the moment. My father was at work. I had time. I tied it to the bar in my closet, high up. I climbed up onto the shelf in my closet. My closet is small so I was easily able to reach the noose from there. I stuck my head in it. I tested it by moving to the ledge of the shelf. It would be high up enough to properly kill me. This was it. I thought it was it. It would all be over. I slid off the shelf and held myself up with my arms. I was almost there. I just had to let go. I was so close...  and then I saw the picture of my mum and I. A picture of her hugging me. When the light was still in my eyes. When it hadn’t left. I looked happy in the picture as did my mum. We were so happy... My mind filled with memories of my mum and I. I remembered the words she told me. She would always love me...   

I broke down crying. I pushed myself back onto the shelf and sat there crying. I couldn’t do it. I wanted to do it, but I couldn’t. I was too scared to do it. I was scared about how my mum would react. I remembered her say that she would be a mess if one of her kids died while she was still alive. I remembered how she said she’d probably kill herself. I had been so selfish... I had once again tried to kill myself even after I had heard my mum say how painful it would be to loose a child, how devastated she would be. I’m still so selfish... I want to die. I still want to kill myself even though my mum would be sad. I’m terrible.   

I‘m a coward. All I ever do is run. I’m so ungrateful. People are dying of cancer in hospitals. There are people who have it so much worse than me.

Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable.

So if you were in my shoes, and you know that all you have to do is swallow 20 pills and there's a 99.98% chance that you'll feel AWESOME the first 10 minutes, then drugged and tired for the next half hour or so, then lose consciousness after 1-2 hours, then never regain consciousness.

SuicideWatch,"hi.

Its apitty that i post here again, i dont realy have whom to talk with and im realy tired of things that are turning my life. 

This is a hard period of my life,  all those things what i dreamed about in life, turns my mind agaist it pushing me thowards that one gateway. I tried suicide yesterday, Honestly i didint thought it will acure but it made me sleep with ease on my mind. Bag of shughar, and each time i try diferent things that makes nothing or makes me feel worse for days, eating coffe, salt, extasy, iburofen, tramadol, resperidon, and all stuf that i can found, on diferent ocasions trough last two years. I was suicidal since 2012, and this pereod i got hard on myself. Yah its been ten years i take care for my dad, well atliest hes not drinking now like he used to when our mother left us, i think that lead him to depresion where he was drinking almost each day, and so he fucked up his helth ewen further. so he spends his life in bed, we do ewen have hospital bed in chernobil like room that smels of tabacko. I would like to do a renovation have all things already, but four months ago when i started its seen how his helth got worse fiew hours in veelchair got him exhousted. so its stands like this. Yah i would like to go to mental hospistal to spend sometime, but there is nobady who would care for him who would help, i remember when i used to work abroad, there where people to helped him, helped him to drink, they brings him bread and botel of wodka, people that helps. And people who i should call family, i understand they have their lifes, but i get pised off, when i write on social media that i tried to kill myself again, each time i get response to stop doing nonsence, and how i dont see how they trully helpm me that im selfish not caryng for others. Yah shure they help me alot, so i cant ewen find notime to relax my mind caring for each meal to bring, money problem is always there, i dont know what my own money is. dont haeve a job becouse well its smal town and nothing ofers nothing that would fit with thigs i have to do. i fell huge pain becouse of love ishues, girl i love well... she cheated on me fiew months in realationship, and that was my firs gilfriend when i was 26. yah it enden up in such heartbrake that i started halucinating vvishualy and with sounds , there was my first suicide atempt. And all this shit around the world ewerithing in one big boiling uff that i cant do nothing about. And like all my hopes became to hang myself finaly when my father dies, spill his ashes as he asked , and hang myself without joking with things that might kill me, but to get that final blow, becouse i dont see the reason to live further, its just road of betrayels and misfortunes in my past, and pain each day that i can hear with each breath behind the wall. like nobady cares as it seems now and i dont know why should i care if tomorow gona be like today just worse","IM tired and need helping hand to stand up, i cant doit with no suport",t3_go2ifl,1

My family said i was never bad but I just feel like I was. I feel like I bullied people even though I was too. I was edgy and caused pain to people (most likely).

SuicideWatch,"I've always been an attention whore, even when I was little. All through primary school I was getting awards and recognition. I even passed an entrance exam to get into a local grammar school, but without a scholarship. All that stopped when I started secondary school. I was a nobody, so I started to pretend to like things to fit in. I only like musicals (which I really enjoy now) because I was trying to impress some older girls at music practice so I wouldn't have to be alone during practices. I only got into music because my parents pressured me into it and I can't stop because then others will overtake me and I'll be a failure and forgotten about(although I should say that my parents are very supportive of me). I even only pretended to be bi at first for attention, but I know now that I do like girls. I'm terrified of what will happen if I go through life unnoticed, and I even tried starving myself and even thought about killing myself just for attention. I'm even posting this on my main account in the hope that someone I know will see it so that they'll pay me attention, but that probably won't happen.


Today when I met one of my friends in the local park (social distancing permitting). She's a few years older than me and already auditioning for national orchestras and stuff. She has her whole life planned out and is already training to get into the RAF. Many of my friends are going to sixth form next year and I kind of feel like they're abandoning me and going off to have long, fulfilling lives. I always feel like I'm a child around them and that no matter what I do I come off as really immature.


All of my actions have been motivated by pride, vanity or cowardice and I hate myself for it. More than I can say. I've had thoughts of suicide since I was about 11 but I'm too scared to go through with it and I don't want to cause others pain from the aftermath. Life just feels really frustrating: everyone else seems to know what they're doing and where they stand, but whenever I try to explain it to someone they tell me that I'm too young to be worrying about it and that I should enjoy my youth. The only way I can see out of the frustration it by ending myself, but I know it will cause others pain in the aftermath and anyways, I'm too scared to do it. I do have people who care for me, but I'm scared that if I keep telling them about it they will think I'm doing it for attention, which I guess I kind of will be.

I know this really pales in comparison with other posts on here and I sound like a whiny child, but I wanted to see if anyone is going through anything similar.",Does anyone else feel that frustration really adds to suicidal thoughts?,t3_go5vkh,1

Hi, it is weird talking to random strangers on internet but no one would listen to me cause nobody cares. I am turning 14 in 9 days ( i am 13f), today both my grandmother and dog died. My grandmother was the only person who would listen to me and the only person who did know that i was depressive and suicidal. I started having problems with anxiety and panic atacks 1 year ago. Yesterday i got in a big fight with my mother who is alchohol and drugs addicted. I was really scared, i was scared that much that i peed(urinated? idk the word) myself, she said that i was a mistake 14 years ago and that she cant deal with me, that she could never deal with me. My dog was a dachshund he was 9 years old, we put him down cause of problems with spine and kidney failure he was the only friend i had since my best friend killed herself a year ago .  2 months ago i tried jumping from my balcony but when the moment came i just stood there on the end and started to cry, my grandmother heard me and promised not tell my mother. She talked me out of jumping. Today she died from cancer. Her funeral is in 5 days. I am thinking of jumping from my balcony in 9 days on my birthday.

SuicideWatch,"It's difficult to present yourself as someone who believes themselves to be unique and lone in their plight when everyone else claims to feel the same way. However, I've been dealing with absolute loneliness for an entire lifetime and have attempted suicide once already, all whilst constantly searching for someone who could've helped me understand my place in this world. It's hard to imagine that there is anyone out there with a similar thought process and state of mind when you've lived your entire life searching for any such person to no avail.

I've lived my entire 21 years alone alongside neglecting parents who've substituted their presence during my childhood with video games that were supposed to fill the void. I had close to no social training during my earliest stages of life, and so the only friends I could've made during my childhood were through the games I played at the time. At school I was only known as the eccentric shy kid that no one would bother themselves with. I grew up playing a lot of RPGs and FF. I remember at a very early age I got my hands on FF7 for the PS, I must've been 8 or 9 at the time. I played that game on and off for years, I don't think I beat it until I was 12 something years old. At that time I had already familiarized myself with the game and all it's characters, I had grown up associating my personality and sense of self with this game and the many others I had played. As time progressed throughout my childhood I only became more and more eccentric and weird considering everything about me was based off video games and a culture that no one near me really understood. I never managed to find anyone I could've called a close friend, and in my later teens I had learned to keep to myself and not to open up to anyone as it would only lead to confusion and on my end, hurt.

I feel as if though my life was never real, it took place on some far away land where I grew up happily surrounded by people that were never real. Reality is fiction to me. I am going to die and become part of what was never real, this time for sure.",Do I even exist in the first place?,t3_go5cny,1
SuicideWatch,"Life feels like too much struggle for too little joy. I struggle with this every day. Perhaps due to my genetic predisposition towards anxiety, every minor event is a trigger towards suicidal thoughts. I hate it. This struggle, this lack of knowledge or control, this... living.

Ive got no special talents or dreams, just a constant annoyed feeling that I have to do anything. If Starving / dehydration or homelessness wasnt so much more effort than a regular existence I would have stayed on the street and sat it out till I died. All I want to do all dy is spend as much time asleep as possible, even if it means not eating until it gets annoying.  Thought that if thats really all I want then theres a better way to do it.

Yeah, people will disregard those thoughts. They'll say you're ""depressed"". They'll say meaning is in the little things. They'll try and help you with inhibitors, counselling and hollow advice. They'll cut you out 'cause ""wow that negative energy is too much, man"" only because they dont want to face the truth themselves, hiding behind their ""LIVE,LOVE,WHATEVER"" posters and their stupid ""meaningful"" mottos they have on their mugs or inked on their forearms.

SuicideWatch,"Hello,

So as the title states, the only reason i haven't killed myself is my mom. Her love for her children is endless, she even panics when i miss a call from her or i'm late, since she immediately suspects something might have happened to me. So if i or anyone of my siblings happened to die, the resulting stress would most likely kill her considering she suffers from diabetes and hypertension. 

But i can't bear life anymore, i'm stupid as hell in everyday life, can't think for the love of god, have no common sense and will probably work a minimum wage job for the rest of my life, if i ever even find a job. 

 Even beyond that i'm a social catastrophy. I have only two friends i barely do something with because socializing drains the little brain energy that i have. I am also unable to make new friends since this pile of shit i have in my head, made it impossible for me to develop any interests or hobbies. Thinking about the simplest things overwhelms me. I will never find a partner as well because i'm hideous. On top of that i'm male and short. From a evolutionary perspective i'm the last person that should procreate.

I've been in a dump of sadness for awhile now and recently got an incredible tooth pain stacked on top of that which has altogether been great. As far as the basic dentist stuff goes, I went in for it on Tuesday and expected to have a root canal done (because that's what I was told was gonna happen), but instead just got X-rays done and told l'll go back again but I dont even fucking know when that is. As far as mental stuff, life has just been so unappealing lately and I have no interest in it or the future. I have 0 confidence in myself and no self worth and it feels like it just gets worse as each day goes by. I work through it in therapy and what not but I don't think self love is something I'll ever experience and it's rather damaging.

I just don't know what to do with it all. 
This has been a normal thing for the past year or so and I every now and then get to a low point where the debate of suicide comes up but I never go through it whether be because of fear of what's afterwards or something else. It's been especially terrible this past month, I relapsed and fell back into self harming again. But now there's this pressing unbearable pain that isn't just a mental thing and I want more than anything for it to just stop. It's currently 5 am and I'm at a fucking loss at what to do. I just wanna die and the thought of downing a bottle of meds to end it all, the teeth pain and the mental pain as well, feels so appealing. I finally have a pain that is physically overwhelming and might push me over to do something severe to stop it and it's somewhat comforting in a way.

I’m not a religious person but these days I’ve been praying a lot. I’ve been praying for given a break, a stop point to rest for awhile. My chest hurts remembering everything that could’ve been right which I did wrong and it’s so painful to see that all I can do about it is standing still throwing the knife I was so ready to stab upon my chest. I had to stay strong.

I look around and see nothing but blurry pictures of people that loves me. Friends, families, lover; all of them are blurred because I was so programmed to not to see their grace and love. I was constructed to denying love; so when I was given one then I’m terrified of the happy feeling. Always thought that after a little bit of happiness, there must be a sorrow so I always hold myself down from feeling happy.

When was the last time I feel happy? I don’t remember anymore. Well, maybe 3 minutes ago when my Go-Food arrived. Maybe 5 hours ago when my breakfast ready. But all of these are just utopic happiness; not a genuine one. Look, I start to define happiness as if I understand what I’m saying. I don’t.

I wish everything wouldn’t be this painful. I pray to God for the pain to stop. But no God listens. No one listens. So I stop praying and hoping altogether.

And then you realize that the ones you love will never love you back...


You watch them as they're showing you a stupid video on youtube that you only pretend to care about because they like it so much and you love how their honey-brown eyes light up. Or how they adore their dog so very much and he tell her he loves her but you know you're never going to hear those words uttered to you. Or how you look forward to hearing their voice after a long day and he says he's too tired to talk to you. 

He wasn't the only one.

The other used to message you how much he liked watching you workout. His baby blue eyes and all his muscles and strength... there's no way he would notice me. He said that i understood him because he was never appreciated, just like i was. But would only want my legs wrapped around him when he had a fight with his wife. Then when the worst happened...he made feel less than worthless. Leave his unhappy loveless marriage for me? Silly girl.

But first the one that broke me. The one i gave up my dreams for, he was relentless in the beginning. I had aspirations and goals and dreams. I threw them away because he asked me to stay. The only person who showed me kindness at the time. I gave him everything i knew, everything i had.  Eventually, slowly he broke my heart. First  it was the little things, not wanting to fight, me noticing resentment. Then the passive aggressive behavior,  then the demeaning remarks that ate at any little self esteem i had.

Then one deployment...when he came back he was different and I knew, you can see it when they smile at a text they receive, or they tell you I'm just going for a long car ride, or when they take their phone in the bathroom. Then they dont touch you or look at you or support you or care. Then your voice isnt heard, and you feel so very small. When you realize its too late and you dont care because you're so hopped up on anxiety medication from the anxiety of why they're acting like that, and its too late. The love you once felt is gone, then you feel shame and like a failure. 

Then you know that no one will love you. No one will cry like you are this second, for you or wish you would stay. You will be a regret, you will be ""too much"". You will feel grief and so much shame from the will to die and not ever feeling love back the way you give. You feel ashamed for playing victim and not living your life in integrity or honesty.

She was the boss of a company that gave aid to senior citizens, and she was regarded as kind and selfless.

Back at home however, I begged for mercy to all the gods in the universe to please kill me, but my prayers went unanswered.

SuicideWatch,"hey everyone,

i’m not sure this is the right place to post but tomorrow’s my birthday. and as i sit here on this couch, i just think, it’s been 841 days since my attempt. and i’ve had relapses of suicidal thought since then, self harm, panic attacks, and all of that. i didnt even know if i’d be alive today up to two weeks ago. my family is not emotionally safe for me and i’ve been stuck with them because of quarantine. i have severe pmdd and it makes me feel like a slave to my hormones, and i feel like it isn’t real, especially because i’m a teen and i think it’s just me being young. i’ve called the suicide hotline three times as often during quarantine as i did when i attempted. but honestly, right now, i feel on top of the world. or at least not suicidal.

tomorrow’s my birthday. i did it. i did it for 841 days, and it wasn’t easy. it was mindblowingly, painstakingly, fucking annoyingly difficult, but i’m here.

i don’t know why i’m emotional right now but im just proud of myself. i don’t even know why i live but i’m here. and i’m alive, and breathing, and haven’t cut in two weeks.

thank you for reading. i love you, i’m proud of you, and i hope you will have one of these moments too. have a good night.",feeling serene,t3_gnqcv2,1
SuicideWatch,"There is so much things i want to say that i dont know what to start from

I am an addict. I am addicted to gaming and porn and even tho i try my best to break with it but  all my work on restraining myself fucks itself over each few days. 

My mother brought me up i saw my father very rarely

At the beggining of school year (im 15 at this moment) i moved to another city tried to start life over from the beggining - get to know people and have a blank card while getting to know them, because in the previous place where i lived i was bullied from beggining of primary school due to my scar that covers my whole chest. 

And the year begun good. I met a few friends and am bullied and talked shit about no more but this year is the worst one i ever had.

All of my previous life have been erased for me i no longer keep contact with people i knew and i no longer have to deal with neighbours who tried to make life hell for my family

But before the virus trouble started. My mum got breast cancer. I couldnt do a shit to help her. Shit i couldnt do a shit to even meet her in person since she was over 250 km away.

She fought it and i had hope to go on with my life.

Wrong. Today my dad told me through a slip of tounge that we are going to the place i lived before because of my sisters suicide attempt.

I feel like there is no tomorrow where everything will be ok.

I feel like shit and i want to go in steps of my sister

 And the worst part is that i dont even know if she is ok at the moment since i didnt even had an opportunity to talk with her or my mum",This year has gone to shit for me,t3_gnzemg,1
SuicideWatch,"I've had suicidal tendencies since I was a child and I'm at my breaking point, I have been for a while now.

I grew up in an abusive home. My dad would physically abuse my mother and she ran away taking me with her at the age of two. We went from battered women shelter to relatives and back and forth for a while until she was able to get back on her feet. 

I don't remember too much as a child but I know that I used to act out a lot.  My mom would take her frustrations and anger out on me by spanking, beating, punching and kicking etc. I think I grew up in a very bad area because there were many children in similar situations. I don't really blame my mom or hate her. She dealt with a lot growing up. I'm not saying it's right but I don't resent her. 

I would read anything I could get my hands on. Magazines, books, newspapers. I always wondered what happened to peoole.when they died. I think I was trying to find ways to deal with the trama of being hit on a daily basis. She would lock me in my room after abusing me and I would always just read or cry until I couldn't anymore. I secretly hoped someone would just erase me from the world. I asked her why she brought me into the world if she hated me so much. She never gave me a definitive answer, however she started crying and from them on she became fixated on Christianity and praising God/Jesus and asking forgiveness. I think she was ashamed.

As I grew up I started to do worse in school. I would pick fights and skip classes. I was too cowardly to kill myself even though I fantasized about it constantly. I tried talking to the school therapists but it didn't help much. I felt as if no one ever understood me. Until I met this one girl. She was so amazing, or so I thought then. She listened to me, made me laugh and I thought I'd found my reason to live perhaps. I didn't feel like killing myself so much anymore.

A few months go by and I want to ask her to prom. So I go to her house to surprise her, find her fucking a guy from my economics class. Big dude. I freak out and run out of the house past her dad who admittedly probably didn't like me much. 

I get home and just start taking anything I can find in the medicine cabinet. I'm hoping I can put myself out of my misery with this and I can finally have some peace. 

I wake up in a hospital with no one there except the nurse examining my ivs and monitoring my vitals. They had to pump my stomach, and because of all the different drugs I ingested they weren't able to completely stop the side effects, I now have heart palpitations, due to a damaged aortic valve. They hurt. A lot. Turns out my mom came home early from work and saw me writhing on the floor having a seizure. She called 911 and then had a panic attack that resulted in cardiac arrest.

I almost killed her. She was also in the hospital. She's never been the same since. 

I keep getting into relationships that end up in failure cause of my own self loathing and depression. I keep hurting women. I waste my time in college not finishing my degree fully. I rack up huge sums of student loan debt. I waste opportunities to become more financially stable. I start drinking cause I truly hate myself and I want to die. 

Fast forward to now. I'm 29, I have nothing to show for myself. I've wasted my whole life. I feel like I can't keep going. I can't keep meaningful relationships together due to my own inadequacies. I pick fights with my friends. I push everyone away.

I'm so tired of feeling like this. I want some force of nature to come pass wrath on me. I've tried to kill myself but I'm afraid. Afraid of the pain. Afraid of what people will say. Afraid of what they won't say. 

Why is life so hard? Was I put on this earth to suffer? I feel like I've never made a real impact on anyone's life. I want to sleep and never wake up. My parents wouldn't care I feel.

I am a piece of garbage and realizing this at the age of 20 hits really hard and honestly, i deserve nothing other than death. I’m so so miserable. I’m selfish, self-centered and i dont have empathy for anyone. I am beyond clueless. I don’t think I ever loved anyone including my family members. I was bullied in school for my sexuality and it was really my fault because i was going around and trusted every other person who would smile once and told them everything about my personal life, who i had fucked with, that i had a sugar daddy etc. And those stories spread around like what he fuck i was thinking?That’s alright tho i was a kid. But i havent changed much since then. I was jumping from relationships to relationships and all i cared about was boys and sex, appearence. Nothing deeper than that. Im also very close minded, rude, lazy overall just an asshole nobody wants to be around with and i was so entitled i was blaming others for not liking me. All i cared about was my appearence and how i was dressed (yet i dress really badly). There is no depth in me like at all. Ive complained all my life about everything.

I struggle with depression since i was 10 years old but the last few years it was okay.

But since corona became a widespread disease everything in my life went horribly wrong. My parents are very close from getting divorced. I lost the contact to my best friends. And the school stuff is way to much stress for me right now. 

I just cant handle this ammount of stress anymore. I just dont enjoy my life anymore. everyday i wake up. i hear them arguing. i look at my phone, no of my friends texted to me. i barely eat and drink anything. all i do is just laying in bed, crying and thinking. I try to distract me with my phone from my feelings. but that only makes me even more depressed. I sometimes see the storys of my best friends how they are outside together. and that without me. I just want everything to be okay. 

I also was in therapy from 2016 to the end of 2019. I thinked its over with my problems but now im too scared to tell my parents about my problems and that i want the therapy to continue. Im too scared that i will make their situation even worse.

I was living alone in an apartment I could barely afford, and hated my job. I lived a few blocks away from the highest bridge in my city. One dark night, I decided (while cutting myself) that I should go do it. Id walked the bridge a few times, identified an area where by jumping I'd hit a basketball court.

I think it helps with some of the anxiety but even taking 20 won't stop the feeling so I try to make it last till the next script because without it is just withdraws and pain. The weed doesn't get me high anymore. I've built up a tolerance where I'm not even sure it's doing anything but getting rid of my chronic migraines. I still smoke an ounce or two a month. It's expensive but I don't have the money. I have no money. The Khalua helps the most. I used too much and it was basically 75% coffee liquor and 25% espresso. I'm all out of it though and the liquor store is closed. I don't want to become an alcoholic as is a fallacy of many of my family members including my brother. I don't want to run out of Xanex again but I've taken 5 now. I don't want to burn through my parents cash on weed but I'm down to crumbs and my dealer rips me off. I met him at a Dubstep show in the city and took some acid. I've tried acid 3 times now in my life, It has no effect. Ecstasy apparently has no effect either. I'm on too many medications that don't allow it.

I just want to escape the depression. I can't cry right now but I wish I could. Sometimes I can't stop crying. I sleep all day, wake up, cry, fall back asleep until I wake up again. There's never any reason to get out of bed. Not today and not on any of the days I can cry. 4 years ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing on all of the meds I had. I possessed some 90 day supplies of some \~8 different meds that I was on and leftovers of meds I had been on. I don't even know what all the meds I'm on are at the moment off the top of my head. There's so many. My mother keeps them locked up, but I don't think I'd ever try to OD again. My stomach is usually in a pretty poor state to the point I throw up every morning. If I have a migraine I throw up until I'm so exhausted I fall asleep. Because of the vomiting I can't take a pill and expect it to work. If you're familiar with migraines you're probably familiar with triptans and how much they suck. I have needles for them. Sumatriptan. Makes you feel like absolute shit but it clears some of the migraine up. But that's a little off-topic. I've had migraines since I can remember and it's a weekly deal without marijuana which for some reason my state won't even legalize medicinally. So I pay my dealer obscene prices per ounce to get by. I can't find another dealer of course since I haven't really spent much time outside of the house in 10 years and was lucky to find one at all.

The 10 year thing probably needs explanation. I'd rather not say where I'm from or where I moved to but 10 years ago I moved from the far northern US to the far south. I miss the snow the most. I haven't seen snow in a very long time. My parents moved down here for my father's work and I came along. My parents are great. They put up with so much from me. All the horrible things I've said and done to them in moments of disillusionment. How many times I've ruined their plans with a depressive episode or embarrassed them in a fit of mania. Bandaging up the scars on my arm that I make to feel something other than apathy. I think when I try next. When the time is right and no one else is home I won't overdose again. I'll cut my wrists in the bath deep enough to have a result. I just can't be allowed to fail. If I fail they'll put me back in one of those 72 hr holds. 

I stayed 2 weeks in hell the last time I tried to kill myself, fucked up on all the drugs I took I lost the ability to walk for awhile among other things. You know what they do in a mental hospital? I've been many times so I can tell you. They wheel you in, leave you in a dark room next to a bed on the floor until someone else finds you and helps you into that bed. Hopefully the one who left me there sitting in a wheelchair stoned out of my mind unable to walk was fired. Who knows. One of the hospitals knows me pretty well now. The last time I panicked and resorted to going back the token black employee remembered me instantly. I told him I liked the food better at this hospital than the others the time before I was there. When I arrived in the ward and sat down with some others there I heard a story of something someone did here once, me. An embarrassing story that I won't repeat but apparently was known by everyone, doctors and patients alike. When the nurse checked my vitals I tried to make a normal comment once. ""I like your shoes, I have ones just like those"" about her black converse high tops. She proceeded to call me a psychopath and shuffle away when she was done. Of course the comments on the food never stopped because the black employee told a patient or another and rumors spread about me. Ostracized even in a place meant to help. The mental health system in the US has a long way to go. I met with a psychiatrist who seemed bored the entire time and prescribed me various meds my doctor has never put me on. The therapist I met with I unloaded on with my insanity. He remembered me from last time and as usual. Therapists can't help those that are truly sick. All my problems change from day to day and I think he also knew I was hopeless.

At the time before I moved I wasn't really eating and lost a ton of weight. A girl broke my heart which sent me into a spiral of depression lasting to this day. I'd survive in school on a cheese filled breadstick in the lunch room, where I sat alone and people would throw things at me. I had so much social anxiety I could only talk to my friends. Back then I was only on Adderall as a medication and I used it gratuitously. If you take Adderall, don't eat and don't drink. You get a euphoric focused feeling along with cottonmouth that even makes math fun. So basically I was zoned out all my Senior year on Adderall hanging out at drug houses in my heroin addled town. I've never tried heroin but after I moved my group of friends did. Some of them are dead now. Two I know of are in prison for race related crimes. My friends and I were the ""townies"" back in high school we could always be found in the public park smoking cigarettes that we got different people to buy for us. Some of them were some interesting characters like Jeff &amp; Marie. 

Jeff &amp; Marie lived in a small unkempt apartment with a countless number of cats. We'd go over, smoke some weed with them and give Jeff a large tip to go across the street to the Indian at the gas station and buy us alcohol and cigarettes. Marie died before I moved. She started to turn yellow and one day passed away of jaundice. Jeff and Marie were never together, at least as far as I knew. When Marie died my friend and I out of appreciation for Jeff helped him move with some assistance from the church they attended. There were literal mountains of cat feces behind every possible object. Moving things around stirred up the smell and I think that was the reason Marie died. Years later I found out that my friend that helped move them found Jeff living under the highway underpass. He'd bring him Lunchables and beer nuts and he eventually disappeared. They never seemed to have any friends, or family. I don't think anyone else missed them.

Moving right before I was to go to college wasn't good for me. I missed my friends a lot. They were really all I had. The one thing that bugs me the most is that I wasn't there to help them. Keep them away from dope. I was always the straight edged one. Or the most straight edged you could get in a group of teenage law breakers. After moving we kept in touch somewhat. One of my friends made a Facebook group and we'd talk about random things, it didn't last long. Years later he would call me when he shot up and talk to me. I think he wanted me to stop him. He's in prison for the second time now. These days I've lost touch with all but a couple. Ones a rapper now by the name of Sickwit and the other, Big Mike works at the Wendy's in town. He just got his license back and plans to become a mechanic.

But that's enough about the past. It haunts me enough and even the smallest memories of mistreatment or embarrassment make me shiver. The girl who broke my heart, the Adderall fueled weight loss, the friends who mistreated me and kids in school who berated me for being quiet and different. These days all of my friends are online. Some I've known for around 15 years or even longer over various PC games. Lately though, I've been losing many of them. I'll say something almost on purpose that I know will drive them away. One friend lost means multiple mutual friends gone. I'm not worth it compared to her, or him. I'm too erratic and my mood is never consistent. I consider friends very important to me. If I'm depressed I don't resort to therapists. They've never done anything for me. I try to count on my friends but even people you think can help you through anything will get sick and disgusted with you eventually and I'm on the verge of losing one of the ones I've known for over 15 years.

I can't handle losing friends. I don't know why. Or maybe I do but I don't want to explain it. I want everyone in the world to hate me so no one will miss me. I've betrayed them multiple times by cutting contact, deleting accounts and isolating myself in my depression. Some come back, some don't. I receive minimal checks from the government for my conditions. But I can't hold down a job. I've had a few through the years but even volunteer work I seem to fail at. What worries me the most about getting a job is failure. I attended college for a token few classes after moving down here before the depression hit the hardest. I want to go back but of course, COVID-19. Plus I've wanted to go back for years and I just can't get it done. Last time I was in college I had hair down to my shoulders, wore jeans absolutely full of holes and talked to no one. Once in my music appreciation class I raised my hand to answer a question and the entire class stopped as I spoke and stared at me. Asking me questions until the teacher broke it up and continued the lecture. I stuck out like a sore thumb as I always do.

My parents are very generous to me and I have some nice things. These things regularly fill me with guilt but my mother is so generous and loving that she won't even let me say no to a gift. If I were to kill myself I know that everyone else could move on. They'd all see it coming. 'He was going to do it eventually'. It's all I can think about after all. I'm just afraid of the act. Even more afraid of failing and being institutionalized and I can't help but think of what my mother would do without me. She's very Ill and has been my whole life. Rheumatoid  Arthritis has ravaged her body along with heart issues requiring a pacemaker and a slew of medications and injections she has to take regularly. Not nearly as many pills as I take but for physical reasons. Not stupid mental issues.

There's so much more that depresses me but I don't need a reason to cry anymore. I just do it. Nothing in the world can solve my problems. Therapy has failed multiple times. Mental Hospitals are hell on earth. ECTs, just destroy my memory. I can barely remember these past years due to the few series's of treatment I've had. Always going back because I think they might work but they never do. I can't find a girlfriend and have only had sex once in the past 10 years due to a Tinder hookup. These are my 20s and they're supposed to be filled with so much joy. I don't think I own a blade sharp enough. I want a new razor blade since all the ones I can find are just rusty.

SuicideWatch,"Been pretending to be someone else for so long I can't remember who I am, I just know I hate the person I am, and nobody liked the person I was. I'm so lonely but just want to be left alone. I feel like I'm dreaming 75% of the time and only apply meaning to things that aren't real... coincidences, whatever makes sense if my life was a narrative. Nothing that makes sense anymore. It feels like I'm standing behind a sheet of glass, and straight up shut down when there's any stress at all. Basically go blind and hope muscle memory gets me through. I shouldn't be driving, and I should be dead from speeding the past year. 

Career's over, and that was the only thing that kept me motivated. Can't come clean to anyone why I quit. Can't visualise a week from now, let alone 10/20/40/50 years. Just a void. Best case is ""a job"", but I can't even afford to move out now. 

Meds make me feel like I'm faking being happy and that I was faking being depressed. Legitimately think it's self inflicted and I just want to be a victim, and that I can just stop being like this but I chose not to. But I don't, and I keep sabotaging myself from getting better.

The part of my family in my life are generally supportive and loving, I have enough money to survive, people generally like me for some reason, etc. But I just constantly feel so worthless. Like I should stop bothering to try since I just manage to accidentally screw things up in some way. I feel like since everyone around me is better in some way I'm literally the worst. I feel like any little bit of trouble I cause needs to have a physical repercussion, so I self-harm pretty regularly. Though I switched from cutting to picking at my skin as I can explain it away as a stress reaction so as to worry people less. I've gouged a new hole in the back of my heel as I'm writing this due to an argument that occurred a few hours ago now. 

I have no exact plans, though I am prone to self-harm and live in an environment where an overdose by pills would be super accessible. The thing isn't so much as I feel a reason to live as much as I feel like it would be a waste or just too difficult for me to pull off. Like I'd fuck it up somehow like my half-assed attempt a year and a half or so ago. 

I almost got hit by a speeding car running a red light today while walking the dog. If my younger sibling wasn't there I would have been utterly okay with being hit. I don't want to put them through anymore trauma than I've already inadvertently caused with my existence.

SuicideWatch,"A little over a year ago I nearly killed myself. Now, I’m in a much better place, I’m supposed to be recovered and okay, but deep down i’m holding on by a thread. 

Growing up, I hated myself, I was always a little chubby and weird and I never really had any friends which set me up for a lot of bullying. During my second year of high 
school I started to loose weight naturally, a few people started to treat me differently (like a person for once) and as soon as I noticed, everything changed. I thought that if i lost “the rest” of the weight i’d actually feel accepted around other people for once, but that quickly turned into extreme bulimia and anorexia which continued to get worse until I was taken from home and sent to an eating disorders clinic. 

All the pills and therapy that came with my discharge from the hospital and I was still depressed and obsessed with myself. It went on for what felt like years, until I met a special someone. 

I wanted to get better to be with him and he was willing to do anything to help. Together we ‘got through it’, I became as healthy and happy as I ever could be. We’ve been together for awhile now, nothing has changed, I’m still okay..still in love..still happy..that’s why I don’t get it..why do I not want to be alive? why am I miserable?

SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone,

Almost a year ago, I wrote a message here where I stated that I wanted to kill myself. I was positive that I would end my life back then. I could not see into the future at all. Everything had gone downhill for years, I had struggled with mental illness ever since I was a preteen, and the final trigger happened when I was rejected out of university when I wanted to change the field I was studying in because my current one was making my mental health horrible due to many reasons. It meant that I would have to take a gap year in order to keep it together and stay alive, and struggle financially when I was too depressed to work.

I'm not gonna lie, the gap year was one of the worst experiences I had ever had in my life. I was struggling a lot, both mentally and financially, and I also happened to attempt suicide one time. I don't actually know how I managed to stay alive to this day, but I'm kind of glad I did, I guess.

A few days ago, I got some good news. I had applied for the same field again this year that I had applied for last year, and heard that I was finally accepted! I still can't believe it. It's such a relief that when everything is still kind of falling apart, something good can still happen despite all of those hardships. Me getting in isn't of course a magic solution to all my problems. It just shows that even though I've felt like I couldn't go on most of the time, something good can still happen to me. This isn't the end of my stuggles, this is just the beginning of a hopeful journey

Because I’m so worthless I don’t even deserve the title of being worthless, I don’t even deserve to get help do I? I mean all the distractions are becoming boring so with Covid, that I can’t even begin anime without wanting to die at that moment, maybe it’s just everything is finally catching up to me, all the bad things that I’ve been thinking, all my bad memories. But eh I’m probably just making a big deal out of nothing.",Should I continue living.,t3_gnt48l,1
SuicideWatch,"I know it's such a cliche thing to ask but it's true. Recently these incredibly intrusive suicidal thoughts have been going through my mind and usually keeping me up at night, every once in a while I just break down into tears and cannot do anything else for the rest of the day, I can't work, eat, sleep, nothing just cry for the rest of the day. With the suicidal thoughts started a genuine question of ""why should I keep going?"" And I honestly cannot answer it, I have nothing going for me and I've made my family's life a living hell, if I was gone my family would be sad of course, but only for a year or so and after that it'll be like I never existed and everything will be able to go back to how it was before I was born, even if I lived until I was 90 and had a house with a perfect family once my future kids die my entire life is forgotten and everything I worked for is now pointless, dying now compared to dying later genuinely has absolutely no difference to it in my eyes.

PS, I do apologise for typing so much it's just really been bothering me recently.",What is the actual reason for living?,t3_gnt2qu,1
SuicideWatch,"I’m looking for some sort of guidance, information, or reassurance. I believe I am experiencing dissociation or something of the sort. I feel like nothing is real and I have no emotion about anything accept the thoughts and memories of real life. I spend all of my time trying to get over my issues there is a large amount of information out there about others who are experiencing a similar problem and advice on how to get over it. 

However I have another problem which leads me to believe that I am a superstar case from all these people. I’m very undereducated as I have just begun doing research. My problems started when I was a sophomore and I am now 17. For a long time I told no one and just tried to deal with it on my own. Things got worse and worse until finally I told my parents and asked for help. They think I just have anxiety (which is true) but there is a lot more to it. I digress anyways I’m well aware of my ignorance as a 17 year old who just began research I just need some direction or information. I’m sorry that was a really long way of saying I’m undereducated in this topic. 

I digress, my other problem is the fact that I can’t speak my own words. It feels like all of my words whether speech or text are filtered before they are spoken or typed. I still have my own thoughts and I know that to some extent I’m still the same person I was before all of this started, but I’m unable to speak in my own voice. Also I don’t really know how to describe it but when I’m getting ready to talk in front of people sometimes I start speaking in my head in the voice that isn’t actually mine. The same thing happens when I’m getting really anxious or having an anxiety attack. It makes me feel like I’m going crazy. It has been this way for a year and a half and it’s really hard to explain but it’s been here and stayed here for a long time. It’s like I am acting really really well and I am unable to stop no matter how hard I try. I have thoughts and emotions and I think that they are completely separate from this “voice” or “act” that I’ve assumed but I simply can’t genuinely express them without them first being filtered through my “voice.” I really don’t know how to express this and I don’t know if anyone has followed or been able to relate in anyway but this has been my state since the winter of my sophomore year. I can’t make or keep friends because I can’t express myself or speak genuinely and all my words feel like they are coming out of the mouth of a narcissistic psychopath which I may be the farthest person from. Saying that makes me feel like a psychopath path but that’s what’s going on in my situation. 

I told my therapist and he didn’t really give me a clear answer as to what I’m experiencing means or is. I don’t know if that’s because he wasn’t sure or I didn’t communicate clearly (entirely possible) or because he didn’t want to tell me that I’m going crazy. I haven’t told my parents about any of this stuff. Not even the “I feel like the world isn’t real” feelings of dissociation which would be much more easy to tell them than I can’t speak my own words. I guess I don’t want them to think I’m going crazy which I think I might be. I know that dissociation is a very conquerable problem but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a different case which is incurable. I’m convinced I’m going crazy. I’ve been contemplating suicide for the past month. There was one week were I would try everyday to bring myself to doing it but I couldn’t. I atleast want to fight a little bit longer. I’ve decided that I will wait until I graduate high school and if nothing has changed I will kill myself. 

I’m looking for advice, information, or reassurance of some sort that I’m not the only one and that I’m not going crazy. I just need a little bit of hope because I’ve tried just about everything in the past year and a half and I’ve gotten no where but a darker place.",I can’t speak my own words.,t3_gnszve,1

SuicideWatch,"I've been asexual for as long as I can feel it. I barely have attraction. Sometimes I feel broken or feel bad for every person who has good perspective of me turns bad because of my sexuality and my outlook on life. My opinions doesn't matter but I feel out of place every time. I can't relate to anyone. A year ago.. My 6 months of doing things I don't want to do but I want to be someone else who had confident and stuff. I sent out nudes to people based on my pick. Not many guys but in the course of 6 months I was self harming to the point a guy threatened me to rape me and share my pictures. It was a mental torture I've come up with ways of suicide.



Days of researching. I feel like my anxiety feeling and depression are my defaults. I can never feel or live in the present I've always feel like myself in this state that's why I want more mental torture. Now, I've seen it like this. I don't know what happiness is. I feel like it's never been there for me in a first place. People come and go yes. But mostly people just slipping by and I'm just looking through the window. I see those nudes as a payment to men. In my country there's a phrase of 'pakai jatah' it means debt and I've seen guys asking for sex to their wives as a sex debt because they are married.



And my nudes is not fully as self harm I know. In my perspective sex is not on my dictionary I don't know how horniness works. I could care less about the guy use the pictures to masturbate but it's only for those people. I don't want it to be exploited. I'm a fan of pin up girls, lingerie garments delicate fabrics and burdoir just for the sake of human female body. Mine is not best but that's the closest thing I can photograph because I see myself not as physical being anymore. I don't like my body.. I've a lot going on in my mind.

SuicideWatch,"My family is pretty dysfunctional to say the least (don’t want to get into any major detail due to how severe some of the stuff can be.)
I have a very good relationship with my three sisters and brother but my relationship with my mother and my father is practically in pieces, especially my father. My mother and my father were never taught to be emotionally communicative due to their culture so they kinda passed that out onto their children, they also normalized their constant fighting and bickering which could’ve turned into something insane at times. I tried to commit suicide a few months ago by attempting to hang myself, but the pain was too much for me to handle so I ended up not going through with it. I only told one of my sisters Kaitlynn about my attempted hanging and I promised her not to ever do it again.

I don’t know if I can keep this promise. My relationship with my father feels worse and although I’m improving my relationship with my mother the connection between me and my dad grows significantly worse by the day. He’s said and done some terrible things to me, things that make me uncomfortable and that I think about every second of the day, but he’s my dad so I want to respect him, I want to love him, even if it’s not returned, I don’t care.

i remember vividly, this started out when i was around nine or ten when i got extremely sick and my classmates and teachers congratulated me saying how good i looked when i lost weight. i resorted to starving myself, i made it a task to only eat a piece of bread for months until i can see my ribcages. at that time, i was happy and yet in a very toxic mindset.
i'm still trying that method to lose weight up to this day but it doesn't satisfy me anymore. i felt disconnected with my own body thus i resorted to cutting to make myself feel something. despite it being painful, i tell myself, that at least there's something to remind me that i'm human.

as i grew into my late teenage years, i feel more and more like a subconcious living in a physical body rather than an actual human; i hated my physique, i hated having a very feminine figure. i wanted to be petite, i don't like my chest and how every time i see an outfit i like, it ruins everything for me.

SuicideWatch,"I’ve hated being asian since I was 4 years old, it’s surprising how racism can even effect young children minds I was made fun of at an early age, I was the 1 of 2 asians basically in my city and it made me despise my race and I ended up dropping out, I have no education. I was put into mental hospitals because I tried killing myself when I was (14) and another time when I was (23) because I hated my race only for them to end up telling me I was (seeing things) when I told them the statistics. They told me that it wasn’t true that asians are represented just fine. Growing up without asian male role models really made me go through some weird identify crisis 


The good thing about the mental hospital is it got me into Christianity into reading the Bible. But I’ve been praying and praying and praying and praying about something to change about how I view my race or my future prospects of getting a chances with girls and it seems nothing is healing this feeling. I even used to pray about this when I was very young 12 or so and as time went on it became worse.


It’s starting to weigh on me. I know being a Christian I should be content in any situation like what Paul’s says. I have placed my burdens and anxietys up to God aswell but it’s been so many years. there’s something that always picks at my mind when it’s been years after year, and all the statistics of real life, media, sports, television, books,history. I used to go past bars and populated areas of the city and notice no girls are with asian men.

I’m going to keep praying keep working out keep improving but seems like I’m eventually in the future going to end it all. 


Now I’ve tried therapy phycologists went to mental hospitals (wasn’t diagnosed with anything) and it just seems like they always beat around the bush. They tell me I’m seeing things that this isn’t happening. But all the statistics of real life media sports music history go to Barnes and Noble and check out the romance novel covers there not a single asian male  I don’t know how else to describe it it. The thing I’ve noticed aswell is that its made girls because of there media upbringing maybe not (racist) towards asians but it’s maybe made the majority have some strange (dating racism) to happen because of the lack of romance within the media of Asian males. 


I feel weak fragile and I know I should be maning up. Wich I have been for many years. But it’s starting to chip away at me still year after year. This is quite embarrassing to post but it’s gotten to the point where I need some insight. I read my Bible everyday I pray everyday. But I’m starting to notice my friends/people I know obtaining wives houses getting good jobs.

SuicideWatch,"TLDR; had my first in person session with a new therapist who immediately launched into EMDR with me over my most visceral childhood trauma memory. Wondering if it’s normal to start such intense work with a stranger. Feeling incredibly suicidal (tried to post in r/EMDR but it would not allow me to). 

I had my first EMDR session today and I feel like I have been traumatized all over again. 

First of all, this therapist is brand new to me. I have had one prior appointment with her via FaceTime (on Friday). I really liked her on the phone, gave her some of my back story, she told me EMDR could help process some childhood trauma and I was very excited to meet her in person today. 

When I walked into the office, she asked me if I liked a poster she’d bought. I told her yes. She asked how my day was, I said fine. Then she asked if I was ready to start EMDR. I said sure, I have no idea what the process looks like and assumed she knew best. 

She went through a few things first, find a safe place, body scan, identify safe people and one protector. Then, she asked me to recall my most vivid childhood trauma memory. She had me walk myself through it in my own head while tapping, told me what a good job I was doing, and reminded me to breathe throughout. Second body scan. Then go back to the memory with your safe people. 

I completely dissociated. I realized at one point my eyes were open but I couldn’t see anything. I could hear her but had no idea where I was. She told me to stop tapping and I completely lost my shit. She gave me about two minutes to calm down then went right back to trying to process through how I would save the child, how would I rescue her, what would my safe people say if they walked in? 

I would never want anyone to walk in. Those memories are my dark hole. I’d never wish that stuff on anyone else. 

She led me through the wrap up stuff and remarked on how “anxious” I looked. No shit Karen. 

I literally feel a thousand times worse than I did before I started. I know trauma work is difficult, but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced a therapist deciding to use EMDR on their first or second appointment? I don’t feel I have the coping skills to process what happened today.

SuicideWatch,"WARNING: I'm gonna vent a lot about my family and it's gonna be edgy as hell because I'm disgusting and I hate myself. I need to tell someone out there about my life so maybe I'll be remembered by someone.

Everything I say and do seems slightly off to everyone else and I know it. I don't care what you say, the fact that I couldn't get through a conversation without excusing myself mid-sentence to harm myself in the bathroom so I don't start muttering the word ""carve"" over and over because I'm trying to drown out the rest of my thoughts isn't normal. I've never been normal and I need serious help. Help I can't get because I'm broke, and help I can't get because my dad would fucking throw me against a wall for even daring to ""threaten the safety of the kids"". 

I wish I could tell him what I really think. I wish I could tell him I knew he was lying when he said he never did drugs with my mom. He used to sell shit, and my mom got magically addicted. Hmm. Fucking fishy. I've read her journal entries from when she was in the hospital about how much she wanted to stop doing meth for her kids. She was pregnant with my unborn brother in the last entry. 

She's fucking dead and I don't want to point fingers because my dad must've been addicted too, but I wish he never got my mom involved. I don't remember much about her, but I remember making cookies with her one day. She wasn't very good at baking so it was just premade dough. I was 4 so I wasn't doing anything. Still one of the best memories I have.

I wish she was still around. I wish she could've lived and gotten off of the drugs. I wish she could find a way to repair her relationship with my dad and they could fix themselves together. I wish I had a normal family. I wish I could fill her shoes for my siblings. I wish I could talk to someone in my family, but they're either too young or would immediately go to my dad or extort me for some money to buy pot.

My dad tries his absolute hardest and I think that's the worst part. He was never meant to be a father and anyone with an IQ above room temperature could see it. He was abused himself, and by the age of 13 he was homeless. He never recovered, in part to his paranoid ideas about ""big pharma"" and therapy and how ""unhealthy"" it is to take meds. The other part was the, y'know, lack of money before he got to dealing drugs.

My oldest brother has learning issues. He literally watched his mother die (he's my half brother, his mom was my dad's first wife who apperantly died in a car accident but I've heard a million different stories). My mom wanted my dad to take my brother to get some sort of mental help but my dad predictably refused. Have I mentioned how much I hate my dad?

My other brother is an interesting person. He's a year older than I am. I still faintly remember him trying to do sexual things to me when I was around 5, which makes me think that maybe he was also being sexually abused by the babysitter we had at the time. Maybe it was his fucked up way of coping or maybe he was just born with a perverted mind. I don't think he actually cares about anyone in this family. He's stolen money from my little sister and brother, and every once in a while when I have money I give it to him in hopes he doesn't beg one of the kids for anything. He's the kind of person that would threaten to tell my dad about my self harm if he knew how desperately I was trying to hide it for money. I feel more hate for him than I do love and I'm ashamed to admit it.

I love my little brother so fucking much it hurts. He seems to enjoy it when people are in pain and it hurts to know he used to hurt our cats for the fun of it. He's gotten so much better now and I'm happy to see he's not hurting anything or himself. He's growing up to be strong yet sensitive. He's not afraid to be himself and I love that about him.

I love my little sister to the point I would literally cut off my arms just to make her happy. She's a beautiful young woman and she's strong. She's so innocent and every day I see her grow up in this shitty house it breaks my heart. She's the only one of us that isn't afraid of our dad. She's yelled back at him before. I want to help her grow up into the woman she wants to be. She's already seeing the worst of humanity and it doesn't tear her apart like it did to me. I would die for her.

Remember when I talked about the babysitter? He was my dads friend and he lived in our cellar because he was evicted or something like that. It was him and his brother. I can't remember much about the one in particular except a couple of really bad times that make me want to claw out my eyes and break my legs. I remember being forced to sit in his lap while he pissed himself. He smelt like beer and vomit and he kept pulling me back to his lap while I tried to run. I remember hiding behind a chair while he said something about buying me a ring because I really loved jewelry back then. I think he grabbed me by my backside and dragged me out but it's all so fuzzy. He was overweight and I'll never forget the sound of his weight against the floorboards as he walked up to my hiding spot. Unrelated but he gave my older brother (the one who always needs money) a chicken named Britney and my brother found immense joy in throwing her at me. It always scared me to see her feet because I knew she would scratch me when she landed.

Anyways, I'm sorry for spilling out my entire life story when literally no one fucking asked for it but I want someone to see that I existed I guess.

SuicideWatch,"I've been a long time Reddit lurker but never have posted.

I've decided to end my life. Depression has been a part of my life for a very long time, but it has come to an unbearable burden.

I'm in my mid 30s. I've been in 4 serious relationships and they all disintegrated in one way or another. Usually my fault, honestly... I had a lot of maturing to do. I learned and improved. I worked on myself. I took time off to heal.

My last ex i actually still live with. We have a beautiful home, dog, cats... my life isn't bad. I know people would kill for this. Depression doesn't care.

I fell in love the beginning of this year. A man came into my life who was experiencing heartbreak. We had a whirlwind of... whatever it was. He was out of a very long relationship and was very honest that he wasn't looking for a new relationship. But... he was sweet. Kind. Romantic. The perfect lover. It was easy to fall for him. 

We went away for a perfect weekend together. I was willing to wait until he healed. I wasn't in a rush. 

Then everything went to shit. One small misunderstanding turned him into an angry monster. There was no explaining anything... I was on eggshells ever since.

But I wasnt. Because fuck him. I said what i wanted and how I felt. The rollercoaster was exhausting. I could never do anything right. Story of my life.

He was activated by the ARMY the day after he told me he never wanted to speak to me again. I haven't seen him in 2 months. We've spoken. We played a game online together while he was away. But he was so distant. Our talks until 3am became one word answers. 

So needless to say it just spiraled my depression. I reached out to a therapist. I went to work every day. I tried to keep busy. But I was so sad. This story sucks, there's so much more. But I was at the end of my rope.

Then I lost my job. Of 9 years. My ""essential"" job. Where we just got bonuses and new insurance. Myself and the part timer temp. Not the guy who has been there for 3 months who happens to be best friends with my boss.

Anyway. I've lost my income. I've lost my insurance. I had to stop taking my medication because I can't afford it now.

I don't want to start over. I'm tired. I can't find another job with what I was doing. 9 years down the drain. I don't want to fall in love again. I don't have anything left to give.

SuicideWatch,"I don't know how many people going to read this, but I need to put it out there - stream of conscious style.

Mid 20s, female. I tried so hard. I made so many mistakes. Bruises, dirt on knee. I was a happy kid. I was extremely casual, love building things, watching TV, love life, love hanging out with friends like a typical elementary school kid. I ended moving at a young age. I told my parents not to, because the place they would go is not what I would call a home. Well, they have to bc of money.

I went from having the best time of my kid life (jumping out of bed to greet a new day) to hatching out my suicide plan in the same year. I didn't do it bc I used to had hope for life. Parents job was stressful.  I get verbally abused the moment they enter home. Been told they wish I was choked to death as a baby. Been told I should kill myself (I'm a middle schooler at this time). From those who should've cared. Lost trust. One of my male family member would come to my home and watch me when I'm sleeping and stroke my face. What a pleasant way to wake up. Another family relative said it's ""Ok, bc he is just your uncle.""

Confused. I dropped all my hobbies since I moved. Was too depressed and needed something more mindless. Ended up being a loner throughout HS.  My mind was messed up. I like to play out murder scene in my head to show my frustration (I never physically take out my anger, btw. I love animals). No one cared about my school or grades. It was the only thing I cared about bc I wanted to get out and go far for university. Made one of the top grades in my class. Got into university.  Top grades but majored in something I hate bc confused. Went to grad school bc didn't know what to do with my life. Made top grades but ended up hating it too (I thought it was ok when I entered). I realized the type of grad job I would have will very likely leave me physically injured and more.

Was the ""good kid"" type  (no party, drink, drugs). Just friendly and do what the teachers say without complaining type of person. I wanted a different life and I messed up on all levels. Yeah, I think I'm going to stop. I still have a lot of things to say but I don't want to take up your time. Yes, I'm grateful I get to go to undergrad/grad school.

I'm tired of the same old same old, think of the doctors!  Think of the ventilator you may take that someone else needs. Yes, but that's the whole point of healthcare.  We aren't prepared because it's about profits, old perfectly working equipment thrown out for the new, instead of repairing, spend spend spend mindsets everywhere.  There is no healthcare in our country.  Others were overwhelmed because they were caught by surprise.  We had plenty of time to prepare, but got caught behind blind double speaking politicians.  We could have kept the country open AND cared for everyone to the best of our ability.

I'm tired of waiting in line at a store while customers yack and yack to employees for 30 minutes straight, and then have to go to the ATM or something.  All the while the employee blocks anyone else from entering the store, for the sake of ""social distancing"" while an entire line of people waiting outside for this one customer who is unprepared.  They should make them go to the back of the line, so the rest of us can get on with life and get away from potential infection.

SuicideWatch,"23/m, undergraduate non-American engineering student.

I would rather not go into particulars, but this lockdown has been particularly bad for me, making me feel as if I am running out of options. I would like to preface this by saying that my problems are not economical/financial in nature and that although there is no immediate threat to my livelihood, I have been finding it more and more difficult to just keep up.

My anxiety coupled with depression ensures that I can't do anything I want to in my life. I feel like I have deep commitment issues. I feel like it's difficult to commit to anything: gym, GRE (somehow got a good score without studying much), projects, projects, learing something new like a musical instrument, coursera courses etc. I can't commit more than the first  two days for anything long term. Its like I am mentally paralysed. 

Every year, for more than half the year I feel as if I couldn't care less about living. Add that to the fact that I have nobody in my life that I can really ""talk"" to. I have trust issues with my parents, and sure I have friends, but I have always seen them as like-minded people to hang out with.

I have this morbid feeling that my time is near, even though I have a more than healthy fear of death. I just feel backed into a corner. There are times when I wish that I would jump from my second-floor apartment, I would probably not die, and only end up shattering my legs, which weirdly enough does not seem to be a bad thing. Other times I wish I would get a heart attack, and although it seems improbable at this age (I am not exactly obese), my heart does feel like it acts a bit erratically nowadays (probably gotta do something with how my anxiety and depression is at an all-time high nowadays).

And then, let's say I scrape through this particular episode, I am afraid that the next one will be worse. Am I to spend the rest of my life like this? What chances do I have of not smashing my brains in the next two-three years? What about when I turn 30? What chance do I have of making it to 50, or dying of old age? And even then I don't want to spend the next 40-60 years of my life like this. Sometimes I have lots of ambitions, and sometimes none.

I am 19 and finished school last year. I was hopeless about my life and severely suicidal for two years during this, with severe anxiety which prevented me from doing many things my peers were doing. I liked school because I hated home, but I was barely a person. I had told teachers this before and they did nothing to help me and overall treated me very badly and left me to suffer, not offering me advice or help when I was clearly too depressed to do anything but be on autopilot. I was afraid to admit I self-harmed and isolated myself a lot. Somehow I passed my a-levels in this state, though with poor grades. My parents were unhelpful and my mother bordered on emotionally abusive. I planned to kill myself at the end of year 13. I had a breakdown after school ended, tried to do so, but burst into tears when I realised I was so afraid and broken, and so I went to the hospital. I told them everything.

They sent me home with no comfort and said I would be called the next day for the crisis team. I attended the crisis team for 5 days where I got literally no support, only probing judgemental questions and patronization which made me feel worse. I discharged myself (the fact they let me go when I was so suicidal tells me they did not even care.)

I was so frightened and alone I did not know what to do. I had many other break downs, even went to my old teacher's house in a fearful state as I just wanted to escape home, but even she treated me badly and did not want to help me, since I was no longer a student so it wasn't her job to help me. She was the only person who had kept me going through school and was like a mother figure to me. I hated myself. A stranger found me wandering down the motorway and took me to the train station, talking me out of my suicidal state enough for me to get back home.

A few months later, I managed to ask school to help me apply for university, and I got an offer. I had another break down after that and upset the school with my pleas for help.

I could not tell you where my strength comes from. I still feel so destroyed inside and scared this will go wrong. I know no one will provide me with help or references, as my old school dislike me now, so I don't know how I will get a job or anything. My parents just want to get rid of me as I am a nuisance apparently.

I never planned to get this far or even be alive. I had tunnel vision and was acting out of survival instinct. Now I feel it could go either way... I could let the past weigh me down with despair or somehow carry on. I don't know how. I just want to leave home forever and be free of my pain, but it seems no matter what I did, I was going to suffer, I suffered even for suffering and I am just so angry life can do this to me. I want to be okay but it seems so impossible for me.",please help me feel some hope,t3_gnk8xd,1

SuicideWatch,"-I tried to post this on AITA but was told it's against the rules.-
So backstory, I'm 24 years old female and I still live with my parents and totally dependant on them financially. I live in Morocco and it's near impossible to get a job while in university. It is also probably impossible for me due to having EDS, Depression and GAD as well as a suggestion of a diagnosis for BPD and PTSD (I was abused as a child as well as an adult and have unhealthy attachments. But im still in the process of getting an actual diagnosis)
 My sibling is 13 and AFAB but they are extremely struggling with gender Identity, they've always been boyish and will have phases in which they would be very happy when people mistake them for a boy and then ones where they would be offended. We are also a very religious family. So due to that, during this quarantine times they have been researching about it and followed a few YouTube channels run by trans guys. My parents found out and since they don't speak English they couldn't understand the video but did understand what was going on specially since they were hinting at it for a while so they decided that LGBT YouTube is a bad influence on my sibling and that the way to make it right is to restrict they internet usage. The problem is they decided to restrict all of our internet usage, which made me quite livid. I'm suicidal and it's been worse with Ramadan and quarantine so I use the internet to distract myself by watching Netflix and YouTube. I have a 4g subscription but it's not nearly enough to last me enough. Well I tried to accept it for the first few days thinking they will end up returning to their senses and try to see how to help my sibling since while they are religious they aren't exactly extremely homophobic and transphobic and do actually acknowledge that our country should abolish they anti-LGBT laws.
 Well that didn't happen, I tried to explain to my parents my predicament and that I really can't deal with the internet ban which they completely ignored telling me that I should suck it up for the sake of the ""family"". I kept trying to explain and argue and well I get mean when I'm anxious which is not an excuse. What I did makes me an asshole but I started being manipulative in the way I was explaining my situation and trying to get them to see that they're hurting me more than I did and even simulated a panic attack (I get them so much that I can make one come by easily triggering myself). It didn't work. But after my sibling started online classes they allowed them to turn on the WiFi for only the time they are in class which meant that's also the only time I can download what I want which is not always possible since they have classes very early and I can barely wake up. My sibling would even tell them that it's unfair that I get to use the internet then and that I shouldn't be allowed. Turns out parents didn't tell them why the internet ban was in effect because dad was afraid to lose the relationship he has with them. 
 It comes to today, I asked my dad to let me turn on the WiFi for sometimes during Iftar and after only 20 minutes he started telling me to turn it off because my sibling was locked up in their room and it made me extremely mad and told them it's not my fault they are bad at being parents and that just because I'm a pushover doesn't mean they should totally ignore my feelings and take me for granted. (Which is true, he's a wimp and my mum is abusive af). I went to my room to cool off and he turned off the internet which made me fly off the handle. After a bit of a mean back and forth I went to my room and a huge suicidal feeling hit me and I took a huge dosage of my medication (not lethal as I found out afterwards but still bad since benzos are technically a drug) but still they didn't care. I sent my dad some pretty mean texts borderline abusive about how they'll be happy if I died since he knew I took the pills and did nothing. And he told me that he was also extremely depressed and suicidal, well I got mad at him and told him he was just manipulating me to make me feel bad about himself and that he will regret it once I actually kill myself by jumping off a building (I was just bluffing because I'm afraid of height and of actually not dying if I did as I already contemplated it beforehand). Well he started to punch himself and had a panic attack and it made regret my actions and not doing what they asked of me specially since I live with them and I'm financially dependant on him. So I'm contemplating apologizing and accepting whatever punishment they bestow on me. And I also think that I'm not entirely the asshole. So am I the asshole? Or are we both the asshole? And what can I do to rectify the situation since I can't find a job and therefore move out. Plus I have a lot of pets that need money for food and care. 
Ps: English is my third/fourth language so my grasp on it specially now that I'm quite high isn't the best. Specially punctuation. So I'm sorry if I don't make much sense.

I want to be human again. It's just not happening.

I don't want to end my life. But the thing is, I've been dead for years. Killing my body isn't really going to change much.

I have been diagnosed with **autism**. I have been expelled from school twice. The first time was because the first time I was raped it happened at school, and rather than investigate, they **expelled** us both. He was older and a lot stronger than I was. He was almost 16 and I was barely 13. I have been bullied badly throughout my life. A lot of it was about my weight. I was an **overweight** child. I became **underweight** but that's a whole other story. The second time I was expelled was because I told my social worker I wanted to kill myself and she told the school. Rather than get me help, they expelled me on the spot. I have a crippling **eating disorder**. I have no friends. Last year I became **codependent** on this Ted Bundy wannabe and he carved his initials and the word 'slut' into my legs. My body feels plagued. I feel disgusting. I just want to be normal.

SuicideWatch,"Hi, Reddit

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 12 grade ( last grade in my high school ) and I have 11 days left until my final exam and the problem is that I will definitely fail, the the must do first exam, I'm pretty sure I will pass second one but that doesn't matter too much anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

So ever since 2018 I realized I have no future I'm stupid, I can't study, I'm bad at math and other subjects so ever since then I knew when I get to 12 grade shit will be bad and it is since I live in a small town there is almost no job's and all the good ones or even most ones are gotten by connections. Another thing is that I'm physically weak and awkward and the only jobs I will be able to get are physically demanding ones and I simple can't even imagine how I would do them for 8 hours when I get tired so easily.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is I really don't want to commit suicide since I really want to learn new stuff on the internet, chat with my friends on discord and watch my favorite content creators on YouTube this actives make me the most happy and I honestly could go my entire life doing them.

&amp;#x200B;

But sadly I can't because I mess up my future by not studying and not taking shit seriously and I regret it but there is no time to do anything really.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came here to ask if anyone could justify me living or should I just die and hope for the best.

&amp;#x200B;

I really really really really want to just have a decent job I'm not even asking for really good paying one just decent one where I can prob stay there for long period of time or even until retirement but simply that is not possible.

SuicideWatch,"Hi, 25yo F here from Iowa, USA. Growing up, I have considered this a few times but it is growing bigger and bigger, my desire to end everything. These days it’s everyday, multiple times a day. But the only thing keeping me alive is the sole fact that if I ended my life, my mom would be completely destroyed. She has been through so much darkness in the span of my life time and I can tell she’s so so weak, mentally. I know if I were to end things, she would be destroyed, she wouldn’t understand my reasons.  And so the only reason I’m alive is for her sake. I couldn’t hurt her like that. But here I am, suffering everyday, this urge to end everything is growing everyday. I literally just don’t want to be on this earth. The bad things all around, in my town, in my state, in my country, on this planet, they suffocate me everyday, and I’m not powerful enough to change anything. From my life to others lives, I have no power to change it. I try so so hard to get better but I can’t see the light at the end of this hell hole tunnel. I don’t need comments telling me that there are people out there with worse situations than me, I know there are but this is my hell and I cannot get out of it.

It feels like I will never get over this, any time I get even a little bit of hope that I will I get pulled back into the cycle. I need to know for certain I am a good person and haven’t hurt anyone in some way before I can move on.. but this is impossible. My life feels unstable. I don’t trust any of my memories, I get anxiety that I have a whole string of terrible or disturbing things I’ve done in my life that I’ve somehow forgot about. It feels so real I’m terrified of my mind and (TW) I’ve been suicidal to the point of actually planning it out within the last couple of months. Then when I get to a moment of clarity this seems beyond crazy. I’ve had this for a few years and it’s been tough but I never imagined it could cause the pain that I’ve felt this year.  I honestly don’t know how to cope, I’ve literally broke down crying and said I need to be in a hospital or locked away but I’m not taken seriously. I have therapy once a week and take meds but it’s just not working enough. And when my thoughts aren’t centred around me, me being terrible, having a horrible illness, going schizophrenic, being a sociopath etc etc the thoughts are about the world. How it might not be real, how everyone’s perception is different so nothing really exists (?), how everyone might be secretly horrible and they just don’t have the guilt about hiding it. I feel bad even typing that as I know it’s not true but it’s so disturbing and isolating. I think my brain just bases this off of abusive events that have happened in my life, my therapist thinks trauma caused all this. I just want to get better I hate myself so much and I question all the time what if I don’t have Ocd and I’m just making excuses for being a bad person please does anyone have any advice or support

When I’m thinking clearly I don’t want to die. I never Want to die but a lot of the times I just can’t understand my mind and it feels like the only way or that I deserve it.

SuicideWatch,"Hi.
It is what it is, I've been wanting to and thinking of dying eversince I was 12 maybe? A long time, 12 is probably the first time I ""kinda"" attempted it, we have a two story house and I found myself standing over the edge of the balcony but my mom pulled me in, in reality I don't think the fall would have done the job but I was a kid and didn't know any better.

It was never because of my looks, social status, love life, family.. I mean none of it is perfect to me but I don't feel depressed about any of that... I have a very good life compared to others when it comes to these kind of things, I never cared about my looks had many great friends and never struggled(was bullied) in school either. I do however have a lot of issues with myself, I don't like many things about me and regret a lot of things I have done. 

I feel like when I was younger and a lot edgier, it had a lot to do with my hate for society and how the world works in general, the unbreakable cycle of it all that doesn't seem much appealing to ne. I would say it's still mostly that but being older I do kind of find it stupid and cringy, so much so that I can't tell about it to anyone because I feel like it just sounds so stupid and embarassing, and I just can't find the words to explain it in a way that I won't feel like someone will laugh at me. I mean I tried explaining it to couple of people and get it off of my chest, but they didn't really take it seriously or I just couldn't explain it properly, hell I can't even write it here and you are all strangers. I would always feel like I'm just being ridiculous, but at the same time feeling like it is really real to me. And people would even say things like ""don't be ridiculous"" or ""that's not a real reason to feel like that"" etc. 

I dunno I just thought I'd ask, I feel like that maybe I just don't have a drive to live or something. I feel kinda like a fraud, like people have so many ""better"" reasons to be like this and would love to have what I have and be happy with it but somehow it is not enough for me. I feel like one of those 14y old billie eyelash girls who are pretend suicidal, but I've been feeling like this for... 12 years now. And it's always there, when I'm waiting for a train, I'm thinking of jumping under it, when I see a knife I feel like cutting myself and being done with it. It's so normalized for me by now that I make jokes about this all the time but it is very real, I just feel like an idiot because I don't have a good reason to be like this yet I am.
It's kinda funny, because all throughout high school I really really didn't have a reason to feel this way, but I was still depressed and it's ironical that in university this delression caused me actual reasons so be like that, failing uni and such.

SuicideWatch,"I don’t know. Does that make any sense? Therapists always say “your parents did the best with what they had”, as if that makes it any better - can’t this justification be used if I were to kill myself? All of my issues are tied to how they raised me (or lack there of). I don’t want to use excuses - I know my life is technically in my control, and I truly wish that I could fix myself, but the fact of the matter is that their abuse gave me major cognitive dysfunction, and because of that I’ve been stuck for a long time despite doing all of the right things.

I’m afraid  I may end up hurting myself or other people. 

I’m sad oh so very sad. All my life (36 currently) I have been know as the “nice guy”. We all know the saying about nice guys finishing last well that’s completely accurate and the story of my life. It has effected my love life and social life but I can’t fix it. I get walked on, clowned on, used, made fun of,  overall just taken advantage of. I’m extremely shy, lack of confidence, I always say “I guess “ or “ i don’t know” and never just give a straight answers, overthink things so much i get a headache. Whenever this happens it’s like something comes over me I can’t explain it. Best way would be I get stuck in this autopilot type trance. I have done a lot and I mean a lot of research over my “nice guy” issue trying to figure out how to fix it but I just can’t. As far as I can tell it’s just comes natural to me to wanna be nice and please everyone else even if that means I myself have to be the sad one. I know what my issue is, I just can’t fix it. 

From what I can come up with is my sub conscience that is controlling all of that. I am programmed like a computer with my sub conscience hard programmed to be nice and avoid any type of conflict. Does anyone have any opinions on how to shut that sub conscience up and let me control my own mind? It’s so bad like I said that I don’t even know im doing it when I do. 

All my life I would just tell myself to calm my depression “that’s me I’m just always gonna be the nice guy and other people are just gonna have to get used to it”. This used to work I was never this sad. This last serval months I have been depressed far more than I ever have been to the point I have put a loaded barrel in mouth. If it wasn’t for my family. I do not want to leave them in that type of way. But I can’t go on no longer suffering and sad all the time.lt’s very hard to stay strong when it’s everyday.

SuicideWatch,"Hi guys. I’m doing an anonymous post because I don’t want people to know I’m on here asking this. 

I’m a girl in my mid 20s. I thought I had my life figured out. Went to university, the whole thing that people tell you to do. Even did a postgraduate degree. 

I do modelling on the side and a bunch of other stuff. Basically I live a polished life on the outside, but I actually hate my life. 

I quit my job before the world basically went to shit and went overseas for a little while. Now I’m back and living off of government support etc etc. I had other jobs lined up but they fell through. 

Every job I’ve had (except one) has ended in absolute disaster. I find it REALLY hard to relate to people at work, and I do get targeted at work by men (and sometimes women who get jealous?) and have had instances of sexual harassment and being pursued/stalked/bullied etc in the past. 

Some of my friends have started getting jobs and things now that some of the world is very slowly coming back to normal. And I honestly can’t bring myself to go get another shit job and go through the whole process again. Even looking at LinkedIn and things gives me HUGE anxiety. 

My love life is just REALLY weird. I’m in a long distance open relationship, and although I like the freedom that comes along with that and it’s all consensual, I feel very insecure about the future of it all. I haven’t seen my boyfriend in 3 months and it’s doing my head in. We talk everyday and he wants me to go see him. I haven’t because I don’t want to be alone with him and him to see how fucked up I’ve become lately, and that I won’t measure up somehow. 

I’m also pretty damn sure I’m in love with someone else from my past who now lives overseas, but who I might not see again for god knows how long. 

I just feel like I have nothing to offer the world anymore and that I have no future. It’s all mixed up and completely fucked. I sleep all the time because I’m too scared and overwhelmed to face what’s going on in my life. I’ve googled suicide - but I think I would be too scared to go through with it - and the guilt of leaving my friends and family behind is what keeps me from doing it. 

I don’t want to see a professional about any of this, I have had counselling in the past for other things that have happened, and none of it really worked. I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining or ungrateful for the things I have. I just kinda push this all down and pretend nothing’s wrong because I’m embarrassed, I just smile through it and lie to people so they don’t think I’m going insane or worry about me.

I kept reminding myself it wasnt my fault and it was okay and now I feel like a terrible person and everyone can see how terrible I am and I dont know what to do anymore.

My life is basically mostly gone. Most of my plants were destroyed... my dog which I spend months training to feel happy again is having anxiety because i couldn't protect her. I had to ask my step mom who only helped me because she could brag to my bio mom. 

and the only thing getting me through was telling myslef it wasnt my fault and that im not a horrible human being for letting evrything happen to my dog and for not keeping my stuff safe but evryone thinks im bad and i feel like they must be right and i dont know what to do anymore.

SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry, I'm about to vent my feelings. I'm not like everyone else. I didn't get abused as a kid, I didn't get raped or anything and Im still ending myself. My whole life I've been alone. Since elementary school I saw how fucked up the world was, all the events of that time, the wars, the people, my parents arguing and leaving me by myself until it was night because they worked so much and expecting so much for my future, so I woulsnt be like them. Im sorry I can't meet their expectations. No matter my grades, no matter how hard I tried they only talked about how I could be better, I can't remember them asking anything on how I felt about this. On top of this no one would talk to me at school, I was bullied and the teachers yelled at me, I don't even know what for. My family is religious and I thought myself to be too. I didn't hate it at first but my father being a pastor would drill it into my head, I knew the religion wasn't the bad part but recently when I tried to tell them how I feel, my life and all the other struggles I've been having he said to me ""If only you were more subservient to God, you wouldn't be like this"". It hurts, im so weak, I try not to be affected by my parents but that line hurts so much. My friends kept telling me to talk to my parents and school did and society did so much that for some reason I thought it would work. I wished it went differently, I wish they cared about my feelings, my emotions. Me as a human. Im so selfish, I just wanted someone to love me for who I am. Im so scared for my younger brother. I love him so fucking much Im afraid he will turn out like me. The only person who knew is a close friend of mine who I told a few days ago when she reached out to me. She's also Christian and truly believes I will stay live, she doesn't wave religion at me like a weapon but she has been talking to me when Im breaking down (like right now), she treats me no differently and holy fuck I want to tell her how much I've been in love with her for the longest time. June 30, thats when I become 18 and that's the day Ive decided on. Ive been spending my time tying loose ends but today when my mom came in and started yelling at me about alot of things I wanted to tell her to fuck off and what Im going to do but then suddenly she changed and was telling me how much she loved me and talked about my future and everything. Ive planned this for so long I put minimal effort into everything so im going to a community college and I didnt apply for any scholarships like that but when she was talking to me I couldnt tell her, Fuck.

Maybe my soul wasn’t suppose to be here and it was an accident and it’s not even in a sad way I’m not suppose to fucking be here and that’s just that.

I told myself two years ago the same exact sympathetic bullshit some day blah blah I’ll be living my dream life I’ll be happy in a year or so, we’ll that shit never happened and now I’m at my rock bottom I guess maybe I’m writing this for some subconscious reason to find a reason why I should fucking stay when I know I shouldn’t. Everything happens for a reason, I’m just one of those people that should kill themselves.

Idk what this post is really about.... maybe its a rant idk I just want to talk. I feel sick with anxiety and I just wish I knew for sure the \~200 pills I have would kill me because I'm hesitant. So... I'm just going to talk.

I'm not doing ANYTHING with my life. I also don't see my life really going anywhere anyways and I've already made peace with that. I know I'm going to die, I've just been waiting till I was old enough to get a gun but I recently found out I'll probably have to wait till 21 which is devastating news. I'm so impatient I just wanna go now. I don't feel good.

And not too long ago I was here after taking 30 out of 130 pills I had. Didn't die, just got scary high. lol. I hope 200 will work. Maybe this time I won't bitch out 30 in.

I wonder if I'd be a bit better if my social life wasn't so shit. I have 3 friends. 1... kind of cares for me. She's really sweet but our friendship is surface level and I don't wanna scare her. Another one is too caught up with their own problems and I'm always supporting them but I can't get them to talk to me much anymore.The last one is very special to me, but I don't know why. They don't care about me *at all* which hurts cause I have a bit of a crush on them. They talk to me more than the other two do though funny enough.I wonder if they would care if I killed myself. Probably not, but it's a nice thought. Also, I don't see any of these people in real life. Even before quarantine. I don't leave my home. Hm.

I'm so fucking angry I have to exist. I've been more angry than sad lately - which is good because I'm more dangerously impulsive when I'm angry.

When I started a new job that wasn't retail, I thought that I would finally be happy. When I met someone that I came to have feelings for, I thought that I would finally have someone that cares about me. But that's not what happened. I'm not important. I never was, and I never will be. I'm just part of the backdrop. I was stupid to think that I could have anything good in my life. Good things aren't meant for me. They're meant for other people. I don't deserve them. Hoping that things could be different only make the crash harder. It's inevitable. No matter how close I get to feeling some sort of relief, I end up crashing back down when everything blows up in my face.

I should be better than this. Other people have terrible circumstances and they're still coping better than I am. The things that seem impossible to me are so easily achieved by others. I feel like I'm defective, like there's something hanging over my head to make sure that I stay where I belong and stop trying to leave.

I feel like I keep falling into a pool. Sometimes I lose my balance and fall in. Sometimes I'm shoved in by others. I struggle to climb out, and it's embarrassing when everyone is watching. When I finally get out, I'm stuck in wet, uncomfortable clothes for ages until they dry, but then I just end up in the pool again. Sometimes my clothes aren't even dry when I fall in again. After a while, climbing out of the pool seems pointless. I'd rather drown than keep struggling.

I wish that things didn't always hurt me in the end. I wish that I could just get over things rather than going into hysterics over things that don't matter. I wish I didn't desperately cling to hope so I could finally close myself off and stop caring. I wish good things could survive around me, rather than wilting and slipping through my fingers no matter how gently I hold it or how hard I work to keep it alive. I wish someone would care about me for once. I wish that someone would take risks for me. I wish that someone would see me as a priority, or someone worth being around rather than just a distraction.

I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don't know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.

I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don't want anything to do with me or I don't want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.

I have been trying to find a place to live I've been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I've been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.

For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I've had tutors I've had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can't do that.

I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don't even have a game system so I can't even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It's been years since I've played a video game I can't afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.

I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can't do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can't even afford that. 

I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can't do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.

I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I've had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn't even be loved and no one would want to be with me.

I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can't keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.

All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don't ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that's it. but it feels like I'm trying to reach to live on Pluto and it's like it's trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.

I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can't do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can't do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.

SuicideWatch,"So, throwaway account here! I don't want my friends or family to find this post.

I don't know what to do.
I've been depressed for years and years, things are finally starting to get a little better, I hadn't been thinking of suicide as much lately. But I just got some news that has crushed me.

My dad has fibromyalgia and chronic-fatigue-syndrome/ME/CFS. He is bed ridden and VERY vulnerable during this lock down. Thankfully, my dad is a massive dick so I haven't been thinking about him. My mother, who is the world to me, got a call from the doctor. She has been feeling symptoms of these incurable illnesses and more for years and years. But she thought nothing of it. She thought it was a result of her doing alot of DIY and heavy lifting. I have seen how bad it can get through my dad. It slowly kills you basically, or leaves you bedridden and alone. He has mild symptoms, thankfully, but still needs carers three times a day and is bedridden most days of the week. He used to be a head chef but had to give his job up because of his illness. My mother went into debt, trying to care for her husband who couldn't do anything, who tried to refuse medication (which only made things worse), while juggling two boys and a part time job.

I'm quite mature for my age. I'm 13 years old. I've tried therapy and such but, after I developed a burning hatred for my father, I kind of stopped trying to help myself. My mother got a call saying that it's possible she had ME and fibromyalgia. She cried for hours and I had to not, I had to be her rock, when really I knew how fucked we were. I'm not old enough to work and we live together in a 2bed apartment. She's already struggling working part time for the NHS (Admin, not front lines), which is so dead, the department shouldn't even be open.

I'm scared. If she.. Dies.. Or is bedridden, it is literally over for me. She was planning going back to school and now she might not even be able to get up in the morning. I am literally crying and shaking, thinking about it. If I could work, take the massive weight off of her shoulders, I certainly would. But I am so useless. I can't do anything.

SuicideWatch,"I remember it vividly, but also in some way my memory is confused and fuzzy.

I remember going through the motions of the day like nothing was going on, while my mind was racing. I often found myself happy that the next day, there would be no more pain, no more loneliness, no more sorrow, no more battle between me and my head. I had lost. But I was also happy that I lost, because it meant I could finally move on.

I remember when my mum left the house at 3 p.m. with my sister and brother. I remember she was in a hurry, and that just as she closed the door behind her I realized that I would never see her again in my life. And she would never see me again alive. 

I would never be able to laugh at my little brother's puffy cheeks (he was 6 months old at the time). I would never be able to sit on the porch at 80 years old with my sister drinking tequila and gossiping about our neighbors.
And somehow, instead of sadness, I found it liberating. It's like nothing mattered anymore. I wispered ""I'm sorry, you'll get through this. I love you"" as I heard them get into the car. 
Just as I had imagined it, just as I had planned it, I was ready. 

I wasn't even able to cry until that moment, but even then I didn't cry out of desperation but out of relief. I thought seeing them for the last time would be hard. And it was. But it was over, and it would all be over soon.

It's for my sister and brother that I wrote the longest letter. I wrote to her about how she would be able to rise from the grief, to battle her demons, because the was stronger than me. I had failed. 
I wrote to my brother about how he will probably never remember his big sister, the one that now adores him so much, but that was not strong enough to stay in this world. I told them both that whatever happened, I was proud of them. I asked them to not be mad at me, and told me to please remember how I was until 14 years old, when it all started going downhill. I wanted them to remember me for what I had the potential to be. The smart kid, who always has her hands full of projects, the fearless one. But I was not that person anymore.

I hid everything under my pillow. All my codes for bank accounts and stuff like that. I had recently been able to gather enough money to repay my mom's car, which I intended to use to kill myself. 

I was going to see my boyfriend at 6p.m., which gave me a reason to grab the car, get really drunk before, and just drive it down an elevated road near my house. At first it would have seemed like an accident. One of my best friends died in the same street, in the same way, and my mom tried to comfort me telling me that at least it must have been quick and painless.

I took a shower. I let the hot water almost burn me, but I was too numb to even try to get it to a decent temperature. It was too much work. The razor blade that I had hidden in my shampoo that I told everyone not to use was calling me. But no. I wasn't going to allow them to find me bleeding out in the bathroom. It was too much work cleaning that up, and my mom always complained about how she always has to clean. I wasn't going to leave her like that, with a chore she hated.

I cut myself briefly. I even went a bit too deep, but nothing that would have killed myself. That's actually the only scar that still remains on my arm. A long one among all the short ones hidden on my ribcage. 

I got dressed. I sprayed my favorite perfume. I told my boyfriend that I was coming. 

And on that street, I wasn't able to do it. I didn't even try. There were too many people and honestly I don't even know how I was able to stay on the street, intoxicated as I was. 
I turned back. I called my boyfriend telling him I had forgot to close the door back home. On that same street, I was emotionless. I went back into the house, drank another two shots and was back in the car.

I wrote one last text to him, saying ""sorry, I love you"".

And then, boom. Black. Emptyness. 

I didn't do it. And I was so mad about it. But I had a backup plan.

At that point I had realized I couldn't wreck my mom's car and had just decided to cut my wrists while screaming my lungs out in the car. 

I went into my boyfriend's house bleeding. I only told him ""help"" before completely shutting down.

I woke up in the hospital, a day later, with him staring at me motionless the whole time. 

I remember thinking ""fuck"". As I woke up. Because I knew what would follow. Endless years of therapy. Endless nights spent crying on my mom's lap saying ""I wish it had worked, why did you have to give birth to me.""

I really wanted to come here saying that in these 3 years something has changed, that it got better. But the fact is that I still think of it every day. They never found the letters. I still have them and continuously update them with new info. 

Sorry for the rant, but it really is a difficult day today, and I thought I would just let you all know, that even though I can't assure it will get better, there's no rush. I know I will kill myself eventually. But today is not that day.","Today, May 20th 2020, marks three year since my first real suicide attempt.",t3_gn7577,1

SuicideWatch,"I had to post this. I just came back from minutes of sleep paralysis after having weird nightmarish dreams about whatever. Then whenever Rick from Rick and Morty would say “Freeze Frame” I’d be frozen only barely moving for who knows how long

It was pretty interesting though. I don’t remember what led to this part but I was stranded on a red planet with never ending asteroid rain. Rick called it anticipation as in never ending even though I don’t think that makes any sense now that I’m fully awake. But it seem to make sense when I was dreaming. I was traveling far to see someone I’ve been messaging on Reddit right I’m front of me when a huge asteroid hit in between us and all that. I escaped with Rick and Summer. 

Then when Rick was explaining the constant meteor shower the sleep paralysis began, I was awake but couldn’t move, Rick would say “Freeze Frame” saying jug would freeze me for ten seconds but it actually did freeze me in a state of paralysis. It was like I could make myself frozen with my mind. I couldn’t escape.. it was so terrifying

I tried screaming but I couldn’t. I tried thinking about other things but it was like my mind was trolling me.. like an internet troll took control of my brain and kept fucking with me

Then when I fully woke up at last I hyperventilated for 30 seconds before opening my phone to post this.. 

I’ve finally gone crazy you guys.. I’ve finally lost my mind

The suicide MUST BE DONE

I can’t do it anymore. I fucking hate my life

I don’t know if this has some type of meaning.. I’ve never dealt with this before

Obviously I know it was because I drank coffee today and got anxiety from it. As well as my left hand being numb from having carpal tunnel on it due to lifting weights a few months back (yeah “working out” really helped guys..) so maybe that had something to do with it

I’m honestly not sure if I’m depressed or not because I’ve never been diagnosed. Especially in an Asian country, where having depression is basically taboo or your family doesn’t want to have anything to do with you if you get diagnosed. 

I basically feel like my parents don’t love me at all. They only love my elder brother. Because he’s smarter than me. They’ve always compared me to him and I always feel inadequate. 

I help around the house, I do the laundry, cook, clean but to them I’m just a lazy slob. 

I cry myself to sleep almost every night because I’m so tired of living. Sometimes I feel like I want to commit suicide because I feel my life isn’t going anywhere. I’m 22 but my mother always says when she was at my age she’s already graduated from university and has a job. While I’ve just started University. She keeps saying I’m slow and stupid. 

Not to mention when I got tattoos and my parents found out (back in 2017) my dad slapped/ kicked/ punched/ strangled me. Because of tattoos. He says only prostitutes get tattoos. I wanted to kill myself that day. My mother saw everything happening but never stopped him. When my dad just beat my brother, she would put herself between the both of them physically. But for me?

I wanted to call the police but she said I would be “breaking up the family”

Ok so a few things, This may be a long one but idk so fuck it... as I'm sure some of you may know this is hard to explain, I have been suicidal in the past, 3 times to be exact from the ages of 11 to 12 (currently 13).

I'm good with lists so let's start with one detrimentally scarring problem at a time. This first one comes from my dumbass getting lucky/unlucky at the genetic lottery and my balls dropping from grade 5 - 6 over the summer break. It was cool at first, I got to scare the shit out of some of my mates by sounding like I was 18 looking like I'm 15 and I'm at the height of an average 16-year-old so yea lol. Then comes the shitty part, the feels. the reason being is that having feels for a girl for about a year and knowing she isn't mature enough to have the same feelings sucks balls. It was grade 6 so we where doing the whole experimenting with dating thing, of course, that's a popular kids game, and me being the introverted Lil dipshit I was there is no chance in hell. I got to be friends with her for a while then I blew it by sticking to her like glue for a bit and making the dumbass decision of trying to buy her out (waste of over 100 bucks of lunch money lol). Ended up confessing didn't work out I was fucked for a while, didn't help I got into anime at the time and I get too engage in that type of shit and being the hormonal bastard I was broke down even more. What's even sadder is that I got so emotionally invested in that girl I haven't hade the same feelings since, excluding making decisions with my dick.

Numero 2, all of my 5th-grade life lol. This is when I was most suicidal, being the weird kid at the time. For some reason being invested in video games is weird, that and having a big forehead, and being in the unpopular crowd. This one is pretty basic, I got bullied a shit load and that lead me to not having a reason to get out of bed. thought of suicide twice nearly did it once (if you're looking for details I tried to hang myself by my fancy-ass school uniform tie, my lack of vision when crying saved my life probs. But trying to do it in the school bathroom was also a pretty good point in favor of me writing this now)

Going even more back in time to when I was like 5, parents got divorced. pretty self-explanatory, home life was complete shit from then on with arguments going back and forth. when it comes to financing in the family, one parent says this another says that. With me trusting them equally it tore my mind to fucking shards. That and I only see my dad every 2 weeks for 2 days, it sucks. Because of this, I have grown to fucking hate my mother to my absolute fucking core, she can be an insensitive cunt sometimes. Some such comments as; your hair look gross we should cut it (i like my hair), your pimples look so raw put makeup the school will send you home and the list continues. it fucking hurts and I'm less and less trusting of my mother now which is sad, but I mean she is my fucking mother like she is supportive of my decisions (when they line up with her ideas). She buys me stuff too and I'm holding back calling her a cunt because of the reasons listed above because I feel it will make me a horrible person. I mean the woman put me through school and I have a house over my head and a decent gaming setup lol. But its roots back to the saying money can't buy happiness... or love for that matter.

continuing to a little more detail into my home life I have an autistic brother of which sometimes I want to punch the living shit out of (In a kind brotherly sense lol). but I mean he can't control it so I'm forgiving of him, he is extremely embarrassing in public which sucks but I rarely go out in public with him anymore. He is probably the main financial strain on the family with most schools not treating him correctly (and thus him doing a bad thing and not getting into any other schools), he needs expert help which I can understand. But it also means I can't go outside with friends almost ever because we have to take care of him. He has meltdowns which sometimes takes me off doing even basic online stuff with my friends so yea, I'm not gonna say anymore cuz if he wants to write on the internet and tell everybody he can and so be it, it is his personal life to after all.

Another thing is me fucking hating my generation but not in the old man's sense. It is sometimes as if they all have the same douchie personality as nobody is unique... some of my closest friends I feel as if they barely know me because I have to hide all that shit or considered to become an outcast which I really hate because I know they will accept me. I haven't found anybody that I could chat with for hours on end with since the 5th grade. that friend is now an extremely toxic cunt and in a different school so I ended up cutting it off, sadly that was kinda the glue that holds my primary school friends together even if there where only 3-4 of us lol. The last time I felt as if I could hold a conversation with someone like that was in a type of care group they did with the new 7th graders where they introduced us to some year 10s if we had any questions about the school so yea. It was 2 people, one ironically being the first loves older sister and one of her friends. We hade the same sense of humor and liking for anime and manga so yeah.

if you read all the way through to here thanks for listening to my privileged lifestyle of which sometimes I feel like the poor kids in Africa more contempt with themselves as a hole than me (over-exaggerated joke... at least I think) thanks for listening if you have any advice for me all help is appreciated.","I pretty sure dark times are coming again so fuck it, gonna break down to a bunch of strangers :)",t3_gnctgq,1

SuicideWatch,"I posted here many moons ago. I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation for many, many years. It's gotten better slowly, meaning life has become more livable and I've accepted it for the most part. I know I have a lot to be grateful for. I have a family, and though they don't fully accept me being a lesbian and act like my girlfriend of 5 years doesn't exist, they still show me love. I have an awesome younger sister. I have two amazing little puppies, and my gf is wonderful. I'm currently between jobs, but I'm finally working in the area I like, which is lab work. I got myself there by lots of schooling, debt, and work. No help from my parents, all on my own. Even though I have paralyzing anxiety and was never taught any adult life skills by my parents, I've managed to make a decent life for myself. I even finally started meds for anxiety a couple months ago and they have helped with that some. 

But, even after all these years, I often find myself still feeling like it's all not worth it. Like I shouldn't even be here trying. Like I'm faking my way through it. Just putting in as little effort as I can to have some kind of a life resembling what I imagine my happy life might look like. But I just feel like I'm walking around dead, or in a flat, dream world. Like I'm in the matrix waiting to take the pill and wake up. I feel like everyone would be better off without me. I have no real friends, and my family barely shows any interest in me. My girlfriend is great but I feel like she could do so much better than me. I just don't see a good future for me here. If there is an after life I feel like that's where I belong. Like, I just don't feel right here, and I don't know if I ever will. 
I'm probably one of the few people I know that is glad we all die eventually. I guess, I should just keep pressing on until my day comes, but it all feels so pointless, hard, and sad. Life sucks. All kinds of life. I don't see anyone truly happy here.",Hi friends,t3_gn6tq7,1

SuicideWatch,"All I think about is killing myself but I can’t talk to this about anyone. I kinda hinted at it to my therapist and she immediately forced my mom to take me to the ER. That was a couple months ago. I stopped therapy and seeing my psychiatrist because I was kinda angry at my therapist for doing that. They basically said “we can’t help you” and kinda gave up on me so I just went cold turkey on treatment. 

I was expecting things to get worse, but honestly they just stayed the same mostly. So much for treatment... I’m done with it. I’ve been through it all: inpatient, partial hospitalization programs, intensive outpatient programs, therapy, psychiatry appointments, meds, everything(except for residential). I just haven’t been getting better and it’s been years. I’m so tired.

I’d talk to a suicide hotline, but last time I did, they sent the police to my home so I’m not doing that again. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone without them locking me up in a psych ward.

I’ve already been to the psych ward and hospitalized for depression multiple times. I don’t want to go through that again. Everyone says I should go back to the psych ward, but honestly screw that. I refuse. I’d rather die. If I go back, it’d be like the 10th time. 

I haven’t been doing my schoolwork either. I’m so behind. My mom wants me to at least take the GED test, but I heard it’s not as good as an actual diploma. I don’t know what to do.

So I've always been kind of shy, and socially anxious. In school I usually had a few close friends, and that's it. About 2 years ago, I noticed that I started feeling self aware around my friends, which didn't happen before. This started to get worse and worse, to the point where when I was around my friends I constantly felt self aware and didn't know what to talk about. I also started feeling very empty and depressed, which resulted in a suicide attempt a year ago. Now, another year later, the situation has worsened even more. Now, even around my family I feel strange, every second of the day I feel self aware. My family feels like strangers, like I have no connection to them at all. I can't have a conversation anymore, my memory is terrible, and I've lost all my friends. The feeling of loneliness is indescribable, i feel like i haven't talked to another human in years.

SuicideWatch,"I really really don’t want people to worry about me, or feel responsible when I die. I get sick all of the time already; over the past two years or so, weird stuff keeps happening to my body (from seizures to horrible chest pain to whatever else) and so like... would it be too far off for me to just get sick and die randomly?

Like, what if I just look a slightly above toxic levels dose of meds every day, and then all of a sudden dropped when it built up too heavily in my system. Or what if I stopped eating, and wasted away that way. I’m supposed to be over this time period in my life. I don’t want people to think I lost against suicide, but I am currently losing. It sucks. I’m embarrassed. I just want to disappear. I feel so fucking guilty.",I just want to kill myself slowly enough that nobody notices it was intentional,t3_gn62lu,1
SuicideWatch,"things have seemingly gotten worse for me during quarantine, the busy work fucking assignments keep coming in like there’s no tomorrow. but granted, things already kind of fucking sucked before that. not particular reason i guess, i have a stable friend group and although they frequently ignore me, it’s way better than nothing. i have a healthy relationship with my family aside from my father and brother. 

but it just seems that even though the messages are piling up, i still feel alone. i seem to find myself in the same spot every day. i have an extremely unproductive day in which i tell myself, “i’ll get to it another day” knowing that i never will. then night comes and everyone’s asleep, and suddenly the feeling of emptiness and loneliness comes back. no more distractions. just more time to get lost in my thoughts. 

no, nothing necessarily bad has happened to me. bad as in traumatic. i haven’t been r@ped, assaulted, etc. but i still feel so fucking awful. i cant seem to find one fucking thing that can fill the void in my soul even after constantly talking to various boys at a time. male validation is starting to become less “validating” for me. 

that being said, i feel like a background character in my own life. i wake up every day having to initiate conversations with people or else we wouldn’t talk. i have a therapist, but sometimes i feel like she needs more help than i do. 

there are people who love and care about me, i know that, but do i? actions speak far louder than words, and theirs don’t seem to match up. every passing day i find myself feeling more alone than the day before, despite the fact i have people who care about me beyond measures. it just doesn’t fucking feel like it sometimes. 

so why the fuck do i feel like such a burden? what even is the point of being alive if were all going to die anyway. none of this is going to matter sooner or later, everything will just dissipate. 
i have no interests to distract me. i do no sports. i have no hobbies. 

dear god, i really would end it all of i didn’t have an unrealistic fear of the afterlife. 

but at the end of the day, all you have is yourself to trust. everyone leaves whether you like it or not. marriage is a load of shit and so is the concept of even fucking being alive.
