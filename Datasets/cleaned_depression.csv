depression,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",t3_doqwow,0

depression,"I feel like everything has lost it’s „point“ to me because everything may it be an ambition like drawing, music, movies, games are tied and related to the bigger life, your goals, career, family, graduation.

You have it easy and your situation and stress is a mere joke. I mean I get that - he’s quite right there. 

But I just can’t find a way to feel unstressed, depressed and anxious. Maybe I shouldn’t be and it feels dirty to feel depressed when I have more than them.

depression,"I feel down and depressed throughout the whole year (because of school and expectations, mostly) but in summer it just gets worse. I’d say there’s a few factors that come into play here;

First, school is finishing and I’m stressed about getting my grades right. I’m expected to have straight A’s since I’m “really intelligent” and because I should stick out from the rest. I understand this(somewhat) but think that it’s not worth the unnecessary stress and I think that my mental health is more important than my social status(my mum specifically, thinks that I should not be in the same group as the others since I’m “much smarter”). Here, where I live, you can go to whatever school you want with half the stress and struggle. (This needed a lot of explaining lol)

Second: People start going out,(the quarantine is a lot looser now) you see a bunch of people with friends and dates, going out and having fun. And then there’s me, socially anxious and insecure guy with like 2 “kinda friends” I sometimes hang out with(I had a few more before but I got ditched, or I ditched them because they were being assholes to me). When I do go out, I might see a cute girl and think “Maybe I could ask...”. Something stops me. I start thinking about my social anxiety and depressing thoughts such as “Yup, I’m gonna die without ever going on a fucking date”, and my previous negative experiences, like girls straight up calling me ugly(you can just pretend like it doesn’t hurt). And obviously, I get sad, it just doesn’t go away. 

Third: I think this is really important here as well. I’m still in puberty and spring and summer usually come with a lot of hormones and chemicals being released (not a scientist, I guess it just makes sense). A great topping for a greater depression lmao.

PS: Mental health here isn’t addressed at all and nobody gives a fuck.

depression,"So this girl made me fall in love with her through quarantine. We couldnt meet because lockdown nd that but we dm'ed all day everyday and often called for several hours. She told me she wants me a loves me for weeks, sexted me' sent nudes and stuff and i reciprocated of course. I spent almost all my time talking to her. I was going to bed at 3am coz i was talking to her and id wake up at 6am to go to work at 6:30am. Id text her whilst at work on my smarwatch or would take like 10 toilet breaks a day. And when i got back i just talked to her. My days off i talked to her all day. All ive done in quarantine is eat, sleep but barely, work and talk to her or play games with her. I found out 2 weeks ago that she had a bf. He messaged me on ig. Why tf did this have to happen to me. Im 21, i have depression but i keep it to myself, only thing that really spills over irl is cognitive dysfunction. Ive never had a gf before and im a virgin lol. I used to be a jim rat and was jacked and still am in great shape. Im not the ugliest mofo out there (im not blowing my own trumpet here in the slightest btw) and im clean and dress well and stuff. So i dunno why this has happened im also a virgin loool. So for like the first month of this relationship i wasnt sure if it was real. I couldnt believe someone actually loved me and was saying they liked these things about me that no one had said to me before (i actually have a post about this like a month ago, lol it was short lived). She made me feel special. I remember one time she called me her so (significant other) and i was kinda suprised by that, like damn i didnt know thats what u considered me. And then i started to relax about it. I trusted that what she told me was the truth. And i had noooo reason not to believe her. I was on cloud 9. I had mad butterflies for her all i wanted was quarantine to be over so i could go see her. And then on her birthday it turns out it was all lies it was all fake. Like wtf. Its a complete mindfuck. Why would someone play me like that, whyyy? I did nothing to her but give her all my attention and love her. And she made out she felt the same about me. I feel like a clown. I had never felt this strongly about someone before. And it was fucking fake, it was all fucking lies. When i found out i was throwing up it just turned my stomach. If she was lonely and afraid id stop talking to her she could have played along as us just dating. But shes the one who started all the sexting and sending and askin for nudes and telling me she wants me and want me in her bed and she wants to sleep with me and everything else. Yes i was the first one to say i love you. But she texted back after the call i love you too. I told her she didnt have to say that because i didnt think she did, and she assured me that she does and started saying ut first. FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

\*Self harm trigger warning\*

So I graduated from grad school a few weeks ago, and it's still kind of surreal. Celebrating during this time has been almost anticlimactic, but damn I feel good knowing I am fucking done!

And as the warning suggests, looking back, my first year of grad school was ideal for a few weeks. I'd go to the gym and be happy after that. (I cut a decent amount during senior year, but not during the summer, so I was drinking heavily but not cutting). Definitely it changed soon and I was drinking heavily every night, wanting to die--a theme from late undergrad. I cut in undergrad but was fine until about October of that second semester of my first year of grad school, until that July. The combination of my drinking, anxiety, and classwork really took a toll on me. 

So, I'm still in progress. I still drink a lot, and yeah, I wanna change it. But, I haven't cut since last July, and before November. I don't want to die all the time anymore. I might have moments but they are fleeting. I used to have entire days where my main thought was me dying. 

And trust, there have been moments where a sharp edge was imagined real nice.

depression,"\*Throwaway since... I don't know...

I'm sitting in my living room, coming off the most successful week I have had in the last 6+ months. I started my new job after half a year of barely getting by. Now, I finally can slow my brain down and realize how utterly depressed and lonely I have been. 

Little backstory - 6 months ago I was kicked out of the military for pissing hot. During the lengthy legal battle, I didn't talked to anyone about it since I was ashamed of myself and also since I thought no one cared about my situation.  I took one week off and was right back to work as a low wage delivery driver,  while trying to find a job that suited my previous experience. During these months, I didn't understand that I was beyond depressed and hated my situation. All my daily concern was to try find a better job, and ensure I put in enough hours just to pay rent and legal bills. These months were just about survival, without any kind of support net. 

Now, for once I feel proud of myself of working hard and proving my worth to be promoted but I have no one to express my joy to. My old Army friends have ghosted me, and asking my old hometown friends to do a virtual happy hours has been delayed for weeks now. I know this story is a bit messy, but this wave of repressed and current depression hit so hard today that I can't bottle it up anymore. No one was with me during my legal battle, no one cared to help during the transition when I got the boot from the army, so now I just think what is the purpose of all this? 

Tonight, a large thought that has been clouding my head is if I suddenly just vanished, how long would it take to someone to notice and who would it be first? For sure it wouldn't be my parents since we only speak about once a month and I just called them today. Doubt my friends since a text reply back seems hard these days even with COVID. I came to the conclusion that it would be my employer since they're the closest form of interaction I seem to get these days.

My mother couldn’t explain why I would be depressed since I grew up privileged, even though most of my childhood was spend without her since she lived in another country while I stayed with my grandmother. A lot of memories of her are combined with my first panic attacks, because she used to scream all kinds of profanities at me when I forgot to clean something in the house, followed by long rants about how I should have been an abortion and am only alive because her mother wouldn’t allow it (She got pregnant with 17), that she knew I hated her and tried to hurt her on purpose and that I could go die in a ditch for all she could care. I remember at some point snapping so hard that I just started screaming and banging my head against a wall to make her stop yelling at me, and stop hearing anything until I blacked out and woke up covered with blood because of a laceration. I called a friend to get me to a hospital. It needed to get sewn with three stitches and I still got the scar, and she still insist I did it for attention and to show everyone what a horrible mother she was. 
Well ever since my siblings are born, she did a 180° degree turn around and became the ideal mother. She was patient, made lunch for them, always drove them everywhere and never screamed at them. I was 15 when my little sister was born, since then my mother also changed her behavior with me. She would yell less, and be less aggressive, especially since my sister started hugging me and crying if she screamed or hit me. It got to a point where she would stop entirely, and now everyone who sees her would not believe this jam-making lovely elderly Asian woman used to make me want to kill myself rather than going home after school. I‘m thankful that my siblings will never remember anything of this about her, and I know people can change for the better, but if I’m honest I’m...not. 
I feel worse since my mother became a better person, because I know it’s because of my siblings. She used to be horrible with me, she forgot me on a train station because she was drunk, I was once molested because she left me over night in a city I didn’t know, she almost killed me when she left me inside her car on a hot day while she went to visit a friend...the lost goes on and on, but now she‘s become the guardian angel mother type who always listens and loves her two children ever so dearly. I can’t even say she did all this because she‘s a horrible human being. I can’t say it had nothing to do with me because that‘s just the way she is. She clearly always has had the potential to be a great and caring mother, just not for me. She didn’t wanted it to be for me. 
I‘m glad that my siblings won’t feel how I have felt, but everything feels so much worse now. 
I‘m depressed since my early childhood, and she has never wanted to see the signs or linked it to her behavior, to her I was always just „crazy“. I very clearly remember having to talk to my school‘s principal about my struggling notes in fifth class and him looking into my eyes and very sincerely asking: „Are you having problems at home?“. It was so hard to just say yes, and afterwards I cried so hard because I realized I am not okay. 
The reason it all came up now was because I was watching the anime „Erased“ with my bf on Netflix, and there‘s a scene where a girl is invited by the child protagonists mother, who makes her breakfast and she has a flashback to her own mother who used to cook, then only put some instant noodles, and then just some money for her on the table, followed by the girl crying because the mother of another child was more caring than her own. That scene got me SO hard, because I had that exact scene in my childhood when I was 6 and having a sleep over with a friend. After that I wasn’t allowed to have sleep overs any more. 
I cried for a long time and my bf tried to calm me down and in the end just hold me and made me something to eat, and I realized that no matter how much I cried, the person I’m crying about won‘t care and it‘ll only worry the people that love me.

I think back in the day, in the first stages of my depressive episodes in my teens, I'd do what many do and listen to the saddest, rawest stuff I could find and sob and scream the pain away. It used to feel good, even at my lowest points. Not any more though.

It just hits me with nostalgia and bitterness and anger. I'm ""technically"" a musician (categorically speaking I make music, whether it's quality is debatable), so there are weird pangs of jealousy and self-hatred that I can't do what I'm hearing. There's also the general emptiness I feel that I don't WANT to, so I avoid it. Music, especially GOOD music, hollows me out and brings me back to That Place I don't wanna be.

He's way too troublesome for some reasons. We started to argue a lot. He tried to push me but I didn't leave on his side. I knew he was suffering but despite that, he still tried to make himself funny and make out a bunches of pun.

I simply have no plans or whatsoever"". 

It was three years ago. He begun to online for daily, for the things he couldn't comprehend. Until we met through a random post in otaku community. I was messing up the comment section and he was a toxic for replying dummy stuffs. And days had passed by for him and it gotten worse. The nagging and peer pressure that they often compared him with someone else. He reached out his red line. He didn't do a thing. He blocked all of us, the important ones. After that, he decided to use his other account and got stuck in rpw.

He said these.

""Despite my current knowledge in medicine, I wasn't able to understand what going on with him.""

depression,"This isolation due to Coronavirus has really brought out my depression and it has made me notice something my brain does when I'm depressed.

My girlfriend knows I struggle with depression somewhat and, though she does not have it herself, is very attuned to when it is strongly affecting me. However, whenever anyone asks me why I'm sad or anxious, I can always come up with a reason.  

""Oh, school's just really tough right now, I haven't seen my friends for a while, I've just been couped up inside all day and need to get out"" Whatever it may be at the time, it feels like I can always find a justification for my overwhelming sadness and lack of activity. But I really think that it's just my brain trying to come up with some other reason to explain it that makes more sense than ""I'm just really fucking sad today."" In fact, current situations aside, the depression is usually the cause for the things that I use to justify it!

depression,"Hi everyone. I just received a diagnosis of depression, along with OCD and GAD, two days ago. 

I wasn’t at all surprised by the OCD or GAD since I got an OCD diagnosis a few years back and have always had anxiety issues. But the depression took me aback.

It’s starting to finally make sense to me why I have not been able to derive any sort of happiness or pleasure out of things I used to enjoy. I knew that I was dissatisfied with my life, but I never made the connection to depression. I always assumed that the obsessions and compulsions of OCD were the only cause. Now I’m starting to get it. Even before the pandemic, I rarely wanted to make plans with people. It always felt like too much work. I’m always tired and often feel empty. I sleep way too much during the day to make up for the insomnia I deal with at night. I’m realizing how negatively this has impacted all of my relationships and I’m surprised that my fiancé has stuck around to deal with me. I’m surprised I have any friends. The irony is that almost no one I know would suspect that I deal with what I do. I am known for my “energetic” and “positive” nature at work, and people know me as being happy and making everyone laugh.

depression,"i'm going to do my best to give context briefly bc i don't want to this to become a rant haha (ok i'm looking back now and i definitely failed in this regard. sorry for the long post). i don't have a good relationship with my parents, especially my mom. she's extremely verbally and emotionally abusive and i have a lot of trauma and bad memories tied to this house. i was not a ""bad kid"" at all and i basically didn't have any close friends until the last year and half of high school bc my mom would never let me leave the house or talk to anyone. she was very helicopter-y and whenever i didn't behave exactly as she wanted or didn't perform academically the way she wanted she would harass me for the entire day. this was extremely unbearable for me bc i felt like i had no where to run to and no one to confide in. i started self harming in middle school and it got very bad in high school. when i told my dad i was depressed and suicidal my mom told me to go ahead and kill myself and that she wouldn't cry at my funeral (it sounds so absurd when i type it out). they refused to let me get help bc they don't believe in mental illness. 

being depressed definitely affected me academically. i felt empty and couldn't motivate myself at all and i didn't do as well as i wanted in the last few years of high school. my parents don't believe in mental illness so they didn't take it well at all. when i didn't get into a college they liked i think they sort of internally disowned me lol. when i came home for winter break and asked my mom why she was ignoring me she said something like ""youre just an intruder here maybe if you'd gone to X University i would treat you like a guest""(idk translating is hard). 

now that i'm home my mom is ignoring my existence and hasn't spoken a word to me. it's low key pretty impressive how well she's doing. but it really hurts me when i step into a room and she immediately leaves like she can't stand to be within 5 feet of me. and i feel like she's trying to isolate me in the family bc whenever i get along well with my dad she ignores him too and refuses to eat dinner (at the table with me there) and starves herself. so now i don't talk too much with my dad and i make small meals for myself bc i don't want to ruin their relationship ship too. whenever they do family activities with my younger brother i don't participate bc i know my mom will leave and i'd spoil the mood. i've relapsed im self harming since being clean all though college. i just don't know what to do. i know my situation is definitely not the worst since i'm still a fairly privileged twat but i feel like such shit everyday and i don't have anyone irl that i can burden with this. i can't sleep at night because i dwell on my failures and think about how much i suck and drown in loneliness. sometimes i feel like my issues could be solved if i just got a hug lol. the most uncomfortable physical part is whenever i'm awake my chest and throat area feels super tight and heavy that i can't stand up. and i don't know how to make it stop or distract myself. i don't know what i should do",I'm back home from college since my university kicked us out bc of Covid last month and i haven't felt like such shit since the last time i was home in high school,t3_goyzkm,0

This has allowed me to move on from the thought process that thinking about suicide makes me a bad person.

As well as giving myself a pass on thinking about suicide ive accepted that suicide will probably be the way i die and if i die one day i want it to be on my own terms, weather that be in one years time or 30 thats ok and its a relief and a weight off my shoulders. 
Its made day to day life wayy easyier and i have managed to slowly reduce my reliance on antidepressants (down to 5mg instead of 20) as well as when i feel down accepting that im allowed to feel like this as its my life and nobody else has to understand why im sad nor do i have to justify my actions for it to be ok, all that i need is myself

depression,"Smoking weed once ruined my mental health. Been straight edge for 6 years.

Smoking weed once ruined my mental health.

Intro:   I am currently 20 years old, and six years ago I smoked a lot of weed and completely freaked out. Ever since that night, my life has completely changed.
———————————————————————
Anyway here’s me story. 

Background:   Growing up my dad, sister and all my cousins smoked weed and I was introduced to it by them. After hearing all these cool things about it I decided to save up some money to buy some myself. 

The night my life changed:

Fast forward six months I finally got enough money for an eighth. I had paid my sister some money to get it off one of her friend’s. She gave me the bag and we smoked that night. I didn’t feel any effects. 

The next night I wasn’t planning on smoking but it seemed like a perfect night. My mom was gone, my dad was working the next morning so he was in bed early and my little brothers we upstairs sleeping. I texted my sister, she told me where the stash was, told me to be careful and hung up. I got the weed, packed a really big bowl (about a gram), and smoked it all by myself. 

The effects hit. 

I immediately felt the urge to run to my bed after 5 minutes of smoking it. I couldn’t move at all, my mouth was dried out completely, my ears were ringing super loud, my heart was beating out of my chest and my head absolutely killed. At 14 years old I was truly convinced that was gonna be the last night of my life. Memories of my childhood ran thru my head, then like a movie, was my family crying at the scene of me dying and my funeral.  I always have known you cant die from weed, but I was convinced it was over for me. I was having a full blown panic, anxiety attack.

All these weird things kept happening, and after about 20-30 minutes things stated to get better but my head really, really hurt.  I was still nervous because my heart was beating fast and my mouth was dried out.  I fell asleep that night.

The next morning:

I woke up the next day for school.  I immediately looked for my phone and took a picture of myself. One of my eyes looked lazy but I was happy to be alive. I immediately got up and got dressed for school. I felt good. I told my mom I loved her and went to the bus. 

Thought the day of school thoughts kept re o occurring about the night before. It was all weird to me. I felt kind of dazed but I just figured it was because of my experience the night before. I talked to my friend’s about and they laughed. U realized life was not meant to be taking for granted and I wanted to live each day like my last. I texted my sister about how crazy the night was and how I’m never smoking again in my life.


Everything changed again around 5 o’clock while
Eating dessert with my brother and sister. I felt that same anxiety and panic as the night I smoked weed.  I started to freak out, but I tried my best not to show it. I looked over to my sister and she looked extremely disturbed. She had a shocked face and looked at me and said are you ok in a really concerned voice. I said yes. 

It’s hard to write my life out from now to six years ago, but I went through a lot of panic attacks, anxiety, and regret everyday. I spent all my free time researching the way I feel.  My life since this day has felt like a dream. This doesn’t feel like reality. I’m writing this now because I feel it getting worse. I just hit the six year mark and April-May is the time I think about it. I’ve completely changed from that. I have never told my parents, and sometimes I wonder if they notice. They know I don’t smoke weed but they think that’s because I’m a “good kid”. I believe I have depersonalization and derealization. I pray it goes away sometime soon. This has caused me to look back at all my childhood memories and pray to get those times back. My personality I feel like has changed. Maybe it’s not all the bad experience I had,  more of just growing up and puberty and all that but I don’t know. 

Due to this experience here are a list of things I struggle with.
-self diagnosed depersonalization and derealization (my symptoms are 100% accurate)
- Anxiety, and not depression I don’t think but a lot more sadness. Dwelling on the past.
-I’ve never drank alcohol because of this. I have smoked weed again after this and had a good time (still had anxiety, only took one hit) but it hasn’t fixed anything. I will not be smoking again. 
-I’m afraid to feel anything other than sober. If I feel slightly different , like a head rush or something I go into full blown panic mode. 
-social anxiety. I think because months after the experience I spent a lot of time to myself and kind of forgot how socialize.


***WHAT SHOULD I DO**** 

I’ve kinda lost hope. I think this is it. I’m gonna be like the for life. I want to go to therapy and I want medication to fix this but will it even work? I’m afraid to take a sip of alcohol how am I gonna swallow a pill that could possibly make me feel different. I’m so lost. What do you think? Go to a therapist? Try and get medication?

I was doing good with it for so long but as we go more into more traumatic memories I feel myself unravelling again. I have great friends and a great boyfriend, an understanding boss, and all the external factors are as good as they could be, but now that I'm facing certain things and feeling the horrible things I have been hiding from I am struggling to keep on keeping on. I am not at a point where I'll pack it all in - which is what I was so close to before starting on the meds and the therapy - but it's getting harder and harder to keep up appearances and tbh I'm getting closer and closer again to the place I was in before where ending it all just seemed like the only way.

depression,"Hey guys, I’ve recently come out of a long depressive episode that began in October of last year. I was in a partial hospitalization program in January (apathetic and suicidal), and I really wasn’t doing ok. Come end of March though for reasons still unknown, I started to gradually come out it. I’ve really enjoyed these last 6 weeks. I’m such a different person when I’m not depressed. I’m also sure that the reduced pressure to constantly be working and producing etc. from the lockdown has been beneficial to my mental health, of course. At least, the times line up well. 

I think last year I was in a normal/happy/enjoying life mood for only a total of 3 months last year.... which is bleak, but look over the last decade, it’s been progressively &amp; incrementally better every year. Even now though I feel so much better, I am visited by the sad reality that I could slip right back into an indefinite depressive episode... It could just be around the corner and all my enjoyment of life I’m currently feeling will end.

depression,"I’ve been struggling with depression and suicide these past 2 years. I’ve been losing sleep, gaining weight, suffering from mental breakdowns, and have no self worth of any kind. Every single day I suffer from suicidal thoughts,  irrational guilt, mood swings, anxiety, low self esteem. It has gotten so bad that I literally picture myself being tormented and beaten by my friends and loved ones every single night. Some days I even ask myself “why am I still alive?” “How does someone like me even function?”. These questions plague my mind to no end. And every time I try and tell people about it I get extremely self conscious and more often than not I mentally beat myself up in doing so. My depression has also caused me to lose long lasting relationships with women. and they ended up cutting ties with me as a result. I can’t live like this anymore. I need to realize that not everyone can always be there for me and I have to face my problems alone. Just because I suffer from depression and guilt doesn’t mean that people should be my friend out of obligation and pity. I’m a fucking retard for believing that I’m so “important” to everyone’s when in reality I’m easily forgettable. I’m nothing more than a sorry excuse for a clown.

depression,"I have struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Middle school, as I’m sure it is with a lot of people, was really hard. Band class was always my favorite just because music has always been that outlet for me. When I was in eighth grade one of the band directors moved to a different school and we got a new top director. My initial interaction with her wasn’t good because we got into an argument over me losing my locker combo. From that day she would tell people I “hated” her and laugh about it. When I never even said anything remotely close to that. Fast forward towards a few months and my English class was having a project on “mental developments” (learning disabilities, disorders, that stuff), so I chose depression just because it’s so well known and i needed an excuse to know more I guess. I checked out a book from the school library called “Coping with suicide”, because I wanted to have a slide on that. I was reading it it the band room after school one day and that new director tells I was only reading that for attention. I’m not sure how the conversation started but that stuck with me. I tried telling her it’s for a project and she just kept insisting no one would “be carrying it around for everyone to see if they didn’t want attention”. One thing led to another and she was joking about if I cut myself. She told me, “just remember, never across the street always down the stream to get the job done”. Both the teachers laughed at it. I broke down because I didn’t understand. Maybe deep down I wanted someone to ask if I was ok but she talked about it as if I was a joke and she thought I was annoying. I went home for the next couple days and would hurt myself.

After that incident I emailed the band director I was close to and told him everything about how she made me feel and why I thought her comments were bad. I had talked about my mental health casually with him before and was one of the few adults I trusted. He told me that the adult thing to do was understand she’s new and that it could cause turbulence because I’m not used to her, and that no one would fire her just because I decided I have a problem with her. Even when I didn’t ask that. He told her about my email and  I think that’s what led to the last of my middle school interactions with her that I remember.

I can’t remember the exact time of the year it started happening but band people would walk up to me and randomly ask, “are you sad?”. It made me uncomfortable considering none of those kids had talked to me before. Then finally one boy came up to me and asked, “yo are you going to kill yourself”. I said no and got defensive. He said that the new band director had told her band that, and that everyone should go tell me not to or ask about it (paraphrasing).  I was embarrassed and again felt like my feelings were invalidated because every kid that was sent by her would ask jokingly. After that I was told by my mom’s coworker to never talk to her or even look at her again, so I didn’t. I kept that through high school. Even when she would walk up to me at competitions and say things like, “aww you still hate me huh” or tell the parents helping us , “oh all the kids are great, but this one can hold a grudge”. 

I haven’t forgiven her and I never will. I am now an adult that can’t look at a loose razor without hearing what she said to me in my head; I don’t feel my feelings are valid because to her I’m an attention seeker. The part that bothers me most is that from my knowledge nothing even close to that happened to any other kids. In fact, most every kid who ever had her loved her. So it makes me think if she had a point. I don’t know if I deserved that or not. I was the problem. I still think about telling her this but I can’t get the courage, and probably never will.



TL;DR: Had a teacher in 8th grade that would call me an attention seeker and make fun of the idea of me cutting myself, then told her class to ask if I was going to kill myself the next time they saw me. A lot of what she said stuck with me and has reinforced a lot of my destructive behaviors.

He's been pissed with all this covid stuff and been really touchy about things. Asked me to do something a week ago that I just forgot about I guess, my bad.

depression,"I posted this on the mental health sub but it was buried. So I'll try here. 

I'm diagnosed with depression, butI'm mostly functional enough to maintain a job and relationships. My relationships with friends and family are going better, especially with friends. I'm more emotionally open than ever before and I've been seeing a therapist for 5 months who's helped me spot my negative patterns and issues that fuel my depression. So my everyday functionality is getting better, even it fluctuates. 

But there's one thing that therapy is not helping with, and that's my general feelings towards life and existence. I feel like I can rationalanize a ""meaning of life"" in the sense that I think we make our meaning by doing what makes us happy. But I don't feel that, I feel an emptiness and hopelessness towards my future and existence. It's a void that feels unfillable, there's nothing I can imagine that would make me feel comfortable with living which in turn makes me sad and dreary all the time. 

Its like I'm looking for some ultimate goal that will fulfill me and make me happy but there is nothing. I used to imagine that making music could fulfill that, but I don't feel that way anymore. I still want and like to do it, but the hopeless void makes any goal I can imagine achieving pointless. Why have a grander goal when it won't fill the void? And I truly believe it won't fill the void. I have a job, I own an apartment, I have great friends but nothing does it. I can be happier because of these things, the void is always there. There's nothing that will my life feel worth living. Sounds silly but that's how it feels. 

Having kids is the most ""natural"" goal a human could have, at least the one that makes most sense evolutionarily, but I'm beginning to believe it's wrong for someone to have the power to decide for someone else to exist. I have a sex drive, but I don't want children at the moment and my thoughts around the subject make me think I won't want kids in the future. I can imagine having a kid would awaken some sense of purpose in me but I would feel its wrong to have a kid just to give myself meaning. Seems insane to me.

So I feel like an outsider to the world. I don't understand how the average person is content with living. I feel existential dread literally all the time. I relate to very few people in my everyday life, just my friends. The difference between them and me is that they can be comfortable with leading a normal life while pondering the same things I do. I'm affected by it every day. I feel disconnected from the world. I'm weirded out by the fact that every person I interact with doesn't know why they exist and most of them manage to act ""normal"" in despite or that. I find it bizarre that it's expected of me to care about everyday things when I literally don't what I am on an existential level. Our world crazy and I just can't be comfortable with existing. These thoughts are intrusive and it's just a part of who I am.

depression,"I've spoken about him before and my concern that he was just a pothead and didn't want to work. Turns out he was experimenting with lots of other stuff, which led to a few panic attacks. His mother took him to the ER and they did a psych eval and he agreed to be admitted to a drug/alcohol place for a few days.

He was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Clinical Depression, which is also what I have) but with Psychosis. Fantastic. His mother met with the counselor and my son, then he came over later that day to tell me about it. I'm not happy with the drug choices, but he says he feels better and wants to live better. 

He was supposed to call two different counselors this week to set up appointments, but he didn't. Also was recommended he go to NarcAnon, but he didn't. He talks a big game and doesn't follow through on a lot of situations.

I'm planning a trip to buy a sailboat that would entail bringing it back to our home over a two week period. He and I are very capable and he's excited about the trip. However, last night he stayed out all night and got a room with a girl. He said he drank a little, I'm guessing smoked some pot, too.

He's staying with his mother, btw.

I get the idea that someone with his diagnosis needs to stay away from alcohol and drugs altogether. I'm thinking I want to meet with him and his counselor to get some answers and determine if I want him to go on this trip with me. His mother just stopped paying child support. He lost his phone, but she paid to get a new one (it's on my account). I wish I hadn't done that because I think he needs to get away from communicating with some of his friends. He's still on my health insurance.

depression,"Hello everyone! I hope you do great, I know you don't but at least it helps me thinking that there are some people that have a good time. Ok so I'm writing this and it's 8:27 AM and I haven't slept in the WHOLE night since 12 PM that I went to bed. Well that's not totally true and I will explain you. You see I'm having a hard time sleeping the last... I don't actually remember but I think It happens for more than a year or even more. So I'm going to bed and I just can't sleep 99/100 times. I must wait in the bed for at least 2-3 hours until I can finally rest (lol). And of course every little sound or light can distract me A LOT! Also I can't explain it but I have a felling every some minutes that I want to pee and always going to back and forth to the bathroom and seriously going to sleep is a FUCKING TORTURE to me. Rarely I get sleep normally. Most of the time I'll finally sleep about 2-3 AM and wake up at 9 AM (I'm choosing that so I can have more time for programming) so it's about 6-7 hours of sleep and I'm mostly ok. 

So yesterday (aka 8 and a half hours ago) that rare time happened! I slept so fast that I actually don't even remember how fast it was. BUT! Of course there is a but! So what happened? You see, my young brother (11 years old to 12 in 1 month) also sleeps with me in the same room. So I remember waking up and him also being awake and shaking in his bed like a fucking snake which instantly turns me mad cause like I saying it distracts me A LOT! Now I don't know if I waked up because of him for sure or if it's a coincidence but It also happened some other times that I noticed he was loud. Oh and also he opened a small light we have in the room and I'm normally closing when I'm going to sleep. So yeah FUCK him anyway, he sucks as a brother in general!

The problem: You see... I said that it's VERY HARD for me to sleep. When.... When waking up from sleeping it's 10 times harder to sleep again. When in theory it's not harder cause it doesn't take the same time but normally consider the fact the I'm super relaxed after sleep I should have being able to sleep immediately in 1-2 minutes but normally for me it can take several minutes and in some very rare times even more. For some reasons I wasn't able to sleep again NEVER! Yep you heard right. I don't know exactly what time I woke up but after some time I couldn't sleep again I saw my phone and It was about 2 and something AM so I guess I woke up a little bit before 2 AM. That means that I was in bed for about 6 FUCKING HOURS and I wasn't able to sleep. Well I was in bed and trying to relax and not in my phone so I guess that's better than nothing but still... That was the first time in my life I haven't slept for the whole night.

Don't know what to say and what to do. I fell so angry, sad, weak and fucked up at the same time. I just want stop to exist! Both my body and soul (if soul exist). This is the first time I'm sharing something from my life and HELL it's one of the worse thing that happened to me. Sorry If it was to big and thanks A LOT for anyone that got until here.

I didn’t have any of these urges for quite a few months, and they’ve kind of resurfaced in the past few days  due to stress from school and stress from my relationship. I’m very insecure and anxious about my relationship, fearing that my boyfriend will leave me and that I’m a burden to him. Sometimes he needs time alone (to play video games or to just be without me I think, because he’s often with family or friends, which isn’t bad but I would say that it’s different from ‘time alone’). I rely on my boyfriend a lot for emotional support, especially now because I can’t see my psychologist due to corona virus, and the one had is on leave so I have to start over with a new one. I’ve tried messaging helplines but it doesn’t really help and I get too anxious to call. I think I might be in a controlling relationship, but I will do anything to make it work because I love my boyfriend more than anyone else and he is my world.

depression,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 24 years old law student from Denmark. Been struggling with depression and fatigue for many years. Last year I *""finally""* got diagnosed with ADD, which was kind of a relief, since I had been struggling with my concentration and fatigue during my long days of studying. Before I started on the ADD medication I had (and still am) been taking Sertraline 150 mg for depression and anxiety.

I was prescribed **Ritalin Extended Release**. I started on a low dosage and finished at 54 mg. Ritalin made me really tired – after 3 hours of ingestion I was ready to take a nap even though I had a good 8 – 9 hours on the pillow.

Last week my psych prescribed me **Vyvanse** (30 mg). Two days ago, the dosage was upped to 50 mg. I take it when I wake up. Generally, Vyvanse feels like a better fit for me.

**Current pros and cons of Vyvanse:**

**Pros:**

\- Subtle affect

\- No anxiety

\- Improved confidence

\- Improved mood

\- Concentration greatly improved *(I have to be aware of myself – it’s a lot easier for me to fall into the YouTube trap when on Vyvanse)*

**Cons:**

\- About 6 – 8 hours after ingestion

1. Tension around my temples and around my neck (this one is not pleasant – I have a feeling that I must squeeze my eyes before I’m able to study – Aspirin doesn’t help)
2. Gets really tired
3. Concentration greatly reduced – more than before taking the medication

\- No appetite (I do eat healthily and make sure to get some good meals and drink plenty of water during the day)

I would very much appreciate your experience with Vyvanse!

i returned home and i waited for my dad. the clock hit 6 and he wasn’t there, then 30 minutes went by. he called my mom, not me (probably forgot my phone number). my mom called me into the room and said my dad was on the phone. i picked up the phone and i couldn’t hear anything he said because his phone is literally broken and he won’t fix it because he just doesn’t give a shit. so i just hung up and was completely unable to celebrate the day. all i felt was betrayal. his excuse to my mom was that he couldn’t get someone to cover his store, but it’s HIS STORE. his own private business, which he closes whenever he doesn’t feel like working all the time.

these are some shit times man. i just wanted him to be proud of me honestly at the end of the day.

I am lucky that I travel internationally relatively frequently for work. The fact that there is no travel has made me way less motivated, because I did all the boring bureaucratic work for the opportunity to travel 3-4 times a year. Without that I look forward to work less and the monotonous work seems a lot less interesting. They are talking at work about a lot less trips in the future as they “discovered” a lot more things can be done remotely, so even when travel is allowed again there might not be any or nearly as many trips.

I also try to plan personal trips as often as I can, and these are trips that get me through the tough days. I need things to look forward to otherwise I don’t really know what the point is.

Until last summer I could not even understand why someone wanted to cause themselves pain or commit suicide. At that time I started having doubts about my gender identity, I started hating my body and wanting to cut myself. 

Then school started again: my grades slowly started to drop and I also had several crises and panic attacks, mainly because of my father's expectations. My girlfriend and I had a long-distance relationship, but nevertheless she helped me as much as she could. She always accepted me, without ever complaining about my sudden disappearances that could last even days. 

Before I knew it I had started to cut myself and turn everyone but her away. I kept telling my best friends that I was fine, that I was just a little stressed about studying. Towards December I finally accepted to be transgender, but I felt more and more discomfort towards my body. I only came out with my older sister, my best friends and my girlfriend and they accepted me. 

By now I had closed any kind of dialogue with my parents, they only asked me about the school and complained about my grades. They told me to try harder and that it was only my fault because I didn't care about school. 

Every day was a nightmare: in the morning I only got up because I didn't want to stay at home, I went to school an hour early just to be able to stay in the empty classroom imagining that I was the only person in the world. I never really bonded with my classmates and just talked to the partner next to me. Every day was suffocating and my only hope was that they would call me by surname or simply go unnoticed, I thought I wanted to become more and more invisible. 

My two best friends ended their relationships and I started to keep in touch less and less with the one I thought I was closest to. I had to stop the other from committing suicide because of what had happened. I felt helpless and could not find the right words to console him. 

I left my girlfriend because I couldn't give her enough attention, but I only made her suffer terribly. It was excruciating, I felt empty for days. It often happened to me that nobody sent me messages. I never cried for her, I can't, and anyway I don't think I have the right. 

In April I attempted suicide. I wanted to jump out of my bedroom window. I only said that to my best friend, but he called my parents before I could do it. That day I cried more than in my entire existence. For days I have not been able to understand that I am still alive. My father asked me for explanations for what happened, but I never answered him.

but I feel like I just have to get this out. 

I’m currently a soon-to-be college junior and I’ve been suffering from depression for a while but within the past two years, it’s literally gotten so bad. My family doesn’t know because they don’t really believe in mental health. I’ve made comments in the past but all they said was they were going to put me in a “crazy hospital” and they never really showed that they were willing to help and support me. I’ve been seeking treatment by myself not only for my depression, but Binge Eating Disorder as well. 

I feel so alone in this process, even though I have friends who support me. My therapist and my friends tell me that I’m improving, but I seriously don’t believe them. I feel like I don’t deserve the people in my life, too. My best friend doesn’t really understand what I’m going through, but he tries to give me suggestions and support. I try to suggestions, but I feel like they never work and I become frustrated and give up on them. Lately I feel like he’s giving up on me. Today I was asking for some things I could do during the day because I’ve become bored of the usual things I do. He told me that he doesn’t know what to say to me because any suggestion he gives I push away and just his tone sounded like he gave up on me. I feel like I constantly depend on people to help me and I know I’m the most selfish, awful person ever because I feel like I drag them into my shit. 

I know everyone is giving up on me. I’m losing friendships because I’m a selfish, depressed shit. I honestly don’t even have many friends at college. I just transferred this year to a new school and I feel like I barely made friends. I know eventually everyone will leave me, so I just want to give up. I don’t want to try anymore and I just feel like the best option is to die. My best friend told me that’s selfish, and you know what? Maybe it is. Maybe I am selfish.

depression,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I want as many people as I can to see this...
I think a best friend of mine has been going trough a lot lately, not sure if she’s depressed but she definitely needs some kind of help which I tried to provide but failed... Lately she is talking about how much she is sick of everything and how she’s done and wants to die (because if you’re dead you cant feel anything at all - her words) she said she doesn’t enjoy life anymore either and it keeps reoccurring more and more often. Last 3 days she refused to speak normally with me (there were some minor complications with what I said but it wasn’t as bad that it would cause such responses), always answering with okay, nevermind, nothing or idk. 20 minutes ago she finally said something else which was “im sick of being here” sentences again. I’m really worried about her actually being able to do it... the worst part is it’s an online friendship and all I could think of so far was contacting a friend she has from real life to try and prevent it, but he isn’t the most reliable person and I’m scared if anyone knows about her true feelings.. she will get mentally worse even more (im the only one she has opened to so far) The causes of this sadness is pressure from really bad parents, overall disappointment of self, with loneliness (wanting to be shown affection). I do care about her and love her but I really suck at showing such emotions... maybe she has doubts about me actually caring idk. But that doesn’t matter here. What matters is finding a solution to help her, she said she doesnt want help from others (therapists,school psychologist... probably because she doesnt want other to know). But I can’t be there for her irl nor can I comfort her online. If her parents know about it, it can turn really really bad or if they still have a bit of understanding and love inside of them (which i believe they do) they’ll seek help for her. But I’m too scared to take that risk but I don’t want to just stand here watching her go away. That’s why I’m here to see any other possible solutions before doing this rash one...

depression,"My mental health for this semester has been a mess. I’ve been crying at least a couple of times everyday, thought about dropping out—without going into details, it’s got a lot worse than that. The only thing that’s kept me going is because I have a workplace that I genuinely love starting in August. Still, the amount of emotional pain that I’ve went through particularly in the last couple of months is probably the worst it’s ever been. 

This particular assignment has been the worst. The lecturer hates me for some reason, and is rude to me almost every time I ask for help. As someone who has numerous learning difficulties, I’ve had to ask for help a fair amount. I didn’t fully understand it or the content, and I couldn’t even test it (it was basically to make a robot move around a wall) because I couldn’t get the software to work on my computing. I’ve been a very high achieving student and I knew (and still know) that there’s a real possibility that I’ve done badly on this assignment for reasons mostly outside of my control. 

I’ve basically hated every moment of this semester, and somehow I continued to persevere through it. Within seconds of clicking the submit button, I broke down. So much stress was wrapped up in that project, and even if I wanted to change what I did, I can’t. It’s gone. I never have to look at it again. It doesn’t even feel like an achievement. Just a release of so much bottled up energy is now being able to be let out.

depression,"I'm reaching out as I am in over my head with life currently, and have been for some time. I have had long term issues with depression, addiction, and changes of medication to help my depression and panic attacks. 

I was struggling at my job prior to the COVID crisis and was trying to interview for new roles when I essentially lost it, The day of my first interview I began to have loss of control with speech and eye movements, and it progressively became worse with dizziness and lack of balance. I resigned my current role a few days after as I was in a very bad state. I was under pressure at my last  job and I was already on medical leave when I resigned. I resigned prior to the crisis formally starting which puts me into an even worse position.

My confusion cost me the ability to care for myself, I have been unable to drive since and I have had to lose my health insurance, my relationship, and now I face moving in with family in roughly a week's time as my partner cannot support me in my condition. I have become a burden on my partner (soon to be ex) and I have no income or health insurance for the near future. I will become a burden on my family when I move.

I have no health insurance, when I tried to apply during the start of the crisis I was so confused and dizzy I made a mistake in what I signed up for, and was unable to find providers to help me with this insurance where I live. As a result I had to see a Dr. who did a house call who provided me with temporary meds, the SSRI I have been taking only has a few days left, and I don't know how to manage due to all of my recent med changes, I no longer take heart burn meds, I've been trying to taper off everything I used to take essentially.

I have recovered some of my speech and balance, but I have lost everything during this time. I accept full blame for my actions getting me to this point, I am lucky I am still able to write and communicate somewhat, but I am at a loss as to what to do next. I do not qualify for disability or for family programs as I am single and soon to be moving, I do not have health care, I have no job and I am struggling to find a new one in this crisis and due to my own bad path of decisions, I do not feel well enough to get another job if I could actually find one, and I find myself having constant panic attacks and have suffered for weeks.

There is more but this is it in a nutshell. I do not know how to get help, I reached out to a crisis line yesterday and went in circles due to my inability to be able to pay to be seen by a doctor. I am panicked enough to call a help line, but I am not able to get help from it apparently. I am going in circles with stress each day, trying to pack what I can of my belongings, trying to taper medication that does not seem to be helping anyways, and unable to stop the panic attacks and care for myself.

depression,"You ever noticed how you cant make anything go away? You have to accept and move on. Forgive, but there is no forgetting. 

My depression comes from various sources. Awfully abusive and neglectful childhood, teenage drug use, being exposed to violence, molestation, hating my body, and then worst of all being raised religious and coming to the realization that there is no god and having to face nihilism. 

I have to come up with solutions to deal with all of these different shitty things that haunt me and make me feel worthless, weak, and remove my motivation to live. 

Sometimes a long rigorous walk/jog will take my mind off my insecurities. Sometimes hanging out with friends gets my mind off the absence of love that I always felt as a kid. Planning, keeping a routine and forcing myself to do work keeps me from feeling like I need all the drugs I used to take. 

But I can't find any comfort in facing the abyss of meaninglessness that existential depression brings. I try to not let my mind wander but I'm not well mentally, and that makes it hard to be succesful. Every now and then I'll be having a great conversation either with someone who is a close friend or a new potential friend, and then the conversation will get deep and I'll remember the fact that none of this matters and I panic. I get anxiety that sometimes turns to panic, and worse I get and empty feeling that washes all happiness away from me. My fear of fading away is so great that it causes a ptsd like response and I can sometimes go into full blown hallucinations if I'm already under a lot of stress. It only takes this to bring me back to square one, and I'm lucky if I dont find some unhealthy way to cope like binge eating or smoking cigarettes for a few days or just watching youtube when I should be doing something productive. 

When I tried meditation it infuriated me. It only felt like a waste of the precious time I have on this planet and it caused me to have quite a few panic attacks. I remember breaking 4 or 5 expensive items in my room because I wanted to trigger a chain reaction. I figured if I did enough things to make myself angry, I would then hurt myself, and if I hurt myself bad enough, then maybe I could work up the nerve kill myself. This was a couple years ago, when I was actually less depressed than I am now. It's so paradoxical, I fear death most of all, but the pain of life is so great that death seems like the best option sometimes. 

I just want to forget that there is no god. I want to go back to the ignorance, the self-reassuring ignorance that envelops you in warmth almost as soon as you're faced with pain, that belief in an all-powerful entity is just as good as there actually being one. But like I said, you can't go back, you can't unlearn or forget what you have experienced. 

Many people lose their religion and end up OK. They have strong minds, and don't struggle with much or any mental illness. But having multiple mental problems and so many contributing factors, and then losing the one thing you were centered on... I don't know how to ever feel good again. I ended up losing the two closest people in my life recently too, they would have been my center after losing religion, and now I feel like I'm searching for identity but disappointed at everything I try. My surviving family just wants me to hold down a job, finish school, get a relationship. 

I have a job and I'm taking classes, but I have no passion for the profession I'm studying for. That's not entirely true, because I did lay every option out on the table and picked the one I hated the least and that played to my strengths, but I still dread the visions of my future when I think about it. 

I've never had a semblance of a relationship before, everyone thinks I'm either gay or just really secretive. I'm not ugly, a little out of shape but overall -&gt; tall, strong, with an attractive face, good hygiene, so people find it hard to believe I've never even kissed a girl let alone actually dated or been sexually involved with one. I'm worried about being alone forever because I have so many sexual issues from being molested, being exposed to hardcore pornography from 5 on, questioning my sexuality, and just feeling a general disgust towards sexual acts that mixes with arousal and scares the shit out of me. Not to mention I have a small penis... 

The outline for a healthy member of society just repels me. I dont want to to follow either side of the political spectrum, I want people to gain some fucking self awareness and stop being so evil, that's about it. From there we can figure it out. It's so hard to connect with people who arent also in really fucked up places in life. It's like the only happiness I feel is when I'm sharing my struggles and hearing out the struggles of others, because I feel less alone and it gives me a bit of burning hatred towards the indifference society holds about mental health.

I have ADHD, PTSD, lots of anxiety disorders and a depressive disorder. Lately I have noticed that I have started to become more depressed again, and its hard to know how to get out of it.

My life have been challenging as long as I know - I got sexually abused as a child, I got abused by my mother and her boyfriends, I got raped and abused by my ex boyfriends. Last year, I found out I had ADHD and already got the diagnosis when I was 5 years old. No one ever told me, I randomly found out when I was starting EMDR therapy for my PTSD, and my therapist read through my whole damn journal. It explained a lot about myself, and it felt good to know that I had an disorder, not a fucked up lazy person who didnt care about anything.

However, the last 5 years, I have struggled with pain in my back and knee. I talked with a lot of doctors. They told me I was a lazy teenager, I was a young girl and I just needed to excersise. I got pissed off because I knew something was wrong. I had a fulltime part job, I walked every day in the nature, I used to have a horse I took care of and rode. I tried the last time to seek help last summer, and got told to just do some excersise and it would get better. I gave up and lied to the doctor and said it worked for me. I knew no one cared or listened to me, so it didnt matter anymore.

Suddenly, at the end of february/start of march, I start to walk weird. My left foot turned sideways, I couldnt walk normally. My pain in the knee got worse, my backpain got worse, my left hand got painfull and I couldnt use it. I stopped showing up for work becauss I couldnt do anything. I went from being full functioning to suddenly depend on my boyfriend to get help to get up from bed and get dressed. I was so angry and pissed off because I have never wanted to be dependent on anyone, but here I was, I couldnt do anything alone anymore. I went to my doctor, she is a new doctor I changed to recently. She saw me in pain and in how bad shape I was in. She took all those tests on me, and told me I had to do a MR scan of my head and back. She told me I couldnt work or do anything at all. I just had to be home and rest. 

I will admit, the first weeks of being gone from work felt like a vacation. Afterwards I felt lonley, and frustrated. Doctors gave me opiates for my pain. I took a lot of them at one point because it was a living nightmare. I slept most of the days away, I felt drugged a lot and didnt have energy to do anything. At some point I got scared of my opiate usage, and stopped taking it. All the pain came back, I struggled a lot to stay away from them. Now Im doing fine, I dont use it at all. I have another type of medication thats not addictive and helps me longterm.

All the medications I use daily makes me feel ill. I struggle to eat because I get nauseous every time, and I notice Im losing weight. I dont have a scale in the house due to me having anorexia in 2013/2014 and a scale could trigger me back to it. 

My doctor called the hospital and saw my condition got worse. Normally I would have had to wait many months, but suddenly got a appointment to do a MR scan in april. The scan showed me that I have developed scoliosis. All those years of pain was because I was developing scoliosis. I have scoliosis in my neck and in my back, and its only getting worse. It makes me so angry that I tried to seek help for 5 years and no one took me seriously. Its good to know that I know my body to well when something isnt right - but if one of the doctors took me seriously during the last 5 years, I wouldnt have gotten scoliosis. It saddens me that no one believed me - I had to be really bad before I got help. 

Im glad I know whats wrong with me, but now I have to wait a year to get special shoes I can use so my scoliosis doesnt worsen. I have to do a lot of testing, and I cant still do anything. I feel helpless, Im dependent to get help to normal stuff. I havent been at work since the end of february, and I notice I have lost a lot of my friends. At some point when you get sick over a longer time, people stop including you in things, stops checking up on you. I try to talk to people about normal things, but its like they dont know how to talk to me anymore. I feel locked up in my own house, my own body doesnt work and I feel limited to do anything. I cant even do normal chores without crying because of the pain. I get more exhausted and sleep a lot more, I dont feel I have anything to get up to. In addition, my mental health suffers more. I get more anxious, my PTSD gives me more nightmares and trouble sleeping at night. I feel the one thing that makes me manage my depression at the moment is my ADHD medication, because it stabilizes my mood and feelings. Without them, I dont think I would have handled it as well as I have done so far. 

I feel close to relapse to selfharm - but I know that I havent done it for almost 7 years now. What a waste it would be if I relapsed and couldnt celebrate 7 years without selfharm.

I contacted my doctor earlier this week, and asked her if she could help me get in contact with a therapist. I later plan to reach out to my therapist who did EMDR with me, because while I did EMDR last time - repressed memories showed up and made me remember the sexual abuse from my childhood. Meanwhile, I struggle a lot with money since I dont work now and the people who are supposed to check up on me and decide if I get disability or not - doesnt do a damn thing to check up on me. They only tell me they want me back to work as fast as possible. They need nurses due to COVID, and Im an educated nurse. My boss always asks me when I get back to work, even when I tell her it can be a long time and not until next year due go long waitinglists in the hospital. It stresses me out. 

I have started a case with the police about the abuse my mom did to me, and my family on my mothers side doesnt want to help me at all. The plan there is to get a restraining order, and I hope the case comes up in court so she could get jailtime. 

Im only 22 year old, yet I feel I have lived a much longer life. I just wanted to rant - I dont have many to talk to and I dont want to feel like Im always complaining to my boyfriend. I want him to be happy and enjoy life. I look forward to when I get the help I need. When I do, Im going on a two weeks vacation to Maldives with my boyfriend.

Firstly I should add I’m going to try and sum some things up 
Welp it feels like so many people die around me and I don’t know how to deal with it Iv had 3 family members 2family friends a girlfriend and one of my best friends die to suicide and 3 family members die of cancer and a lot of it was in the same year I was with my great grandma when she passed she asked where I was even tho I was right beside her and that was the last thing she did my Great grandpa on my dads side died as I was holding his hand and I can still remember the way he lost grip.
I don’t understand why my mom doesn’t like me she never had really my 2 siblings that are hers always came before me and I’m the youngest I should add she would throw me under the bus for them in a heart beat and 1 of them is a crack head and the other ran away like 3 times and was almost arrested for a felony but still she’d do anything for them and nothing for me (I should add my dad is amazing and sticks up for me all the time but he’s pretty much all I got just wanted to add somthing happy)
I feel like I’m never enough for people I’m kinda a loner but I try to keep a couple friends and a girlfriend if I can but most the time they end up leaving me or ghosting me I should say but recently Iv found a few friends that actually like me and Ik won’t leave me 
Iv had a lot of girls cheat on me and Iv found out in various ways my favorite way it is her butt dialing me while having sex with one of my so called bestfriends I feel like at this point it’s my fault that they cheat on me because it happens so much 
Last thing is I think I did somthing stupid I found a girl who loved me unconditionally and I loved her but I was so unhappy in the relationship it was just so repetitive and she just did so many things that made it hard to be with her but I think she’s the only one who will love me that way

depression,"Hey guys. I lost my mom 4 years ago. I was 17 then, mature enough to comprehend what had happened and old enough to have the memories of her death stick with me forever. Her death was sudden and unexpected, so it was really hard to deal with me, it still is. As much as I feel happy for them- I feel lost when I see my friends going out with their mothers or doing conventional “mother-daughter” activities together. It takes a toll on me but I manage to bounce back somehow. 
A lot of times,  when I feel like I’m starting to enjoy or just generally be happy, something inside me reminds me of the visuals from the day of her death - when I saw her, when we took her to the hospital and they declared her dead. I try not to think about it and stay in the moment - but it just doesn’t go away. Any time I feel a slight ounce of happiness, I’m reminded of how I’m motherless and how I shouldn’t be happy. I only assume the worst in every situation. 
In the country and culture where I come from - therapy is a taboo. I was never made to see a therapist because no one thought I ever needed one. I was supposedly very strong emotionally and the question of visiting a therapist never came up. Because of this, I’ve been convincing myself for three years that I indeed am really strong and capable of dealing with this on my own - but the truth is, I’m not. 

What do I do? I could really use some help.

depression,"I've had this demon since as long as I can remember. It's a crippling pain beyond anything physical, it shakes me to my fucking core and no matter how much I try and think of all the people that are worse off than me I just cant seem to fight it anymore I've lost all my fight and guts, I've been picked apart and i just think its time to free myself finally. This isnt a life, this is just an illusion of things getting better letting my guard down and being tore apart again. 

I'm dealing my childhood and teenage trauma that resulted in the fuck up of my only meaningful relationship as a teenager and for the first time in 13 years I allowed someone into my life to take place in my heart. Things were always going to be tricky with it being a long distance thing and knowing i'd realistically not see her for long periods, but everything I did was to better her life and ours together, I paid for everything to give her a life out of poverty and a sex trade. (I'm not the first or last that will fall for thinking you can help someone that probably wont ever want it)

I was cheated on (it took around 5 months) I had to leave her country after travelling 7000 miles just to see her for 2 weeks. For the first time in my life I felt like I was finally doing well and finally fucking happy. I've lost a person that made me wake up every morning after 13 years of being lonely and without anyone it was really nice to wake up to someone that wanted to know how your day was. The smallest things make me happy I love giving to others and never expect anything back.

Even though she done an evil thing I still persisted on helping her and trying my best (the lockdown has me fucked or I'd be there) I just needed her to still be there I couldn't go back to being lonely, and I couldn't face the embarrassment of people knowing and laughing ""told you so"".. ""never trust them"" etc.

I'm now back to the fantasys of wrapping a rope around my neck and releasing this pain as soon as I can. I've lost my job, I'm in my mums box room, I dont feel I can talk to my friends and to be honest the only 2 things that are keeping me alive are trying my best to get strong psychedelic drugs to change my mindset or wait for a substantial loan that's unlikely to come through. My plan is to give it to my Mum who I love dearly all of it  and then I think I can finally do it. I honestly think it will be the biggest relief I've ever had.

I just wanted to be happy just a little bit, no fake smiles or having to pretend to be someone I'm not I've bottled years of pain and torture that I havent even touched on in this for too long. 

Sorry for the mumbled words I just dont want to be a part of this anymore it's not and never has been for me I don't think I'm becoming toxic and weak and trying to slowly kill myself anyway so I'd rather just do a job once.

I’m sure they wanted to live and I would’ve taken their spot. I even caught Corona and wasn’t really affected.

I know I said I have a job that’s better than most and that’s true, I make decent money but it’s still a job at the end of the day.

I’m not even grossly overweight (about 205 lbs) but I am technically obese for my height. My fiancé is also the breadwinner in the relationship so that doesn’t help with self esteem but I don’t take it out on her at all. Just makes me realize how I’m not far in life at all when I’m barely breaking 50k a year and she’s bringing home close to 90k. 

I’m currently in school for creative writing and realistically I don’t know why. I mean I know why, I’m here to finish off my bachelors but whenever my grandmother asks me “what jobs can you get with this?” I want to shoot my self right there and then since she’s the one helping me pay for it. 

I really only stay home and play video games right now because it’s the only thing that takes my mind off of the self pitying but of course I don’t get anything productive done and even if I did put in work applications, I don’t have the skills necessary to get me anything that pays close to what I was making before the virus so my options are pretty much to just stay home and continue taking in the generous unemployment checks and continue to have all of this time to think about how much of a shitty unimportant person I am.

My wild mind never stops. My mind wonders aimlessly looking for words to say. Looking to say the right ones in the right way not to mess up what I have made. My mind is building a house to complete my happiness and love. It’s building, higher and stronger every time I say I love you, and I see the smile I dream about. My mind wonders though and regretting the words I say in the worst way to say it. My mind is empty but full of things, when I heard someone say “I’m thinking of nothing” I see that they have a lot on their mind with no way to explain it. I stand tall in my prison, four walls one ceiling one floor of ideas and thoughts and dreams and passion but no words. I struggle with sleep due to an empty racing mind. I dream of the day that I can have word vomit empty my brain and put the right words in the right way.

Take some time. You’re daft, and wappy.
Get to know the one you chose. 
‘Cause  if its wrong, there’ll be some woes. 

Spend some time, to show you care. 
Spend some hours not in their hair,
Spend  time together and apart.
Don’t reveal quite yet what’s in you’re heart. 

Because, they’re daft, and wappy too
They feel that love”s the right word too,
But over time, the daftness stops
And reality hits, texts, calls, might drop. 

Before you say three little words,
Take times for you, and them for theirs.  
It’s so easy to get a lot caught up,
In times and kisses hugs and stuff. 

But one day soon, they might realise, 
It isn’t love,  just moments in disguise. 
And although you’ve said your three small words
They said it too, but now, it hurts.

They don’t want to be with you anymore, 
They thought they did, but now unsure.
They have to do what right for them, 
Agreed, that’s a thing  we should not condemn. 

It too late now though, you said it back
Three little words you can’t retract,
You meant it then, and mean it now
You’ll have to start again somehow. 

So before you say those little words
Stop, have a think, a massive care. 
A short time later that might change
That’s someone’s life you’ve just enflamed. 

That’s someone who’ll be making plans
How life together would be so grand
That’s someone who’ll give anything
That’s someone feeling the real thing. 

So when it’s new, and when it’s fresh, 
Pause for yourself, just take a breath.
Don’t throw words out without a care, 
They have effect on the other there. 

But If you do, then it’s not for you, 
Then just be honest for they have no clue. 
If you don’t want the road ahead
Be true to you, don’t mess their head.

2020 is a really horrible year for me. Well, it started with the death of my father after a botched heart surgery my relationship with my father was never a normal one he was really abusive and showed no emotions around his kids and I grew up feeling really alone most of the time then he divorced my mom few years ago and he suddenly changed to a better person and we were starting to get some kind of a bond but his health declined rapidly and I had to drop out from university because I can't deal with education during all this 
In March I had to put my dog down because he got cancer and I didn't want him to suffer more. When he died I lost a great friend he was really a great dog
After the loss of my father and my dog I found out that I don't have real friends no one from my so called friends showed up to my father's funeral and no one was there for me. 
In April I decided it's a good thing to ask my friends out because she is literally amazing but she rejected me saying that ""she isn't looking for a relationship right now"" then few weeks after that she started dating someone and this guy is an ass
 I sound bitter and not normal and yeah thats right I'm not okay and I don't know what's exactly wrong with me Is it grief or old wounds opening up or my depression is getting worse

I have never felt that lonely before I feel so betrayed and I feel like everyone is leaving me behind.

depression,"Alright, so this boy took my feelings and basically threw them away like they were nothing. He took me at vulnerable times and made me say things that were inherently not true at all, but I was so stressed and confused I agreed with whatever he said. He completely destroyed my mental state that was already bad, so he just kinda tipped the ice berg. Then he told me to not say anything or act weird, like it wasn't going to affect him whatsoever (which it really didn't seem to because it seemed like he went back to my friends like he hadn't just messed with my feelings). He lowkey pushed me away from my friends by hurting me to not wanting to be around him, and so they'll only here his side of the story and can bend it to be anyway he wants. 

He really just ended really bad after I poured out how I was sorry about bugging him (which I really didn't but him ignoring me like I didn't exist (which he has also done in the past) made me feel like I messed up) It was stuff we could have easily worked through but he said it just wasn't gonna work out. Btw we admitted our feelings after he pressured me into saying something first (which makes me think he needed to make sure I cared before doing anything to push me away but to each his own).

I honestly don't know if he has told anyone, but it really seems like it since on of his close friends that is also one of my friends hardly talks to me anymore and it felt sudden to. Do you think what this guy did was lowkey manipulative and toxic? Or have I just been messed with and depressed for no reason and he's acting as if nothing happened between us at all (it all lasted literally 3 days btw, which messed me up even more cause hes the first guy I've liked since accepting I'm gay and so I feel like I'll just be lonely and unloveable forever 🙃)

I had a girlfriend and for the nearly five months together I was happy because I never had to prove something. However she is going to a different college next fall and she ‘fell out of love’. This broke my heart because I genuinely loved her and enjoyed making her happy and everything. We moved on she unadded me on Snapchat (it’s hard because we were close friends)

I am scared of not finding someone who can accept me for me like she had especially since I feel let down by my friends.

I am 22M and go to a really small college in the middle of nowhere and live in a big city. I am relatively shy and feel uncomfortable in crowds so I struggle to make friends and talk to people online or in general.

Apart from that I am perfectly happy with myself and how I am but when I reach out to my friends I feel like I am judged. I look forward to the future but most of the times I feel like I don’t want to do anything.

depression,"It sucks when your life isn’t worth living. No one can really help you, and doesn’t want to be bothered with a solution more complex than “optimism.” I’m sick of being accused of making a choice to be depressed when most people have reasons to be happy. 

Talking to people was the biggest mistake I’ve made, all they do now is tell me “fake it.” I thought you could help me, it was so hard to admit those things to someone I thought would want to help.  People that give you such worthless advice never really valued you, if they want just want you to go back to pretending.

According to society my only reason to keep living is to prevent others from being sad and guilty. Let’s be honest, they’ll be surprised and then they’ll move on. I think my parents are smart enough to know that theres nothing to cry over.  They’re sick of it. I’ve been going to them for help less and less.  They’ve realized by now that this is the person I’ve grown into. Lastly, I have no friends. 

They want to shame and guilt you into continuing a life that isn’t worth living so they can go back to being happy in theirs. That is more selfish than suicide will ever be. You really expect to believe that people would miss me when they didn’t even really like me?

The reason depression is so painful is because you also know and want for there to be a way out, a way for things to get better, but all you are is a pathetic, pessimist loser who deserves to suffer for being a lazy bum.  

When they refuse to acknowledge the they don’t understand, you’re “invalidating the pain of others.” Why invalidate mine? 

I wish someone could admit there’s no way out. In my experience talking to anyone you trust will just destroy any respect they had for you, and they won’t value you anymore if they ever did. People think they are heroes for sending you to a mental hospital where they never have to see you again. Plus, all my therapists think I’m dumb as shit. 

People are so horrible when you have nothing to offer them.  You could say the same about me for my frustration. But I wouldn’t give up. For so many of my goals I’ve failed over and over and over and over before I could make reasonable progress. Tenacity is such a necessity in life.

I wear a mask that none can see, and yet, no one sees me.

From anguish woven with despair, it hides me well, this mask I wear.

It parades fake smiles in place of pain, and uses laughs to cover tears.

That love and joy and hope and peace, could matter in the end.

depression,"So, I've been declared chronically depressed, and now I am in wait of further treatment, which could easily take 6 months to start. Corona has taken away the last things I somewhat enjoyed doing. I seem to be at non of my friends' priority lists. They never reach out. Hardly see or speak to any of them anymore. The support group my therapist adviced me to join is 'currently not taking new applications' (WTH???). I don't feel loved, and feel that everyone is secretly super tired of my sad moping. Spend most of my days trying to keep myself distracted fron the bad thoughts. Seeing happy couples or hearing my neighbours having gets me so jealous, since all I get is rejection (both romantically, and when trying to meet up with friends). I have serious doubts that I'll ever get better, and I honestly don't know if it's even worth the effort anymore. So life is pretty shit rn.

Since nothing in the years of therapy seemed to work, I decided to start reading again. The new drugs I'm taking supposedly help with motivation, and I guess that's true because I haven't read this much in like forever. I feel that reading from the perspective of other depressive/mentally-ill people made me feel less alone. So, I was hoping any of you might also enjoy reading such books, and we could exchange recommendations and stuff.

So, here's what I've been reading the last 3 weeks or so:

Likes:
- Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky. A modern classic that I feel most people on here will probably know. Follows an awkward boy starting high-school in the early 90's. The movie adaptation has always been close to my heart, so I finally set out and read the book, and I was definitely not disappointed. Being a book, I feel a lot ofnthe ideas and themes are fleshed out a lot better than in the movie. 
- the Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka. This might seem like an odd choice, as it's traditionally interpreted as a commentary on capitalism, it is not hard to insteas interpret it as a man suddenly developing depression overnight. As Kafka suffered from depression himself, it is not unthinkable that he would describe somenof his own experience in this short story, and the way Gregor is treated by his family really struck a chord with me. 

Dislikes:
- Reasons to Stay Alive, by Matt Haig. Non-fiction about the author's experience with depression and general anxiety disorder. I was really interested at first when he described the onset of his condition, but as the book progressed to his healing, I felt it got more and more patronising. 'Accept it when people love you', he says as he described how amazing his girlfriend was to him the entire duration of his illness, or 'travel as much as you can'. Personally, I'm single, don't have anyone to travel with and I'm incredibly frightened of travelling on my own. It really seemed to me like the man was proclaiming he knew it all, whilst simultaneously completely locking me out. Though, he did put me on to the depression interpretation of the Metamorphosis, which is nice.

I still want to read The Bell Jar, by Silvia Plath, but my next book is going to be Kafka on the Shore, by Murakami (though I forgot whether or not I chose that because of themes of mental illness)

I try to tell myself that losing my parents caused this, and I'll snap out of it if I just try to think positively, but I've had these emotions waaay before that. And this will just happen on loop, on and on, and while I try to think that things are better than they were, and this time it will be different, somehow it all just falls apart again for me.

Everyday it's just this overwhelming sense of hopelessness, like no matter what I do, I'll just end up in the exact same spot, no matter what I try or where I try to look for some kind of way out.  


And the worst part is that I feel like I can't tell anybody these things. The last time I tried talking with a friend about these feelings, things got awkward and they wouldn't talk to me for the longest time. 

And those are the friends that I have. Making NEW friends is a whole new challenge. Most of the time when I'm around new people, I'll usually just avoid talking to them because I'll definitely say something stupid or something that will totally fuck it up. It's also the reason I can't hold a real relationship for more than a month, so I've just given up on that.

I've grown distant the hobbies I was passionate about when I was much younger; Music, Film, Writing. Whenever I do any of these things now it just feels empty, and I'm just reminded about how much more these things made me happy back in those days, so I have to stop.

Of course I've had suicidal thoughts, and many times I almost went through with it, but I'm always too scared of doing it to actually do it, so some kind of drive to keep going MUST be there, but whenever I look back, I can never think of what stopped me.

What could have happened? Why was I so much happier and optimistic. when I was young, but suddenly I'm filled with all this anxiety and insecurities that were never there before. Where did these feelings of being a burden and a waste of space come from? 

All I want is to feel excited about life, what it could be, what kind of things I could do, but whenever I look at myself and where things seem to be headed, is that asking for too much?

I left my ex gf who i loved because she always attacked my insecurity and wasn't supportive at all. She has bipolar disorder and i always was supportive for her. It was pretty toxic but i still loved her and i miss her pretty much. My other two gf before cheated on me.
Not a pretty good mix with my codependency. Im always looking to fill my void with other people.

I don't find any positiv in my own life. I hate that i exist. I already hated it when i was 16.

I talk alot about this with my psychiatrist. We are moving forward to try to find myself and accept who i am.
Especially since three weeks, where i made the choice to be myself and not strive for an ideology, religion or other people.
But it is so god damn hard endure this feeling of beeing.
After i moved two weeks ago i started with coke again. I just didn't care and wanted to kill my thoughts and feelings. I also drinked alot.

And yes then there was tuesday.
I just left therapy and got offered some coke. Time goes by and after some lines and beers i was in a good mood and i had the opportunity to take some heroin. I had nothing against it. I never thought i would take heroin in my life. Now i'm here...

I just told it in therapy today... I really try to fight for myself. But i feel miserable. I hate beeing me and yeah... I don't know...

I just needed to get this of my chest with some other people.

Life is shit, the only thing that matters is getting happy, because we are already here. I can't kill myself, but i also hate existence.

depression,"So my problem is that I like to do things and try out something new, when I think about it. But when I have the opportunity to do it, I draw back and tell myself that it's not worth it, I'm not worth it and so on. For example, I would love producing music, but I feel like I have no talent and no clue how to do it at all, that others have years of experience and I have nothing, so why bother, when I have financial and other problems in life.

So in short, my thoughts are the main factor that I retreat from anything new and anything I usually like.

depression,"Hey

Tl;dr at the end.
For the last 2 years my usual daily routine has been to keep myself busy throughout the day, normally with stuff like shows/movies, pc games, music (and also sad music, feel like that should be a separate activity) and I dread going to bed because when go to sleep, all the miserable shit that I've gone through over the years comes up in my mind.
I haven't had a good nights sleep in ages, my family is constantly like ""you should fix your sleeping schedule"", but I just cant bring myself to tell them I am and have been in a bad place for a very long time. Every time someone (mostly family members) asks if im okay, I just want to just cry, but I divert the topic, usually with jokes. 
When interacting with friends and also acquaintances at university, im known as the person who makes great jokes and makes people laugh. It's a coping mechanism for all the other shit. I am very slowly attempting to open up to friends, but since i joke so much, they think its just all silly jokes again.

The reason im having excessive troubles with opening up is that for whatever reason I feel like this (mental issues) is a massive weakness and it would shame me greatly to open up.
The other reason is that my family has been very supportive of me throughout my whole life, 100% more than an average family (based on what ive seen), so i cant bring myself to let them know that im a useless wreck.
Around the time the Joker movie came out last year, i thought that i should seek out help. I even wrote to a mental health-focused clinic here where I live, but they said they were fully booked til next year so i lost motivation again. And now as i started regaining some of it, corona shit happened. Im also graduating university this year, so that has helped me keep focused on that instead of mental issues that much, but its still annoying. 
I dont know what I was hoping to achieve writing this, but ive never opened up like this before to anyone, not even the internet. Maybe any suggestions? Those are always welcome.

depression,"This is a hard topic to talk about because of many peoples presumptions about autism and the stigma associated with it, due to all the people who treat autism and other mental illnesses as a joke *roll eyes*

Despite how some media platforms sugarcoat it, autism is truly a curse and this is coming from someone who has (high functioning) autism. I'm just so exhausted. Literally everything that comes out of my mouth or type is considered socially unacceptable, unintentionally rude, and ""too much information."". It's in mainstream schooling where I painfully learnt that honesty is only a good trait for those people who's thoughts and emotions are relatable and acceptable. For people like me, freedom of speech is forbidden and whenever I talk people are quick to shut me up like I'm a Nazi. I know I am the problem and I am not blaming anybody for it, but i am just so truly exhausted as every attempt to show affection goes down the drain because I'm ""giving too much information"" or ""being creepy"". I really feel like I'm a different species - what I find attractive, like long walls of detailed affectionate text, over-complinenting, sexual humor, weird interests, are the very things literally everyone else says is repulsive. I feel broken and torn apart that literally nothing I do, nothing I say, and nothing I like is acceptable in any way. I just want to love you... crush. But no matter how much I try not to do anything stupid, even limiting all my interaction via texts because I'm socially incapable irl, I still get ghosted and completely treated like a joke. 

 I support LGBT, but I can't help but feel so unbelievably sour seeing all the LGBT groups gathering and staying strong together. Autistic people are generally much rarer, and most of them don't even know they have it or are too fearful to tell anybody else. I literally cannot find anyone remotely similar to me or anyone that is patient enough to accept me and see me as a friend and it is driving me insane.

It is in mainstream schooling where tyranny of the majority can really be seen. The school refuses to tend to my special needs because ""we want to serve the interests of other students and cannot give you special treatment"". In terms of relations with classmates I have no say at all in anything and sometimes I can be dead serious when voicing an opinion and people would think I'm joking and laugh at me - all because I have no friends to back up the things I say. People can come around, whack me on the head and call me a loser and no one would call them out for it - they know my vulnerabilities and they exploit it to the maximum. 

Over the years I have become absolutely hypersensitive to criticism and would cry myself to sleep at any sign of disapproval. Autism + mainstream schooling is absolutely scarring to one's mental health and sometimes I just wish I was never born. There is truly no being of the same species I can identify with, and not a single one that cares whether I die or not.

I am so. So tired of constantly lamenting my past and all the ""socially unacceptable"" things I did. Constantly questioning whether my decisions are what others would consider ""socially acceptable"", constantly feeling like a monkey in a classroom of humans, constantly feeling dirty, unwanted and a genetic disaster that's unfit to live. I just want acceptance, or death. I can't take it anymore.

Freedom of speech is a lie. It only applies to neurotypical people. For people like me, we live under constant oppression and suppression, whether it is directly or indirectly. I am so sick and I want to throw up. I'm so tired of people laughing at me,making fun of me and ostracising me and being unable to do anything about it because of the lack of like-minded people that support me.

depression,"Today I literally tried to go live in the forest. I'm such an idiot. It was super wet out and I couldn't find any dry ground to set up a base. I was there for 2 hours and walked home like a coward. I'm trapped. I tried to die by dropping a bench press bar on my neck earlier but for some reason I lifted it off. There's no way out. I'm stuck alone. I have no friends, everyone finds me repulsive, I am a terrible pet owner and person in general, and from what you can tell from this post I'm self-absorbed as hell.

But I see no point in trying any other way. In this world it quite literally is KILL or BE KILLED. Nobody likes anybody, everyone is trying to outcompete everyone else for a girlfriend, friend or job, and we will slander each other and bring each other down. Why should I be any different? Nobody will ever truly love me that I love back, and nobody will ever even see me as any more than a sad amusement.

For some reason, though, I still persist. I come home because I know my parents will waste gas on the car trying to find me. My lizard won't have anyone to feed him roaches. Everyone around me will either say I was selfish or pretend to have cared. Just like in dear evan hansen, the dead person gets further spat on and the virtue signallers get praise, and I refuse to be a positive experience for anyone since they are the very people that have what I want; people to think stuff of what they say.

I know, this is my fault. If I just tried to lose weight, put myself in social situations, worked harder, there's a CHANCE things could get better. But that's the thing, people are all odds, and are unpredictable for the worse. You could work your way up a corporate chain and guarantee yourself succes in business with work. With attention and care almost any animal can be cared for. If you play minecraft long enough, you'll always be able to find diamonds.

But people aren't like this. If you give off the wrong impression, you can scare someone away for good. And the longer you interact, the greater the chances. So there's no point in trying with people.

I guess I'm just here now for my lizard. When he's passed on, I'm gonna find a way to end this pathetic chain of suffering. I wish there was guarantees, if so maybe life would be worth living.

depression,"I think because the problem is the fact that I have a pretty worthless existence that I won’t be able to leave this depressed state without an unrealistic amount of luck and success. 

Everyone expects me to pretend that I can have value and not be able to make friends.  No one can seem to find a person with friends that doesn’t get their validation from those in their social circle. It seems as though “confidence” in oneself and “loving yourself” is often confused with the notion that, “I can find other people who value me and appreciate my companionship if my current friends decide to leave for whatever reason.”

It’s ridiculous and insulting to tell someone that a “lack of optimism” is the reason for my struggles. I couldn’t make friends when I didn’t hate myself. I’m supposed to be happy because things could be worse. 

The only reason I have to live is to take care of my parents when they get old. All that’s really left to do is finish my degree, and find a job that pays enough. That’s reality.  There’s nothing that I could ever experience that could make life worth living.

I’m can’t lie to myself to increase my “self worth.” I’ve tried it. As if that’s supposed to make me happy. “Just pretend,” I would not be able to survive in this world if I initiated every conversation showing how bad I feel. What’s the point?  No one valued me when I was happy, so what’s the point of pretending?  If I was valuable maybe they wouldn’t be feeding me this bullshit. So I can only assume that it’s because no one wants to be bothered.  While I am NOT suicidal, the only reason anyone ever have as to why it’s wrong is that it will make others guilty. You’re going to hurt your loved ones.  Your friends will miss you. 

The most common piece of advice to those struggling with depression is, “talk to a friend or loved one.” My parents only want me around because I’m their son, so they love me but really don’t “like me.” It’s more likely the memory of me as a baby that they love, and they keep reminding themselves that. Other than that, I have no friends have never been in love.

Everyone seems to think that people who are depressed with no social relationships or any admirable skills are just lazy and just need to get off their ass.

depression,"We weren’t always the closest but whenever we talked we held a conversation pretty long. He seriously was one of the nicest people I knew, I know everyone says that about someone when they die but I genuinely mean that I don’t think I’ll meet anyone as kind as he was.
 
A while after me and him had stopped talking he messaged me “Happy Birthday dude” on my birthday and talked with me for a bit.

depression,"TL;DR: I’m in a pretty bad depressive episode and I want advice on how to create habits that will motivate me to get up and do things that I enjoy and be productive. I need something to help me get out of bed each day. 

I’ve had a major depressive disorder for many  years, but I go in and out of really bad depressive episodes and periods where I’m functioning pretty well. Currently, I feel like I’m in the depths of one and I can’t get out no matter how hard I try. I’m sure school being over and having no set schedule (having trouble finding employment due to covid-19) is contributing a lot to it. I’m bedridden for most of the day and am hardly eating. I can’t find motivation to be productive or to do things I enjoy. My libido is incredibly low and it’s taking a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend (although he’s understanding, I know it upsets him). I’m basically doing nothing but sleeping in until 4pm, scrolling on my phone, and smoking weed, and my weed tolerance is so high at this point that it’s becoming less than enjoyable. I can’t convince myself to do anything else. I want to do yoga and go on runs and paint and write and hike and spend time with my family and I desperately want to have things in place that motivate me to get up and do something and not waste my days away. Normally, I’m okay at self-discipline, but my fatigue as of the late is overpowering. I hate feeling so nihilistic, hopeless, bored, and numb day in and day out. I feel like I haven’t been this bad in years. Does anyone have any advice? How can I keep myself motivated? It feels good when I’m busy and focused on things I’m passionate about. I want to create some sort of rewards system for myself so I can try to set lasting habits, but I don’t even know where to begin. At the beginning of quarantine, I tried to write down everything I did in a day to hold myself accountable, but I kinda gave up on that when my semester ended. If anyone has anything that’s been effective for them, I’d love to hear it. I’m a psychology major but it’s so difficult to take your own advice when you’re in the middle of a nearly debilitating episode. 

NOTE: I already take antidepressants (Effexor) and I have an appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist soon. I’m also in the process of searching for a new therapist, but covid-19 has made the process a bit difficult. I am looking into telehealth options.",Stuck in a depressive episode. Help!!,t3_gotu18,0

depression,"So ill try to keep this as short as possible but i tend to ramble lol. Anyways, i got out of a toxic one year relationship in december, and this girl i was acquaintances/ somewhat friends with admitted she had feelings for me. She has to be one of the most beautiful girls i have ever seen. She had just gotten out of her relationship of three years (officially) in february. We started as friends with benefits but we both quickly caught feelings. I fell hard and from what she told me she did too. She makes me really happy, but ofc everything isnt as good as it seems. In my past relationship my ex would always stalk or talk to her ex’s and lie to me about it, so i never felt like enough for her. Well fast forward to now, i asked this girl and she said she wasnt over her ex and still had some feelings for him, told me that she would always care for him, and be his friend (reasonable) but hearing the way she talked about him made me feel like id never mean as much to her as he did even tho she tells me im better.

depression,"I hate my depression, I hate how useless and angry it makes me. I hate that it makes me fearful and numb, like I’m living on autopilot throughout most of the day. It’s to a point where I need to pretend to be someone else in order to try and gain some happiness. I like someone and it took me so much to get to this point because disaster happened the last time I liked someone. But I’ve only ever pretended to be someone I’m not. Someone who isn’t depressed but is clever and pretty confident. But now I’m getting too deep into it and everyday I’m scared he’ll be disillusioned by me to where he doesn’t talk to me anymore, like most everyone else does. Because I hate the real me. “Oh but if you just be yourself, you’ll attract true friends” but I don’t like myself, the person who doesn’t take risks and does the same things over and over and focuses on simple work, I never liked that for myself. I want to be one of those interesting people but I’m not and being depressed just makes me tired and fogs up my head. 

I feel I won’t have good things to look forward to if I act as myself. I don’t want to be called boring and forgettable again and part of me wants to keep this new guy in my life but I keep him a couple arms lengths away so he doesn’t know more about me and that also creates something superficial.

depression,"I learned two great lessons from this article that I believe can help the people in this community.

Original source: [https://www.vogue.com/article/coping-with-loneliness-in-self-isolation](https://www.vogue.com/article/coping-with-loneliness-in-self-isolation)

In short:

1. Make a damn schedule, Jordan Peterson already said it. But somehow reading it from other source made me value it more.
2. Initiate social interactions where you can reveal yourself to others. When we're lonely, we tend to withdraw from others in our skepticism. We tend to distrust others and harbor the notion that everyone means bad. Rise above this skepticism.

**Parts of the article worth a mention:**

Like hunger or thirst, if loneliness is left unresolved, it can have serious consequences—and the fix is far from straightforward. Just being with other people, she says, will not necessarily make you feel less alone. “If you put lonely people together, they’re going to hate each other after a few minutes,” she said.

According to Cacioppo, sustained loneliness activates an avoidance mechanism in the brain, meaning that you are more likely to be skeptical and distrustful of others, which makes you withdraw even further.

**But how can one possibly ward off loneliness—and all its grave side effects—while in self-isolation?** The key, according to Cacioppo, is to find new ways to regain control. 

*My comment: This is a huge realization for those who often feel lonely. Gain control of your lives. Set some goals. Work toward them every day. The positive daily feedback will improve your mental health.*

“What we’ve found in research is that a sense of control is essential for one’s sanity,” she said. “But things with COVID-19 evolve so quickly; the guidelines we have today might not work next week…. So we are really in a scary situation for our mind.”

The need for order is also mentioned in the popular book Flow:

""The opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy is optimal experience. **When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.** There is no need to worry, no reason to question one’s adequacy. But whenever one does stop to think about oneself, the evidence is encouraging: “You are doing all right.” **The positive feedback strengthens the self**, and more attention is freed to deal with the outer and the inner environment.

depression,"I don't have many friends that can prevent me from doing the stupid self-isolation thing. Kinda a nonsense thing for brains to do, since I kinda feel lonely or whatever, even among other people. And lately I just feel like I'm a burden, and I ought to complain less. People seem to be about as quiet as me sometimes, maybe I've made them uncomfortable, maybe they're just as shy as me. Idk.

I don't need a lot. Just another person to nudge me and be like, ""Yo, still alive?"" That kinda persistence works on me ... I'm kinda directionless and stagnating, and don't really know why I do any of the things I do half of the time. More and more, I feel tired, the kind of tired that no matter how much I sleep, it doesn't go away.

Reaching out sounds great on paper, and sometimes I try... But ultimately, it doesn't really do much. I'm highly considering going back onto Welbutrin, at least so those around me aren't bothered by my stupid sad face. Of course, I know from experience that it won't make the depression go away. It will just lower the volume on everything. Maybe give me a chance to recover a little and see things from another perspective.

But until I can do that, here I am, contemplating my life, my choices, and if the people in my life really need to be dealing with my shit.","I just need a little bit more light, I guess...",t3_got5tu,0

I had an Instagram account back when I was like fucking 14, and they stalked that shit too. It’s so immature. They’re so immature. They know I struggle with mental health &amp; shit, and reddit was my safe space, but finding out today how they’ve tried to find my socials on other accounts has just pushed me over the line. I was feeling depressed this evening, and this just pushed me over the edge. They definitely know about this account by now. 

My friends and I first had a bit of a falling out because I got a boyfriend, so their response was to become quiet and started excluding me cause ‘they were scared of losing me”... so it went downhill from then and we had many big incidents after that (including one which was entirely the fault of myself and one of the other girls - but mostly mine). The past year had just been constant bitching, turning mutual against me, etc. We share quite a few mutual friends, and there is only 1 mutual that I can 100% trust, the others I just confide in and pray they don’t spill. I was constantly stressed. I started having ‘visions’ of hurting myself (vivid daydreams, a few of these scenarios actually came true which is concerning). This was around autumn last year - since then I’ve been having bad dreams about them. My depression peaked, and I began harming for the first time in in years. I went to CBT and did online therapy for months but it was useless.

Since school ended early from lockdown it’s been such a relief that I don’t have to feel like that anymore. Since we’d been friends for so many years (my closest friend for over 7 years) I find it hard to distinguish between whether it’s worth moving on. They were my closest friends. They clearly didn’t want to be friends with me yet I don’t know why they kept leading me on &amp; manipulating me.

I punish myself regularly, yet it’s like it’s never enough.

depression,"How many dollars are we worth to our society ?Hey my name is”help”and this is my story 
I was 18 when I ran away from my family to go and live with my cousin in Colorado 
Honestly because i felt like a burden 
I keep falling into depression and that only brings so much worries to my love one 
I had a mindset of if I was dying somewhere else maybe where no one knows me 
Then my family wouldn’t have to do me a funeral 
They wouldn’t have to spend thousands of dollar just to put me 6ft underground 
When I was in Colorado it was a little better 
But as I get older I found out the depression grew stronger 
It ate me inside out I fell into a black void and that was my comfort place 
I know the people around me said I should get help, go to the ER,talk to a psychiatrist,take some meds.I knew at that time those would help but I didn’t have any Medicaid then nor the money to afford it.But one day it got so hard to the point where I can’t even speak to the people closest to me.So I told my counselor how I was feeling and maybe that was a my own mistake.
She call the police officer and they showed up at my house.They talk to me and made me feel safe so I end up crying and opening up to them.They said the ambulance was coming to get me and they’ll take me to the hospital.I thought I was getting the help I needed so I was happy.But when I found out the cost for the ambulance and the ER I was shocked at how expensive it was so I wanted to get out and deal it in my own way.But they didn’t let me go saying it was legal for them to hold me for 48 hours or how many hours they needed to.They sent me to another clinic that was cheaper but it was still really expensive to me.what could a 18 years old runaway with no job could paid thousands of dollar.In those 3 days that I stay there I put on my best happy face and making them believe I was ready to leave.So they let me leave after the 3 days.A few weeks later I got the bills.$(3,430),($4,000,)($1,800,)($775)(,$80)
They initials charge were may more expensive but they help me cover some 
But there were still thousands left to pay 
Looking at those bills I thought wow that was just how much It cost to get help
This is what it cost to open up in our society 
Maybe this is why many kids are afraid to open up about their depression 
Maybe this was why death was the only way 
I thought If I would have died that day 
And be bury it’ll at least be cheaper 
If i could go back to that moment where I was in that darkness I’d just end it all instead of getting help
But now I’m stuck with these bills just adding another burden on my shoulder 
I HONESTLY BELIVE that many kids out there are in need of help 
If the “help” was cheaper maybe many life would be save 
I hope in the future the world could take into consideration of it

God damnit I'm so sick of that question. Why why why why why I'm tired of explaining myself.

Why do some people do drugs
Why do some people smoke
Why do some people sleep around

Why do some people procrastinate everything 
We all do things that aren't the greatest for us or for others around them. I could ask you WHY to the fucking moon and back yet I'm getting singled out. 
Here's something real simple. I have had multiple traumas in my life which has left me with serval mental disorders. I don't care about anything because nothing matters. I don't eat because I don't care about food. I don't get out of bed because I know there's nothing worth getting up for. Nothing to make me smile. I don't have friends because people are the most selfish things in the world. I don't have a boyfriend because I don't believe in love and it's a waste of time and I'm probably not going to stick around much longer and I wouldn't want to hurt that person. I'm irritable because of how shit the world is and how absolutely pointless everything is. Nobody is unique. Nobody is special. You could be a lawyer, a doctor, an architect, an engineer. But guess what? It doesn't matter. We all bleed we all die. In the end everybody is a fucking loser. You're not important. You'll be forgotten. Some may want that some may not. It's life.

I've had depression for over 10 years now and when it faded it's never really gone. Now it's fully taken over. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to exist. I'm tired of this pain. It hurts too much. 

At work I'm the lowest on the pole but asked to do the work of everyone. When I don't do it or take some me time I get blamed for it. I'm tired of life picking on me. Failed relationships, career, degree, life, family. I'm just tired of being picked on. I don't want life to bully me anymore.

I am a sophmore in high school and I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for so long now. I go to a rather ""elite"" school. At the beginning of 10th grade is when things really went downhill for me. 

I'm Asian American and my parents are very much like those stereotypical Asian American parents who want their children to do the best. A few years ago my mother shared with me that she doesn't care if we aren't top of the class and whatnot.  But I could tell she was only saying that to get me to stop being so depressed all the time. I grew up with a verbally and emotionally abusive father is incredibly strict. Eventually my parents' ideals were just engraved into me. I struggled a lot in my 10th grade physics class. And when I saw that my grades aren't where I'd like them to be I started to become suicidal. Thinking I wasn't good enough to live among other things. 

I was sent to a psychiatric ward for about 10 days before I was sent home. My mother decided that school wasn't worth my life so she decided to send me to cyber school where I continued the rest of my courses. Or should have.

Turns out cyber school was even more of a challenge than my regular brick and mortar school. I struggled to stay on task and couldn't stand looking at the computer the school has given me. I weeks without touching that thing. I couldn't find a reason to get up in the morning and ate little to nothing every day.

I have two therapists. They are both working extremely hard with me. I didn't want any of their efforts to be in vain. So, every time our appointments came around I would always say everything was fine and that I was on top of all my school work. But I'm not. I get extremely nauseous every time I look at that damned computer. I haven't touched it since I took it home. Now I have have a semester's worth of work to do in less than 2 weeks. I can't sleep at night. I get so anxious, but I can't bring myself to complete the work. I'm so scared of everything. I'm scared of my future.

I just want to write something for everyone and get it out of me. I have never thought of myself as unattractive and I had a sexy girlfriend too, but depression doesnt really care who you are. Ever since my breakup ive started to hate myself, i started to compare myself to this girl, ive lost any and all self esteem and confidence, to the point where it feels like i cant even have a proper conversation with anyone. 

I feel lonely as fuck, i have no close friends, i have a great family and am grateful of lifes blessings. However, i just scrolled through instagram and see everyone so happy and seeming so connected with people, it just ate me. I brokedown again on a nice sunny day. 

I fucking hate this world. Why is it that people that are attractive get everything? Why is it that darker skinned people are not admired as much? Why is it that I was chosen by god to have ugly acne oily skin, a body which isnt seen as sexy by the opposite sex, a fucking fat nose, and just fucked up hair? My physical features suck, my personality sucks, people seem to distance themselves from me,  no one remembers me, im a fucking blank. Im just a person living. I have no motivation to achieve my goals. I cant get out of my head. I just cant stop thinking. I wish i could kill myself. I cant post selfies because i look hideous.

I like being anonymous. I like being private. But now its taking a toll. Every one talks about networking and making connections, how do i even start when i cant connect with myself. My brain wants something, my heart wants something, my dick wants something, my eyes want something, im all over the place.

Im thinking about killing myself now. Its getting tiring. Ive cut myself alot and it hurts alot. It brings me back to my senses. But right now i dont care. I want to end it. 

Its too much for me. I cant go outside because everytime i do it gets me depressed seeing people so joyous with smiles on their faces. Ive become so empty. Trying to put on a fake smile and keep everyone happy. No one knows i cry this much, i close the door and drop all my tears and screams into my shirt. Its a fucking beast tugging at my brain.

I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it.

While anyone who is in a big city or mid-middle class and above is either well enough known or has set their roots down. And I empathized with the accused because of my own experience with some accusations at high school my self.

And you know what she said “I’m a woman and I know better.” Saying stuff like “oh he could of just hired a great lawyer and got out of it like all those other rich people.” As if the court didn’t absolve them of their guilt.

I’m just so fucking defeated because I’m like what if that were me? What would you do throw me out and disown me?

depression,"Numb 

I wish I was numb
Unable to feel my heart
Just so I could pretend
That you didn’t tear it apart

I sit here silent
No music or tv
Trying to drown my sorrows
Why is this happening to me

It’s been a long time
Since I’ve felt truly happy
I thought I finally had it
But then everything got crappy

The thoughts are too strong
The drugs don’t help at all
I’ll write a letter to my family
Explain why I chose to end it all

I’ll sit here in the silence
Dwelling on the past
Everyone tells me
These feelings won’t last

But it’s all bullshit
How can that be true
When the only thing I can think of 
Is you

I want to tear these thoughts out

That you never left me broken
And I won’t have to end",Numb [a poem for the weak],t3_goju14,0
depression,"So I (20, F) I am a college student. My parents are paying for my tuition as well as a lot of my expenses and they are just overall heavily involved in life. My dad does my taxes and I am under their insurance. I’m just very tired of this. 

I’ve been going to therapy for many years and recently started medication always been skeptical of me and now that I’m in college, every time I come home I feel like they i’m more and more disapproving of the way I am choosing to live my life. And that’s with me only telling them very few things. They think that I act like a child and then I have behavioral issues and they use that to persuade me into thinking that I can’t do things on my own and I need them. I don’t know if it’s intentional or not but a lot of what they say is just extremely toxic and I try to talk to them about it but they just don’t listen and I get yelled at for questioning them. 

It’s gotten to the point where nothing I say works and I just feel like I’ve been kicked while sitting on the floor. Even my younger sisters just tell me to stop fighting and to just let them think what they want. But I can’t stop. I feel like they’re trying to change who I am and I don’t want that. 

It just feels odd because I grew up with a very good relationship with my family but the more and more I get older and now that I’ve seen how other families work, I realize that a lot of what they say is not OK. 

Before this gets suggested, of course I’ve thought about moving out. I don’t have the financial means nor do I think it would be a good idea at all. I would immediately go into a massive amount of debt and I can’t take that on while I’m doing my education. 

I just don’t know what to do. Fighting gets me all that and not fighting gets me all that slightly less but then I just have to put on such a painful façade around them.

depression,"People who don’t experience depression don’t understand it. The most obvious question that shows they don’t understand: 

“What are you depressed about?”

Depression doesn’t have an *about*. Sadness does. 

Depression is when your view of the world has completely flipped from the day before. Yesterday you were filled with joy, today you feel nothing, or perhaps you feel far lower than feeling nothing. You don’t know why. Nothing has obviously changed, that’s just what your mind is making you experience. 

Depression is when you know what will help things, but you can’t bring yourself to do them. Exercise, eating healthier, reaching out to someone... Logically you know they’ll help. Practically, you can’t do them. 

Depression is when you’re not interested in things you used to love. The curiosity is gone, and the passion has dried up completely. Nothing is exciting. Nothing makes you feel the joy others naturally feel.

depression,"I’ve figured that being in college, where there are 10s of thousands of goal oriented, unique students, and not being able to make friends meant there was something wrong with me.

If everyone else can form friendships and relationships then I must be doing something repulsive. My parents and therapist say theres nothing wrong, but I can’t figure out what I’m lacking.

Being friendly is only going to get you so far without a developed sense of humor. Having talent or skill in some area seems to be the only way for anyone to even want to be associated with you or respect you. I cant understand why anyone would value my opinions, thoughts and input or anything I’d have to say if I don’t have something that gives me credibility and thus my word value.  

I have adhd so I’ve always struggled with emotional regulation; I used to always get overly excited when having fun, and that would push people away. I don’t know how to regulate that and maintain my composure without completely killing the enjoyment that I may get from having the conversation. Unfortunately I’m still the type of person that will keel over laughing at the smallest, dumbest things. So I’ve really never had close friends; I’ve met people who I thought would be my friends, but I wasn’t much to them. 

I wish there was a way to make life worth living in the absence of social interactions. I don’t want to be myself anymore; it’s gotten me nowhere, and I’d be willing to be anything else.  Nothing’s going to happen if I stay this course and hope it all works out (what my counselor and parents say I need); I’m halfway through college so I don’t think I’ll develop enough to enjoy that experience.  

I never thought I was asking for too much.  Everyone else seems happy, professional help seems to indicate that there’s something I’m doing wrong, and I’m so fed up with the “find a way to love yourself” and “understanding of your value must come from you.”  If everyone wants to pretend like it’s such a mysterious quest I have to take on my own, then clearly there’s nothing worth valuing.",Having trouble making friends in college?,t3_gon2n7,0

They ignore me, yet I see them post on their stories pics of them hanging out with their other friends. They all know that I’ve been struggling for a while before quarantine started, but nobody seems to care enough to ever check up on me. I have to beg my friends to hang out and talk. Idk what’s wrong with me, they always say everything’s fine but I know it isn’t. It hurts. 

I’m going to school for recording arts, I wanna go into music production. I decided to not go to school during quarantine cause I don’t wanna waste the little money I have on online classes, when I’m paying for hands on classes. I feel really demotivated from doing anything with audio. And I’ve felt this way for a couple months before quarantine. It sucks becuase all my life since I was an infant, I’ve always wanted to something with music production. It’s always been my dream job and I was always the only one growing up who knew what they wanted to be after high school. But now that I finally have my foot in the door, I find it hard to get motivated. And it doesn’t help that my teachers constantly tell us everyday that the music industry is dead, and that we’re gonna be broke and working 12-16 hr days our entire lives.

Lately I've been thinking about this, I remember back in middle to high school had some crush on a couple of ppl and it felt so good, like when you feel butterflies and things like that, or had fear for terror movies, same with personal care because like taking showers regularly and feeling presentable before meeting someone. But at some point in my life during those years for some reason my feelings stopped working. Didn't feel any fear, love, care for myself or others, hunger ( like I'm eating just because would get sick if not), compassion gone completely, even the few friendships don't feel like something true although they care about me and they had listened to a lot of my problems it felt like they don't really care about what I said (maybe just my imagination).

 Back when I was attending college 5-6 years ago I started feeling again but only when I was drunk AF in any party with my current friends. At some point because of my lack of experience with alcohol I did something unforgivable to one of my precious friends and since then everything became worse. Stopped drinking right away, depression became worse and then became the type of person that I am now. Honestly I don't want to feel again any emotion, or drinking , or expressing any kind of thought, but if I don't do that I don't know what is going to happen with my life. I feel like if I start to socialize with someone or doing new friendships, it might happen again what happened before and don't want that.

But dammit during that time I tried my best. I was so severely suicidal that it took everything it had in me to just not do it. All my mental energy was spent trying to rebut the want to die and the hate I felt for myself for doing nothing. And I spent ages getting through the difficulty of trying to get a therapist. I with great damn difficulty managed to get out to see my friends towards the later months, but I didn't WANT to. I just had to do it to get better.

And today. Damn. For pre-face I live with my parents whom do not believe in mental illness. My mother found 2 suicide notes of mine but believed it was *le edgy phase(*Which is also partly because I tried very very hard to convince her into thinking so ngl on reflection). As such I made the concious decision to wait till I was 18 to get mental health help.

Today my dad said to my face that I ignored his advice- he said I should spend at least a Sunday with family and that if I can't manage that I shouldn't even bother with a joint honours degree. It's too much for me. He said I clearly cared more about uni and my friends than family

And while I feel a certain degree of hate towards myself- I think part of the journey has been learning to allow my anger to be outward instead of inward.

So, I'm fucking pissed. The genuine AUDACITY to think that an 18 year old will have their work-life approach completely balanced when they just started uni. The AUDACITY to think that I was completely ignoring his advice on purpose. The AUDACITY to think I HAVE to take that advice. 

But most of all, the audacity to think that I do not care about my family, when on my darkest days, on the days where I was staring at myself in the water I was going to drown myself, I thought of them. I thought of how selfish it would be to pass my pain onto all 5 of them. Not my friends, not my uni, them. He may not know this, but the fucking audacity to even assume you don't love your family truly astounds me.

He is coming from a good place, I know he is because he loves me. But this was a very very shitty way to approach it. He may have missed me because I was definetely not emotionally present, but THIS? This was not it chief.

I know I am the problem and I am not blaming anybody for it, but i am just so truly exhausted as every attempt to show affection goes down the drain because I'm ""giving too much information"" or ""being creepy"". I really feel like I'm a different species - what I find attractive, like long walls of detailed affectionate text, over-complinenting, sexual humor, weird interests, are the very things literally everyone else says is repulsive. I feel broken and torn apart that literally nothing I do, nothing I say, and nothing I like is acceptable in any way. I just want to love you... crush. But no matter how much I try not to do anything stupid, even limiting all my interaction via texts because I'm socially incapable irl, I still get ghosted and completely treated like a joke.

I support LGBT, but I can't help but feel so unbelievably sour seeing all the LGBT groups gathering and staying strong together. Autistic people are generally much rarer, and most of them don't even know they have it or are too fearful to tell anybody else. I literally cannot find anyone remotely similar to me or anyone that is patient enough to accept me and see me as a friend and it is driving me insane.

It is in mainstream schooling where tyranny of the majority can really be seen. The school refuses to tend to my special needs because ""we want to serve the interests of other students and cannot give you special treatment"". In terms of relations with classmates I have no say at all in anything and sometimes I can be dead serious when voicing an opinion and people would think I'm joking and laugh at me - all because I have no friends to back up the things I say. People can come around, whack me on the head and call me a loser and no one would call them out for it - they know my vulnerabilities and they exploit it to the maximum.

Over the years I have become absolutely hypersensitive to criticism and would cry myself to sleep at any sign of disapproval. Autism + mainstream schooling is absolutely scarring to one's mental health and sometimes I just wish I was never born. There is truly no being of the same species I can identify with, and not a single one that cares whether I die or not.

I am so. So tired of constantly lamenting my past and all the ""socially unacceptable"" things I did. Constantly questioning whether my decisions are what others would consider ""socially acceptable"", constantly feeling like a monkey in a classroom of humans, constantly feeling dirty, unwanted and a genetic disaster that's unfit to live. I just want acceptance, or death. I can't take it anymore.

Freedom of speech is a lie. It only applies to neurotypical people. For people like me, we live under constant oppression and suppression, whether it is directly or indirectly. I am so sick and I want to throw up. I'm so tired of people laughing at me,making fun of me and ostracising me and being unable to do anything about it because of the lack of like-minded people that support me.

I'm not really looking for advice, just want to vent. I hate my life so much.",Mainstream schooling is truly a torture chamber for people with autism.,t3_golcpv,0

depression,"In many ways I'm one of the luckiest people that's ever lived.  I read that human population over history has totalled roughly 100 billion.  (Over the last 100,000 years, or however they define being human).  So, given that I'm lucky enough to be in the top 1% of current global 8 billion by income (more than $32k USD per year), I could safely assume I am at least within the top 1% if not 0.1% of prosperity over all time.  Now, what does income level really mean in terms of having a good life?  Not everything of course, but mine is mostly used on true fundamental needs like food availability, safety, shelter, ability to transport myself, clothing, creative expression, etc.  And those make a real quality of life impact.  So all that is just to say, I have a lot of things to be grateful for.  And when I can be grateful, I am!  When I'm allowed to, I can find myself being immensely grateful for things like; the ability to take a hot shower every day; the fact that my food is nutritious, safe to eat, and varied; the fact that I'm alive during a time when bicycles exist and are affordable; that I'm alive when recorded music exists and is practically free!  
 I am grateful for all this and so much more; which regardless of their ubiquity, make incredible contributions to satisfaction.  But why does gratitude practice bring me sadness as well as profound contentment?  Because I know that I cannot extend my gratitude and contentment to it's logical conclusion of ""enoughness"" and completion that ultimately brings peace.


""Enoughness"" never comes.  I'll never be enough, or have enough, no matter all that I am grateful for.  I'll never be good enough, hard working enough, smart/skilled enough, or have enough wealth.  Why?  
- Firstly because our capitalist system demands ceaseless growth.  So long as our systems only function under endless growth, not only are they inherently unsustainable, but they run completely counter to our psychological nature (benefiting from gratitude, from contentment with what we already have).  Instead, we absolutely must not be satiated.  Never be completely content, we must always manufacture the demand for more consumption in order to justify more production, and in total generate larger and larger economic volume.  
- And secondly because we compete against each other to the bottom.  We praise and proselytize individualism for our citizens and meanwhile concentrate wealth, political power, and control over health care access in highly conglomerated corporations.  These corporations thus have wildly outsized influence over negotiating the individual's ability to meet basic needs (all the common sense attributes to quality of life I mentioned before) as well as to influence their government.  Splitting up citizens as individuals while concentrating economic and social power in corporations is the perfect spell for tipping the negotiative leverage and pitting the individuals against each other in pursuit the corporation's ""acceptance"" into the resources for a prosperous life.

Is it really any wonder then that so many are depressed?  that so many feel discontent with life? feel helpless against toxic comparison between each other?  that so many feel addicted to chasing excess material wealth which is about as good at bringing contentment as a scratch and sniff sticker quells hunger?  This system goes against our core needs as conscious beings, all for the service of supporting an invasive, malignant economic cancer.  It will never be enough.",Never enough,t3_gofsg3,0
depression,"If they don’t, I have no reason to live. Maybe that’s pathetic and toxic of me for relying on others to stay alive. For that I’m unsure.

At the same time I thought that by being what I deem a good sibling/daughter/or friend would be enough for people. That isn’t enough. Everyone is searching for someone else and I’m just never enough for anyone.

My sister has borderline and I truly feel lost on whether she cares about me or is stuck with me because of our finical situation. I’m tired of feeling sensitive when she doesn’t care about my emotions like I do towards her. I think my death wouldn’t affect her and for that I’m glad, but I wish I mattered to her while I’m alive. Recently we got in a fight and I’m devastated over it. Although I don’t have clear picture on what she said the dreaded feeling lingers. Something about she doesnt have sympathy for me because its my fault for not seeking help when depressed people have more resources and its an “acceptable“ mental illness than borderline/bipolar. Damn her for saying she meant it all. Now she lives her life not caring how her words affect me. How can people say harmful things and not care? She cares deeply for others, but not me. I dont know if it’s mental illness or her cold personilty. She did say bejng mean is fun, but why to your depressed sister?

depression,"I keep thinking I'm getting better. I've done so many things to improve myself both physically and mentally. I have much less social anxiety now than I used to too. But no matter how much I do, I come to realize I'm actually worse than ever. I keep getting these ups and downs where I think I'm better. I'll go a few months with no incidences what-so-ever, and then reality hits and my depression hits back worse than ever. And that's when I realize that all that hard work I've put in the past year has been for nothing and I'm actually worse than when I started. I really need to see a psychiatrist but every single one that's covered by my insurance that I've called so far is not accepting new patients. I'm almost at the bottom of the list. I think it's a sign I should give up...

I hurt everyone anyway. I don't know why but I can only seem to hurt the ones I love. So wouldn't it be better if I wasn't around at all? Idk. I've only ever once met a person who could match the level of love that I love at. And I hurt her too. I think about it everyday and it still hurts. Every. Single. Day. Fuck me I hate myself. I really really really really really really really really don't want to be alive right now but I'm too much of a pussy to end it so here I am.

My family hates me more than ever too. I think that's ehy I struggle with relationships so much. Because here at home I get no love or emotional support, so I rely on frienda for that. But obviously unless you're super duper close, you can't really expect that. I'm 99% sure my brother hates me now too and I swear I didn't do anything to deserve it. Yes, I usually do deserve it, but I swear to god I didn't do anything this time. I think my mom did something to cause it maybe. My mom also has started bullying my sister more and more lately. I try to stop it but my sister hates me too so when I try she ends up shitting on me along with my mom. I hate this. And because of the quarantine I can't even escape the abuse anymore. I deserve the abuse though. Or at least, I've finally been convinced by my mom that I deserve it. I'm such a burden on my family. I know for a fact they'd love it if I would just kick the bucket.

My psychologist recommended that I send an email to my boss to explain that my mental health hasn't been great and if it was possible to have additional help in the area I work.  Surprise surprise, I received my boss' reply this afternoon and she said no.  My boss said if I have any problems I should reduce my hours.

I was already looking for work on and off, but now I'm over it and need to leave that job as soon as I find a new one.  I've been stuck in this job for almost 2 years and I don't get the support (financially, emotionally etc.) to encourage me in the slightest to stay.

Not sure if I have an bipolar disorder but in the course of the last few years I had so many downs (some which really had no reason to exist in the first place) and ups (where I literally looked forward to live my life) in my life but currently I just feel like I'm depressed and empty so I assume It's another ''downfall''.

I can't hold relationships because of my down phases. I abandon every person and everything around me when I have my downs, which makes me more sad to be honest cause I don't have many friends left. Most of the people already left me and I am a mere joke or attention seeking hoe to them. I even skipped many classes because of my demotivation and now these rumors and jokes which are revolving around me skipping because I am ''dumb'' are making me feel more uncomfortable in school then ever before. 

In my ups I am a cheerful and positive person but I get attached really easily so then the loss of the person while I have my down hurts even more.

Currently I am not looking forward to live my life with this pattern and I doubt that I will ever fully trust a person. I hate myself for being like that.

depression,"Hey all. This is my first post to this sub. I’ve been here for a while but have been too scared to post. But here I go. I’ve been clean for about a month. Mood swings here and there but nothing too bad, but then these last few days have been horrible. See, I’ve been talking to this girl and we both have feelings toward each other, but she doesn’t have the more relationship feelings like me. She has the more “Let’s fuck around since I’m single now” kind of feelings. We’ve known each other since she was in her relationship and she’s constantly flirted with me, and I know she cheated on her ex. I was cheated on 3 times, so I know how her ex feels (if she ever tells him). I don’t know why I still fall for her, y’know? I mean she makes me feel all of the shit ive been through for the last few years. My mind gets so clouded with emotions and dark thoughts of what I’ve been through and how she could possibly hurt me, i can’t hardly function. I’m snappier with my friends and family, and even my dog, which absolutely kills me because he’s the most adorable little creature. But the way I’ve been able to deal with this all... is cutting. When I cut, it helps clear my mind by making me focus on the physical pain rather then the mental, if that makes any sense. It doesn’t feel good to cut, but it’s relieving in a way. My whole left forearm is all cut up. And touching them right now still hurts a bit. I hate having to cut so I can actually sleep for more then 5 hours a night. And I’ve talked to friends, it’s the same thing. “Try not to cut, I’m here for you” Yeah sure that’s why when I message you you dont look at it for hours when you’re active right now, got it, thanks.

The closest time I had a girl best friend was in 5th grade, she made me feel loved in the way I wanted to. Not the benefits way. She didn’t give me hugs but I wanted them. She always said the most positive things about me around her friends. She always thought about me when we were like in break, I’d always make her laugh, and she’d always be with me in like lunch.

I go to work at a meaningless job that pays just enough for the bare necessities, and by the time my shift is over, I'm too physically exhausted and/or in pain to want to do anything else.

I've noticed that when I get to work, I have this auto-pilot ""happy and polite"" mode.  I don't care for anyone at my job, but I have to act friendly for some reason.  When I go sit in my car on break, however, I melt into an emotionally exhausted puddle.  I don't care in the least bit about my performance, or any of those people.  It all means nothing.

I've been struggling with loneliness a lot more, as well.  I feel a million miles away from the world, like I'm floating outside of my own body, watching my life like it's a shitty movie.  I feel like I can't talk about my feelings with anyone, because no one really understands.  I want to feel connected to my fiance so bad, but he struggles with anxiety and I always feel like I have to put up this front, or else he feels like he did something wrong or that it's his fault.

depression,"Hi everyone, I’m not sure where i should have posted this so I’m sorry if I’m on the wrong subreddit.

**Background story**

I started some new medication recently including Lamotrigine, that is supposed to help regulate my mood. I’ve been depressed as a teen between 15 and 19, and on antidepressant for 6 months (January 2019-July 2019). before stopping because it made it worse. 

My depression got better after I stopped for some reason, but then anxiety kicked in. I would get panick attacks, I’d be thinking that everyone hates me, thinking they all lie and stuff, ... 

Anyway, I got diagnosed with ADHD recently and anxiety disorders, so I’m on both adhd medication and Lamotrigine. The ADHD medication help me to focus and feel a bit less anxious during the day. I didn’t take Lamotrigine long enough to see a difference in my mood. 

**My current problem :**

Since 2 weeks now, I’ve been feeling super good the mornings : confident, happy, motivated, ... and extremely down the evenings : feeling worthless, crying, thinking I shouldn’t exist, ... 

I don’t understand what’s going on. I haven’t felt depressed like this in almost a year. But at the same time I haven’t felt that good during the day in a very long time.

I really try not let their comments get to me but as of lately it’s been constantly replaying in my head and I try not to cry about it but sometimes I break especially now that we’re stuck in quarantine and I’m always in my room avoiding any contact. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about it ever because no one I know can understand what I feel or go through when they (my parents) say things. A part me feels like I feel more vulnerable to their comments lately because of the way they say them otherwise I think I’d be alright but this has just gotten super consistent and if their comments aren’t about my weight they’re about my personality and how I’m always happy and how I need to tone it down.

Her presence has helped me see more and more good days recently. I've spent 6 days undepressed last month. But then I fell back into the darkness.

I am slipping out again. I haven't really been depressed since yesterday. Our area faced an extremely bad natural disaster the day before yesterday. All of us are affected one way or another. The night before that was my worst night in years - my depression was on overdrive, I couldn't sleep, stayed up staring at the walls as a thousand voices told me that I never deserve anything good or a partner I can call my own, I felt a crippling loneliness. When I grew tired and fell asleep, the dreams were so bad that I woke up startled and sobbed as the voices started speaking again. I survived somehow. After sunrise, I spoke to my friend and she sent me something that finally anchored me.

In this precarious time, when I'm supposed to be sad or worried, I find myself in a clear, good mood. My friend is stranded at her home, with no power, bad cell reception and limited supply of water. I find myself constantly worrying about her, I feel helpless. I feel angry at the authorities that are not doing enough. I feel all of it, but it's as if my feelings lack intensity.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know if I feel the fear of losing my loved ones. I do love them, I know that. But why don't I feel things the way I used to? I don't have any way of coping with this sort of mood. I feel like a psychopath. I feel like an asshole. Why don't I feel the things I felt the way I used to? What's wrong with me?

depression,"So I have been depressed since 2005, ruined my life and education due to that. Now I believe myself to be of well above average intellect. I loved science, Logic, and maths in school and excelled very well in those. Most of my teachers assumed that I was heading for the stars. May become some big engineer or scientist. I am intelligent but not people smart. Due to depression I went into a hypothetical corner and isoleted myself for a long time. I wanted friends but never knew what to talk with anyone. I would just bore them out of their skulls. that is in past now. But the depression took a toll on me.

Recently I read a post on r/books where OP stated that he never realized that his sudden loss of interest in reading was an indication of depression. Well, In school I was what you can only call a voracious reader.I read at least 3 books a week. all 100+ pages at least. but after I passed school in 2004, Especially since 2007, I have read less than 10 books. I cant read a paragraph without starting to yawn uncontrollably. I bought myself A Song Of Ice And Fire book set on my birthday in 2015. Have not read the first book even halfway. I also found that in college I could not study for 15 minutes before beginning yawning. Even the subject was the one I liked or I actually wanted to study.

I am good with logic and will excel well in programming. I love tech and computers. I even took a project as a hobby but could not go ahead of first 2 UI (unprogrammed) pages . Its not that I do not have interest, but i just can not do anything when it comes to brain taxing time. this is dragging me down and now I am standing on the edge of bankruptcy . I want to start again. But i do not know what would I do if all i can do is yawning after 15 minutes. HELP.

Maybe I should start with my name. My name is Hayden. I am 26 years old. At this moment I am very depressed. It was triggered by many, many factors, but mainly it was a really bad trip I had after smoking weed and the 6.4 earthquake hitting Nevada during the peak of it. I thought I was going to die. I thought the world was ending. It made me realize how cowardly I was and how sheltered I've been living my whole life.  


Some things about me are that I've never had a job of any kind. I've been living like a child living off my mother. I play video games and watch youtube videos all day. I rarely exercise, rarely go outside or anything. OCD was a big factor in this. The best way to describe this is to watch this clip taken from the show Game Grumps [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8PUDA6hU2Q). I'm also dealing with porn addiction as a result of being sheltered my whole life. But that's another story on its own.  


So that's me. I'm very overweight. Very much a beta male. Any attempt of trying to change myself only resulted in me giving up and slipping back to where I was but worse than before. I have and had very little friends. I get angry over nothing. I get angry over things in the past that repeat in my head. I end up hating everyone I meet.

depression,"I am new to Reddit and really hoping this would help. It’s going to be a long one, so brace yourselves. (Humor is my way of staying afloat) I have been married a decade, with the most wonderful man I could imagine. We have a 5yo. He cheated on me last year, with his brother’s wife.(I KNOW!) This has been against his personality and even after a year has passed, I am unable to get over it. We had our fair share of fights, violent ones I am afraid and have considered separating many many times. Thing is, the idea of breaking up my family we built just kills me. My child starts crying at the mention of being away from either of us. I have tried therapy, medication, meditation, self-help books and articles, what have you. Nothing has worked. I am haunted by vivid images of them (*insert tremendously callous name calling) together. I have sleepless nights and have slipped into a terrible depression. I have been suicidal as well, I confess. Four attempts and couldn’t go through with it. My husband, after the initial confession, has been hugely dismissive and has pretty much swept it under the carpet. He gets violently furious every time I bring it up. The fights have traumatized my child and he says he has nightmares and has developed anxiety. I promised him two months ago there won’t be anymore fights and have kept my promise. Just the other day, I had a serious bout of the blues and had suggested to my husband hashing it out a little. We were driving in the car at the time. He got furious and started yelling and driving like a maniac, saying I am a parasite and don’t deserve to live the life I am living. I asked him to pull over, got my child out of the car and walked away. He drove away. We were both crying on the road for 30 minutes before we got a cab. I had no phone or money on me. He apologized the next day. I haven’t spoken to him since and have told him I want to separate. It’s killing me, but I feel like it is the right thing to do. Amongst all this, my mind won’t stop sending me flashes of the guttersl*t screwing my husband. I have extremely violent thoughts and have to distract myself with TV or reading. I have tried journaling and it just reads like a sick homicidal maniac’s writing. 
I am currently on medication and my vices are limited to couple beers a day. I am a full-time mom, and dare I say, a pretty good one for most part. It would be so nice to hear something reassuring from people. I have just been relying on hugs from my child to make myself feel better. Please help!

depression,"Hi, this is my first post here, I've never really told anyone but my girlfriend this, because every time I start trying to talk to anyone about any of this, they downplay my entire situation and act like I'm an idiot. After reading the posts here, I feel like you will all be able to at least to some extent understand what I'm going through and give me some of your insight. I'm not really sure how to order these things or how to properly talk about them, so I apologize if I come off as a bit erratic. So again, this will be in bad order and probably not be an easy read. 

To start, I've been dealing with severe depression since a young age (12) and I'm now 29 years old, soon to be 30. I have zero friends aside from my girlfriend, every friend I've ever had during my life has either turned into a drug addict, proven that they were only my friend to use me, or doesn't find my friendship convenient for them anymore. I'm the type who prefers to be alone most of the time, but the utter loneliness of literally not having any friends just kills me inside. The absolute best that I can get out of even the people who were once ultimately my BEST friends, is being left on read when I reach out to them on Facebook. They can't even be bothered to talk to me through Facebook. That is literally the easiest and most effortless way of keeping in touch with someone, but no one can even give me that. A lot of people in similar situations usually feel like they're the problem, that something must be wrong with them. But I don't feel that way, I KNOW I'm a good friend and a very good person. So this is extremely mind-numbing and frustrating to me that no one wants to talk to me or be my friend. 

I've had plenty of ways that I've tried coping with various different issues throughout the years, the two biggest of which are Runescape and achievement hunting on Xbox, but this is where my most recent mental anguish begins... I for some reason have a brain that's constantly telling me that if I'm not the absolute best, or perfect at something, that it's a waste of my time and that I shouldn't bother with it. With Xbox, I feel like my account needs to have 100% of the achievements unlocked in every single game I play. I've made multiple accounts over the years and they all eventually get ruined for one reason or another. I've actually had month long stints where I'd just sit there and do nothing all day because I was unable to decide whether I wanted to make a new account, deal with my current one, or play Runescape instead. But then I'm left in the position where I know I'm nowhere close to being #1 or ever could be. Recently I've started to accept that for Runescape, but I am still depressed about it alot.

I have a LOT of health issues, and I mean a LOT. Just in the last 3 years, I've been bitten by a tick and got a weird tick-born illness that has yet to even be diagnosed. (It isn't lyme) but the biggest suspect is Bartonella. I have muscle spasms almost 24/7, feel very weak and sick, and am always tired because of that. I had a hernia in my groin repaired two years ago, and I've been left with large amounts of chronic pain ever since, that no one will help me with. I've been to plenty of dr's and hospitals for it, but no help. I'm going bald, and the only way I've ever felt attractive and good about myself is when I had long hair. Because of my severe depression, and all of my other issues, I have for years neglected to take care of my body in ways you couldn't imagine. I lost all of my teeth at the age of 24 simply because I didn't take care of them. I didn't care about myself, and I still don't. There are a few more but they are a bit personal. I feel ridiculously ugly, to the point that I actually feel like my girlfriend is just in a long-running joke and pretending to like me. It's like I can't fathom another human being finding me attractive, it just doesn't make sense. I dropped out of highschool due to being bullied, TWICE. Yes, twice. I was lucky enough to get back in by doing summer school and other things, but when I got back it was more of the same. I was tormented from grade 7 the whole way up until 10th grade (which I repeated two times) and eventually couldn't do it anymore. That makes me feel like a massive loser. I have a thick skin, but when people call me a loser, that one actually cuts because I believe in my mind that to be completely true. I've only ever had one job in my life, McDonalds, but I couldn't handle being around people at that point because I started having extremely terrible social anxiety at a highschool age because of the bullying. I just feel like everyone's out to get me. It's actually so bad that when I go outside on the rare occasions that it does happen, I literally think every person I see is going to murder me or do something to hurt other people around me. 

There have been times before I wasn't in a relationship where I would lay in bed all day every day for literally 5-6 months at a time, only stopping that cycle when I was stupid enough to believe someone was my friend would enter my life briefly. Because of this, even though I'm almost 30, I feel like I have as much life experience as a 15 year old, and I don't have many memories, because most of them are exactly the same. Just, harrowing depression and sitting in a dark room doing nothing. I feel it should be mentioned that RS and Xbox have primarily been what has gotten me through up until about 2 years ago. That is when the perfectionist mindset sunk in. I have no idea why, and I don't even know why I care about it. I just cannot get it out of my head that I have to be perfect. Maybe it's because after everything that I've been through, I did something that felt like a huge accomplishment and now my brain craves that feeling? Possibly doing that multiple times have upped the anti and now I need to be absolutely perfect. I don't know. 

I feel extremely lucky to at least be able to tell anyone reading this, that a dream of mine since I was very young was to be a father. As of two years ago, I am one. I know he doesn't have anything to do with my perfectionist mindset, I only say that because those are two significant things that both happened two years ago. Right now, I truly believe him and my girlfriend are the only two things in this world that are keeping me from ending my life. I've continued to hit new lows over the years, sometimes within weeks or even days of one another.. But even with that said, no matter how bad I've ever felt, with my son I feel like I could never hurt myself. That doesn't mean I don't want to though. I want to die more than almost anything, with the exception of being a good father. 

I feel like because of how randomly I pieced that all together, that I probably missed a lot of things that would have been major parts of my post. But I feel like it's good enough now. I just wanted someone to hear what I've been holding in all these years. I didn't go into very much detail in many things, that's because I don't want to make someone read this for a week. If anyone would ever be interested in me sharing stories from my childhood and teenage years I'd be happy to. An example would be how in Jr. Highschool, I played with Pokemon cards, other kids would come to my table, take the cards and throw them in the trash. Then they would pour chocolate milk on my head, and later kick me in the back, causing me to fly down the concrete steps, and hit me in the head with their heavy books. That was just ONE day of Jr high for me. So I'm sure you'll understand why I didn't go into detail about the bullying I've endured. Thank you for reading, I just want to know if anyone out there relates to me so I don't have to feel so alone.",Struggling with depression and perfectionism,t3_go52eh,0
depression,"I had this idea for a while and it is something I usually notice while reading online comments.
I will start with autism and ocd, and finish with depression, so if zou are interested only in that, read the last paragraph.
Disclaimer: I am a student but not of medicine, psychology and philosophy. I am bound to be wrong somewhere.

There are a lots of comments about autism. How it is caused by vaccines,  older mothers etc. But, some comments imply that autism is just different, they are little socially awkward. I saw a youtube video where father was explaining difficulties raising his autistic daughter. Not being able to hold small talk is not autism. She didn'h have much control about what things overwhelmher emotionally.

Most of us save file twice, reread email twice. But. That is not ocd, like the internet people  like to say they are for doing that. Another video I saw is where guy talks about his ocd and how his girlfriend left him. He also had no control about locking the door multiple times, turning lights on and off. It is sad to hear about it. He realizes it is pointless, but cant stop himself.

Similar misconceptions are circling around for depression, and it doesn't help anybody. From people saying it is brain malfunction and can only decrease the effect with chemicals to you are only sad it will pass.

I have been 'really sad' for extended period of time, but never checked myself because of social stigma of going to psychiatrist. Did it pass, or am i shutting myself in so i have less chance of getting sad again? I don't know. But I think we could benefit for using the right cure for the right treatment. To look into ourselves. Assume one thing, and try to fix it. If the fix doesnt work, either try something different, or change the assumption. Dont think you are depressed if you take a deeper look and see you just want one part of your life to change for the better
 And dont think you are not depressed because you think depression is for the weak or something. Neither body nor mind are perfect, and everything happens to everybody, but it is not the end.

depression,"To start, I'm a 22 year old. I never thought I had clinical depression because I never really had suicidal thoughts or anything along those lines.

I've been in a state the past couple years where I'm just not that happy. Like I can experience joy and have fun while going out/gaming with friends but over the past couple years I've become a lot more introverted, anxious and severely lack motivation. Im not very happy when Im just alone and usually just feel bored or a bit anxious (I don't have anxiety attacks that cause trouble breathing or anything like that but there are times where I'm very anxious and it can happen somewhat randomly)

I was an extremely good student through elementary school, freshman and sophomore year. Then in junior year I started having more issues with my sleep patterns and started missing more classes. In senior year I actually dropped out of my very first classes of the day (both semesters) and often missed or showed up late to 2nd period. Honestly I still did well in class and understood all the material (I honestly found it very boring if anything. I won't pretend I was a genius or something but most things came pretty easily to me and I wasn't being stimulated at all) -- however my grades slipped a lot because for whatever reason attendance and homework get marked heavily even if I theoretically got 99 on every test/essay/assignment/exam.

I took a gap year and never went to post secondary. I'd work a job for a while, take a small break then start a new job. That was the pattern until 2019 where I didn't work at all (started working again early 2020). I didn't work most of 2019 partly due to being self conscious. I went from being pretty fit/attractive to putting on some weight during my first few months off and none of my clothes fit that well and I generally just didn't wanna be seen in public.   

I feel like I'm failing in life but I somehow have no motivation to fix it. I know what some of my goals are but don't have the motivation to go for them. A big part of the problem is that I don't know what I want to do as a career and the thought of wasting all that time/money kinda stresses me out.

I've also noticed that in the last year or so I've become a lot more paranoid. I check the doors to my rooms several times before leaving the house (to make sure the cats can't get in and jump all over my stuff), sometimes I check that the door to my house is locked several times (sometimes even walking away for 30 seconds just to turn back and check again even if I'm just taking a short walk to the store or something). I'll pat down my pockets occasionally to make sure I still have my headphones/phone/keys etc. And even before the pandemic started I found that I was washing my hands more and even rinsing off cans/drinks that I bought at the store (I don't even know what sparked this)

I think checking all my doors so often is partly money related. I'm not super broke or anything but if something valuable were broken or stolen I wouldn't have a very easy time replacing it.

I have ADHD (diagnosed since I was very young) and maybe even some kind of sleep disorder (I've been borderline nocturnal the past few years) but idk if I should be seeking professional help or anything like that because idk if there's anything to actually diagnose.

Also idk if this is related in ANY way but I'm not a *super* sleepy person by any means but something about cuddling just knocks me out. Maybe this is completely normal but I could sleep 12 hours, my girlfriend would come over 2 hours after I woke up and I'd just pass the fuck out.

depression,"My life sucks, I mean it really fucking sucks.
I had a good fun childhood till age 12 when I moved from Sweden to Spain because my parents had found I good opportunity in the public agent business.
It was really hard to leave all my friends but I figured I’d make new better friends in my new country. Wrong.
My parents set me up to online school which I failed (no surprise as I’m not motivated in doing schoolwork anyway) , so then I tried a spanish school.
I had a hard time making any friends what so ever since I barely knew the language and not knowing the language I failed on multiple subjects which lead to me leaving the school and retrying the online school I was originally meant to be doing. This is just in 7th grade btw.
Skip forward to the start off the summer and I went back to Sweden over the summer.
My friends changed a lot and had already hit puberty (which I hadn’t) and that made me feel left out but that wasn’t such a big deal. The problem with being back in Sweden is that we sold our house that was the literal center of where all my friends lived and we bought this tiny little house 2 hours away so that took away a lot of quality time with my friends.
Skip forward end of summer and I’m starting 8th grade.
Me and my brother was isolated all day because of out online school and our self esteem and confidence shrunk lower day by day and soon enough we basically had lost our personality.
Next summer I thought was gonna be better than last one bur of course my world don’t work like that.
Me and my friends never had anything to talk about and I had to make up ridiculous stories just to get out of the awkward silence zone.
Believe it or not I never felt unhappy or depressed through out these 2 years of shitness but all of that would change when I started 9th grade.
As usual it was just work work work until you got done and then watch tv or something.
I finished all of my assignments really early so I went to Sweden earlier than usual to meet my friends and try to build a stronger bond with them like it used to be.
But my friends had all girlfriends and we had literally nothing to talk about ever so it always had to be me and at least 2 other people so they can have conversations and I could just jump in and say a few lines and laugh at the not so funny jokes they were making and of course me making up fake stories from my imagination to claim myself as “the funny one” in our friend group.
I had some girl-friends who I crushed on but got rejected on all of them every time I asked if they wanted to be more than friends. It was also really hard to ask if someone wanted to hang because I always felt like they don’t actually like me and just thinks I’m annoying when I’m with them and the only true friend I had was this curly headed guy we can call Hugo who I smoked weed with sometimes. Idk, Hugo was just really easy to talk to but one day he got sick, really sick and couldn’t leave his house for months which made me stay up and nights just thinking of bad thoughts because without Hugo, I’m nothing. And without Hugo I’m just realizing how fucking boring my real childhood life had been.

Not long before my 11th birthday it turned into screaming; clawing at my throat Panic attacks (which carried on until a few years ago) and during  secondary school it slowly became Depression. 

Apathy: also came in secondary school when I stopped caring about school and just didn't have the want nor wish to be there, with a slipping emotional attachment to whatever friends I had. 

My whole last year I attended school for probably less than 2 months of it 

The Depression got worse when i was lying there in bed one day 'probably' not doing so good and out of nowhere memories came back to me like water forcing its way out of a crack, cleary something me as a child forced to the deepest parts of my mind and wanted to forget it all. 

It worked for a time but not long enough. 

Anger: came when I started forgetting things like what I had just done, why I opened the fridge, what I was looking for or If i had done something yesterday and thought I had just done it today, 

everytime it happenes I get this horrible disorentating feeling in my head like someone shining a torch in your eyes in the dark but with humming needles in my brain and to much visual or audio input does this aswel

depression,"The reality is there are less oppressed people and there are highly oppressed people. This system of oppression makes the world improve through the motivation of envy.

Envy is the pain that someone feels when he/she senses the other has better fortune than himself/herself. An existential dread that motivates the Envious to seek better fortune or in other cases, destroy the fortune of others so that other Envious people would have easier competition.

Some divide Envy into benign or invidious, each with its own consequences and motivations. For me, it is neither because for me good or evil depends on the existential perception of the individual (eg. pain for a masochist is good) wherein the intrinsic or natural fluctuates through the present situation of the individual. Envy is the pain that is felt because the other exists in a better state than himself or herself, a pain that results from an error in congruence of the Envy not being solved.

However, through this, the world somehow improves because its beings are constantly Envious of each other. If these beings stopped being Envious and just settle for the their current oppressive state and do nothing, the individual loses hope, a state that is worse than envy itself.

The world antagonizes Envy, saying it is detrimental but for me, Envy makes the beings of this world motivated, sometimes to exist or unexist. 

Envy suppressed and unacted is depression; Envy acted upon is living; Envy dying as a consequence of becoming one with your desired state is success. That state of 'dead envy' as success makes other people Envious and the cycle goes on and as the standard goes up, this improves the world as a whole through each individual's cycle of envy.",Envy is the motivation that improves the world,t3_gofvof,0
depression,"Dear r/depression, 

I’ve wanted to post here for a while, maybe a year or so. I’ve decided that maybe now as my depression is getting worse than ever now might be the time. This is a bit of a long post but I did my best to make it interesting.

Just about as long as I can remember I’ve suffered from mental illnesses. From depression to seeing things that aren’t actually there. These things I see normally being rather disturbing, but that’s not really what this post is about. As of late my depression has taken a turn for the worst. But I think it may help if I gave some more backstory into my life and maybe why I may be this way.

As far as I remember I’ve had mentally and sometimes physically abusive parents. My mom and my dad hate each other with a passion, I honestly don’t know why they haven’t gotten a divorce yet. They fight every other day all that. I also really feel like I am the least favorite child as well, parents always say they don’t have a favorite but that’s an absolute lie. 

Anyways, as previously stated, my depression has gotten much worse recently. I’ve began cutting myself and punching the wounds when I feel like it doesn’t hurt enough. I used cry myself to sleep most nights but now I can’t seem to cry anymore.

Some in the comments may say, “Why don’t you reach out to your parents and ask them for help?” But it’s not that simple. In the past I’ve tried reaching out for help, but they would always claim that I’m not depressed. Some then may say “Oh then reach out to someone else.” But I’ve done that as well.

Today I started having thoughts that I should just end it all, at the moment it’s not a matter of if, but when. Some may say “But you’ll be missed.” But I really don’t think I will be.

However, I found almonds to be incredibly helpful just for getting some kind of sustenance, even when you have no motivation at all to eat. They’re super small, and can be eaten one at a time if your stomach is particularly unsettled - they also have a simple and inoffensive flavor (although there are a variety of flavors available, if that’s more your thing). They have healthy fats and are fairly calorie dense, which can be a big help especially if eating has become an irregular occurrence. They’re also incredibly easy, as they don’t require any preparation aside from simply opening the bag.

Other nuts are also a great choice if you don’t care for almonds, those are just what I found I preferred.

But what the hell do people do on a daily basis?

I can get my chores and shit done in like 15 minutes. I'm not working right now so typically spend probably 23 hours a day in bed...

I just want to live my freakin life! People make me feel like a burden for having medical problems. I feel like people just want to throw me away. I just want a safe zone, like kind that Link can use in The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass.

depression,"I'm struggling so much right now. I know that overall in the grand scheme of things, that I'm fortunate enough to have shelter, food, and a job (which I absolutely hate). But I can't help but feel like shit everyday - opening my eyes up in the morning, pushing myself out of bed to grab water just to crash back to bed. I have been working from home recently, my appetite, sleep schedule, moods, and thoughts have all been fluctuating crazily. Sometimes in a single day I feel all the emotions, sometimes I just feel dead. I feel so hopeless, the work (programmer here) I am doing makes me feel so disconnected from the realities of everyday people. 

I haven't stopped taking care of myself, I still take showers, I still force myself to eat, I still try to maintain some sleep (even though I still feel sleepy all day). I do some yoga in the morning when I can push myself enough to do it, which makes me feel motivated for a moment but that dies down as the day progresses. I still can push myself to clean my room. I still try to connect with my friends. Nothing helps. 

I have been taking Diazepam to self-medicate, and it has been helping me sleep, and for some reason it makes me feel more awake and productive sometimes. I have also been taking it as a way to relax and chill out and it works. I don't know what to feel, I don't know what to think. Everything just feels **wrong**. I don't know where to turn to. Nothing makes sense. I feel tired. I have been feeling this way since I was in my teens. When I speak up about it; the answers are always to the tune of: ""Well, **everyone** is depressed and stressed out"". But the stress I am experiencing, it feels like I am slowly killing myself. I'm under heavy student loans, working a job straight after college. I need a fucking break. I can't take it anymore. And you know what's the craziest part?! I could feel completely fine as if nothing was ever wrong tomorrow. Like a flip of a switch.

I was on Valdoxan a few months back, I stopped seeing the doctor for no particular reason. Valdoxan made me feel dead inside more dead than it already was. It made me feel less sad and made me think less. Yes I tried meditation, mindfulness, therapy. And now the only thing keeping me going is this Benzodiazepine, and I am fully aware of the risks associated with it. I feel so fucking lost.","Just when it seems to have gone away.

depression,"Hi. So I have been talking to a guy for the past 3-ish months, I've had days in which I sleep in all day or I'm just so low we barely speak, he asked about this behavior a couple of times and I brushed it off because I didn't really feel ready to share yet. However, last night it got really bad. I felt so empty and depressed and I really wanted to hurt myself, spent like an hour dwelling on it, he was asleep and at around 2am he woke up. And I just spilled everything out, told him about my past, when it all started, I used to be a cutter, I told him about my scars and then I explained what had happened while he was asleep. He was worried and he seemed pretty understanding, he asked a couple of things and tried his best to be helpful. He also asked me to seek professional help. But, he said he didn't know how he felt about the whole thing, said that he's never been in a situation like this before. And today he's been kind of distant.

This all started a month ago during which time I was very unstable. And one night at around 3 in the morning I started acting erratic at home and making suicidal threats and my mom called the cops on me.  I ended up getting taken into custody and had a half gram of coke and a couple bars on me. I was put on suicide watch in the ER for around 3 days then was transferred to a psych unit for a week.

depression,"I was the first son to my parents, I have two older sisters. I have a younger sister too and until my brother came along, my dad and me were the only boys in the family. My dad was technically an orphan, adopted by his grandparents because my grandmother was so young when she had him. If you're familiar with Jack Nicholson's upbringing, it was like that. My dad was raised thinking his mother was his sister and was told his grandparents were his biological parents. Thing is, my dads adoptive parents were old. They had already raised four kids to adulthood when their youngest (my grandmother) had my dad and dropped them off with him. So, because of their old age, they didn't have the energy to raise another kid (my dad's words).

My dad's dad (my grandfather) took off immediately and I never would have a grandfather from either side in my life, a lot of which I was desperate for positive male role models. My father is a big man, 6'1"" and he's been working out for whole life. His biceps and shoulders are massive, he's basically a body builder. Meanwhile, my physical features? Well, I'm an adult now and I'm 5'8"". Much shorter (my mum's side is a lot shorter), and even as a child I was always the short kid. Whenever anyone would see me with my dad, they'd often comment ""How did YOU come from HIM?"" In a world where basically everyone was bigger than you, my dad was absolutely ginormous. He was incredibly physically intimidating, and he knew it, and he'd use it to cower me into submission.

My dad would smack us, I know that isn't that bad, but it got way beyond the slap on the bottom and lasted up until my late teens. Usually I was hit because I had annoyed my sisters and my dad, always soft to the girls (wanting to be the daddy in daddy's girl), would just hit me. Sometimes he wouldn't bother getting out of bed or off his chair, so he'd tell me to come to him. He'd tell me he'd just wanna talk and even kinda sound nice and understanding then WHAM! He'd use his giant forearms to smack me across the head, and they hurt. Smacks to the head were common and could come at anytime. He'd smack me for saying something dumb or embarrassing or disrespecting him. It got to a point where I started flinching when my dad would reach out to me, even for a pat or hug. Now I'm always flinching. I'll flinch when my fiancee tries to hug me when we're laying in bed at night.

I guess I should be lucky that it never came to closed fist blows, like I've read with some kids. It seemed it stopped right there, though. Wooden spoons and belts were also used along with hairpulling. One of the earliest memories I have is of my dad dragging my oldest sister by her hair. What I wanna stress though is my father's sheer size. He was huge and he would purse his lips and his eyes would turn red with rage, it was incredibly frightening. He'd scream and swear so loud my ears would hurt. He would drink a lot and sometimes he would come home apoplectic. I remember one time he came home and I had fallen asleep next to my mum in their bed. I woke up to him coming home and he told me to go to my room. I was reluctant and said ""Aw, do I have to?"" Out of nowhere, my dad used his giant hands to cup my tiny head, violently pull me towards him so that his enraged eyes were inches away from mine and said with deep anger ""GET THE FUCK OUT"" and threw me out of his bedroom, slamming the door behind. I was in shock. I didn't know what the fuck that was. It was almost primal, savage and it greatly affected me. I remember just standing on the other side of the door, sobbing, not knowing what to think.

Christmas time has always been a tough time of year for me, but I never really knew why? It's taken me a long time to be able to comprehend and vocalize my grievances. My parents loved to have a good time. They'd always have people over to stay up late and party. I can't tell you how many nights I had to try to go to sleep to thumping music and loud conversations. Not to mention all the drunken friends coming into my room, their kids running around, while I tried to play video games or read. Christmas was when this really amped up. Because not only did my parents love partying, they also loved camping, for weeks at a time, Christmas holidays were perfect for that. But camping was just an excuse to party. Along with all our camping supplies, they made sure to have plenty of booze and other substances, which are very expensive in my home country. They'd also be travelling with a large group of their friends too, who a lot were drunk, trashy losers. I was a more indoorsy kid who liked computers and books and didn't really get a lot of fun from camping. I found it uncomfortable with few benefits. But was I ever asked or made to feel in anyway important to the family? When I started getting into my teens, my complaints basically became famous in the family. It was joked about. ""Oh, idontwearpants doesn't wanna go camping again this year. Too bad we're forcing him."" My dad would force me to come by guilting me saying we needed ""family time together"". Well, getting black out drunk with your buddies while your son silently sits in the corner is a strange way of a family spending time together. Being exposed to all sorts of weird and gross shit at an early age totally affected me. I'm reminded of another story, where we just go back from 2 weeks of camping (and of course, boozing) and my mum, offhand, said ""We coulda spent the money to go see the snow. But we decided to go camping instead."" I had never seen the snow, I'd always wanted to, I still haven't seen it, in fact, even at 29. But my parents would rather choose the vacation that allowed more opportunity to get drunk with their friends.

What I wanted or thought or felt was never really taken into the equation. I just had to learn to deal with it or put up with it. I remember a good friend of mine told me how his little brother decided where the family would go for vacation. I remember thinking ""What? He was allowed to help choose? How?!"" We lived in the same house for a very long time, and when my parents moved in it was a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom. Not long after I arrived, my parents decided to make a major upgrade to the house. The upgrade? A pool. They had a newborn boy and they decided the best upgrade would be a pool. Not a room for himself and maybe a second bathroom? Nah, we wanna have fun. This typifies how I was regarded in the family. There are five kids in the family, despite all the camping trips and other big purchases they made, our house stayed at 3 bedrooms 1 bath. Sharing rooms, especially with my mean older sister, was awful. I woulda killed for my own room, I was even living in the crappy treehouse out back because I was so desperate. We'd have to fight over the bathroom. My brother in law bought a very similar house to ours a few years ago and almost immediately added rooms onto it.

He never really spent time with me. He had a work injury early in my childhood that prevented him from doing a lot of super active things. So if I asked him to do something he'd usually say ""his back is too sore"" and I'd just drop it. I remember a few movies, and he'd watch my soccer games when I was in primary school but that's kind of it. He never sat me down and talked to me about women or the world. Both my parents would get frustrated and angry at me for not knowing things. Things I was never told to begin with that they thought was just common sense. Calling me stupid and an idiot. Dad would ridicule things I showed interest in. Dumb stuff at my age, but it basically meant I never wanted to open up to him. He'd embarrass me in front of my friends, in cruel ways though. I remember my friends came over to mine so that my dad could take us to an internet cafe. At the last second he decided he wouldn't do it and was making fun of me, dancing around saying he wouldn't take me in front of me and my friends. So not only was I embarrassed, my friends were pissed. At me and him. It was embarrassing to have friends over, we had pets that would shit everywhere and laundry everywhere, dirty kitchen, beer cans from one of my parents' parties. I couldn't bring friends over, or when I did, something horrifying would inevitably happen. The worst being drunk friends of my parents trying to interact with us.

So, all this culminates into the man I am today. Panic attacks, anxiety, depression, very low-self worth, submissive. Don't know how much is to blame on my childhood and my parents, mostly my dad, but the more I think about it the more I imagine how different my life would've been if my dad didn't use his huge figure to physically intimidate me. Where I grew up to eventually see him as a fellow man and not someone that dominates me with not just his size, but his guilt too. I know one thing for sure. With my children I'll make them feel important. I won't put partying and wanting to have a good time in front of my son's happiness and well being. My parents had had my two older sisters for a while before I came along, and I guess they didn't see much different about raising a boy. Not only was I dominated by my parents but my older sister was particularly mean to me growing up, and my parents would normally take her side. I basically became the family's whipping boy and never recovered, and I never will. This is no way to raise a confident, put together man. That's how you raise someone who's had stays in mental hospitals and who's seriously considered suicide on multiple occasions.

So that's basically it. There's obviously still a lot I'm leaving out but I feel this kinda gives a good impression of my childhood. I'm obviously quite angry going through thinking about it, but everything I've said is the truth. What do you think?",Who wants to hear about my crappy childhood?,t3_go6wku,0

depression,"I have been bullied my whole life since the age of six. I can never remember at time where I felt normal. I remember teachers never helping me when I was scared of people or my parents never recognizing how depressed I was. I wrote my first suicide letter when I was in the 4th grade. I actually never admitted this before to anyone. I could never make any friends because my peers always rejected me. I was the ugly girl that everyone would avoid and so I became a bookworm. Whenever I read a book, it was my escape. I would feel that the characters were my friends and that I felt like I was a part of something. When I became older, I just gradually became okay with not having friends and indulged myself into my education. I graduated with a biological sciences degree and decided to look for a job. Nothing worked out for me so I had to work 2 jobs to support myself. I barely made 15 dollars an hour with both jobs. I was at a crossroads with my life. One day I was driving home and thought about just driving my car into the railing. I was tired of people telling me I wasn't good enough and started to believe it myself. I went home and didn't sleep for two days. I started thinking what could I do and how could I change my life around. The craziest thing happened and out of nowhere I though about being a professional model. I had offers when I was younger but I thought it was a joke. Who could ever want someone like me in a photograph? I told myself, if I couldn't succeed in this, then I should just end my life. Well, I took all my savings, got my portfolio done and set off to an India to become a model. I had no contacts, no friends and just myself to relay on. No-one ever told me that their was a year deposit in India, so half of my savings went to the deposit for a small 1 BHK.  I could only afford a room, with a small kitchen and a bathroom. I didn't have any shower so I would use a hot coil to heat a bucket of water to bath myself. I couldn't afford cable or a bed, so I slept on the floor. I went to ever agency in India and was rejected in the first month. I didn't know what to do, so I told myself to give a chance of six months to really give it my all. After six months, of being cheated by ""model recruiters"", ""movie producers"" and anyone related to the industry, I was worn out. I started to believe everyone who told me I had no chance, I could never make it. In the days I thought about leaving this world behind, then I got a callback. I had an interview for a major advertising ad in India. It was the first time anyone had called me back for any job interviews. I literally remember trying to pick the right outfit down to the ""natural"" makeup for the interview. After walking into the conference room, I saw this man staring at me from across the table. He was the client and was super intimidating. I remember that he looked at me with such a stern face that I was so scared to even look at him. He didn't ask me any questions but stared at me. I had an interview with the photographer and showed him the only four pictures I had in my portfolio at the time. I remember the interview was ten minutes and I walked away feeling like a failure. That night I wasn't sure what to do with myself, it was the first interview I had coming to India, and nothing worked out from since I started my journey. That night, I received the phone call I got the job. I screamed so loud, I think all of India could hear me. I was so scared for the shoot, I thought I would do bad. After the photoshoot was over, I didn't know what to expect. The next three weeks, I waited to see if I really got the campaign. I went near the showroom, and to my disbelief, I saw a 20 foot billboard of me in front of the store. I couldn't believe my eyes. Not only that, I received over 1000 billboards all over Bangalore. A small town girl, with all doors closed in her face, received the best thing that could ever happen. After that day, I had people non-stop calling my phone for campaigns. I wanted to write this post because I know how cruel life can be. I learned that bullying can leave life-long scars on people who never deserved it. I wanted people out there to know that there is hope....you have to be strong even though you feel that you are the end. Don't give up and always believe. I believe that our minds can sometimes be our worst enemy. We have one life to live and we should be happy and not care what people say about us. Be who you are and never feel that you are not good enough.",To the people who feel that are at the end.......,t3_godnv1,0
depression,"Early of 2018 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and tried to kill myself thinking it was the best way to end my suffering. Looking back now, I still feel sorry for the old me for not being able to think of a better way to fix my issues. 

Few days before **the planned day** of killing myself, I wrote a goodbye letter to my family apologizing for giving up and for causing them a lot of trouble, while I was writing it, I was also giving them ideas and instructions on how I should be dressed during my funeral and how I wanted everyone to at least make it a bit of a happy send off. Was I selfish for asking them that? – Definitely. 

I was thinking that time that if I die I’m giving them a big favor and that If I die every problem I or my family have will disappear.

I felt useless.

I felt like a trash. 

I felt like my father was right, I was nothing.

depression,"Im not trying to be perfect or anything but I make bad mistakes:

- my crush was implying for us to exchange numbers and I just froze up and didn’t. I know she likes me back but now I don’t know when I will see her again because our work schedules changes every week. I still really like her but I didn’t think I’d find a girl I would fall for 3 days into a new job. I wasn’t prepared for this and quite frankly this is on me. I feel really dumb and stupid but I can’t beat myself forever. I am proud of myself for talking to her instead of just mindlessly forgetting about it. 

- I never took treating my mental health with drugs seriously and it has only hurt myself in the long term. I’m a complete mess and living a simple life is immensely stressful. I just avoided the idea of drugs for such a long time and this mindset really hindered myself. I’m planning on getting sleeping meds soon from a online doc, and whenever things start opening up, I will get ADHD meds. I still have to open up to the idea of getting Anxiety meds because I absolutely need it

- I never took the right steps in the last few years and it has showed. I should have gotten a job a million years ago. I should have started treatment for Peyronie’s disease since I was 18. I shouldn’t have been so resistant to going to college. I really fucked myself over.

I am still unemployed and living with my parents. I recently have been looking at my future, which I set very high expectations for due to my parents and myself and its looking quite bleak. I can't settle for any job that isn't at a reputable company, and I feed sad seeing my friends post job updates on linkedin and their high gpas on their grad posts. I was pre med and now my chances are next to zero of going to med school. Everywhere I search on the internet says there's now way I get into grad school and it's not for me. I let myself down apparently there are no second chances when it comes to gpa and mine is all but unrecoverable from. Throwing myself a pity party I guess. My only chance is to do years of work to get maybe get into a mediocre grad program. But I want to aim for the top. I'm confident that I'm more than my gpa, I know I can get good Gre scores recs etc , but gpa is such an important aspect in applications that every good college will overlook me.

depression,"A friendly hello to everyone who is reading this. I am here because I don't know what to do anymore. To understand my problem I am going to tell you my story. (And sorry for any tippos I am not a nativ english speaker)

I am a 20 year old man and I have not been well for quite some time. There have been problems since childhood. My mother and father were both alcoholics. There were many nights when my father would come home completly drunk. He insulted my mother again and again and finally became palpable. I still remember when I stood my ground against my father for the first time when I was 10 years old. I threatened him to leave my mother alone. But it was without avail. Of course this also left scars on my mother. She also picked up the bottle. I often tried to hide it from her but she could just buy a new one. I was a kid. I did not know how to handle that situation. I often cried myself to sleep as stupid as it sounds. I always asked what i did wrong to deserve this. A lot has happened over the years. I lived with my brother and sister some time because they just could not watch anymore. But I was just too young. I just wanted to go home to my room. Luckily for me I was in a boarding school these past years. I was only at home on weekends. It was a wonderfull time. I found friends. I found time for myself. I took all that bullshit from home and forced it in the back of my head. But everything started going downhill completly at new years eve. My mother finally did what had to come. She fought back. Both of them were completly drunk when i left for a party. At 11 pm i got a call from the police. My mother stabbed my father. So..my mother goes into prison and my dad is in hospital. To be honest i hoped my father would die.. but he did not. I lived alone for about a month. My brothers and my sister tried to help me as much as they could. But I could not look them in the eyes. Because I did not really know them. My siblings tried to distance themself from my parents. And i understand that. And over the years my real family were my friends. After the incident i still finshed my school and dispite all the stuff that happened i graduated. 

All these years i shoved all the bad thoughts away. But now they come to haunt me. I thought i had left it behind me.. but now from one second to the other I just want to let go. Let the pain go away. Just putting an end to all this bullshit. But I do not have the guts to do it or i might have already jumped from a bridge. I cant even cry anymore. There is no emotion anymore. I just sit in my room and think. But.. I do not want to die. Life is beautiful. But i do not see the beauty of the world anymore. I do not want to go out.. meet friends.. girls.. i just cant. I dont see the point anymore. There is no goal to reach. No place to call home. The only question thats in my had all day is why I am still doing this. 
And so.. i landed here. I have no one i can talk to. No one i want to talk to. I dont even think that it is a good idea to write all of this.. but it does not matter. All i want is to find someone who understands me. Knows my pain. And can just tell me where to put my feet to take a step in the right direction. Because I just cant see a way. 
So.. if you could help me i would be thankfull from the bottom of my heart.",I am begging for your help,t3_go3opm,0

depression,"Let’s pretend this person is a friend. My friend wanted to live a basic year of working and doing normal things. 

Is it normal my friend has someone asking their friends how to help my depressed friend? 

Is it normal they called the police because this person accidentally said, “why are you prying? do you think I’m going to try to kill myself?”?

My friend wants to believe he will see the pocket knives and fun mostly harmless things that were taken from him again because he was depressed when the police came or is that unreasonable and they’re gone forever? 

Every pair of gym clothes lost their string in them because every call for help from my friends helpers is another suicide watch he didn’t ask for. Is not asking for help really the biggest warning sign my friend doesn’t see? 

All of the potential friends or partners get briefed on my friends depression and all of the psychiatrists involved need to be contacted by these people helping. Is that normal? 

Is being asked on a regular basis “did you take your meds?” normal? 

If my friend was asked to go to a family of depressed people support group to prove they were the depressed person in their life... is that normal? 

Being taken to the hospital again because they stopped taking their meds when the prescription ran out... They had no money and are starting to resent the whole process. The people trying to get a psychiatric crisis team to transport this person to a padded room because it is now an emergency... is this the way getting through depression is supposed to look? 

Nobody cares about where my friend goes during the day or how work was. Nope, if he shows an attitude it is enough to get violent force and dropped off at a rehab for drugs, when this person doesn’t have drug or dependency problems, demanding a suicide prevention hold for my friend. Just curious. 

He never had suicidal thoughts or tendencies, nobody in his family ever did, and really it’s become who he is and how his family and he identifies him. Is this normal and if it is, when does it end?

depression,"As a kid I used to live with my mum and my two half sisters (let’s call them Mia and Aly). My mum was quite depressed after her divorce from my dad so my eldest sister Mia took care of me and my other sister Aly but I was young and didn’t really undertsand or see that but now I realise what it was like. Once Mia turned 18 she went to University and left home so left me and Aly alone with my mum. It started off with Aly and my mum arguing a lot; soon ended up really bad as my mum and Aly used to beat each other up and both were covered in blood and bruises every night (I was about 8 when this was happening) and I used to hide in my room scared. Aly used to completely trash the house and would smash all the windows and mirrors and the whole house was trashed every single day. One night Aly held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me and that has scarred me for life and I ended up blaming Aly for everything that happened at home and didn’t speak to her for a long time. My mum called the police on her and she went to live with her dad (he’s not my dad as we are half sisters). After that things at home were a lot easier so I felt like a weight had been lifted and everything would be normal again. Instead the complete opposite happened. I always visited my dad on weekends but I know my mum didn’t ever really want me to see him so since I was 6 I always knew never to tell her anything about what I did when I went to my dads house eg if he got me a present or took me to the zoo etc bc I knew it upset my mum and she would scream at me and tell me that I was ‘against her’ and wanted to hurt her. I always wanted to see my dad more because when I was at his house I felt safer and I was scared to be at home with my mum and my sister. So one time in summer (before I started secondary school, and after Aly had moved to her own fathers house) I thought as things had calmed down a bit I would ask my mum if I could visit my dad more. When I did she punched me scratched me dragged me around the house by my hair and smashed my head in all the doors in my house I hid and cried and never told anybody about what had happened because I was so scared about what my mum would do. The conversation never came up again but that’s where the abuse started. Already going into secondary school I was very anxious and scared all the time and I struggled to make friends. Long story short I made friends with the wrong people, told them about the abuse I went through with my mum, how she would hurt me physically and tell me I’m worthless and disgusting and that I shoukd kill myself etc I had also started to self harm and restrict my eating and they ended up telling everyone about what I was going through and ended up being bullied. A few years later I had almost reached the end of my tether and was going to kill muself I couldn’t cope with my life anymore and finally had to courage to tell my dad what went on and live with him. Yes the house was calmer, but my dad is an alcoholic and the woman he’s married (this is his 5th) wife hated me and would always moan about how she didn’t want me here and how I’ve ruined everything. At 14 ish I got myself into smoking and drugs and alcohol and I just wanted attention I wanted to feel loved. So I would meet up with guys double my age and they would make me suck them off or do things tk them I wasn’t comfortable with. I hated myself and felt like I need approval from men so would send them pictures of my body. It’s a few years later now, I haven’t self harmed in a year, been on anti depressants for almost 4 years now have a supportive boyfriend and in September I will start University where I’m going to study children’s nursing. Every day I sit in my room and don’t really talk to people I’m the outcast of my family and I just feel like nobody truly cares about me. I try to pretend I’m okay but I don’t feel like I’m living and I’ve tried therapy everything but I don’t feel normal I feel like I’m being punished everyday for being alive and really regret not taking my own life idk.",I don’t feel comfortable in my own life,t3_go4gne,0

depression,"After being alive for 21 years and being miserable for what seems like most of them, I am finally, genuinely curious to know what it's like.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what it's like to just not care about anyone except those close to you — to just not care when someone else around you is struggling or unhappy. I can't seem to even think a coherent thought to myself when that happens. It's always immediately about them. Don't ever want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what it's like to treat words and people like they're disposable, to be able to call other people garbage, trash, punchable, and any other insult in the dictionary. Everyone else does that just fine. I can't even criticize someone in my own head without judging myself first.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what it's like to have someone care about you, be incredibly friendly towards you, only to completely abandon them on a whim. Ignore them when they greet you, give them the silent treatment, and just ghost them completely. Be unapologetically cruel and just be completely okay. You no longer know them.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what it's like to be confident about anything and everything. It feels like everyone always sounds like they have everything figured out about others, yet I'm usually hesitant about assuming something about someone.

&amp;#x200B;

People seem to get love, success, and care like candy. Sometimes, it doesn't seem to matter if they're unapologetically vile towards others, and it doesn't even matter if they wish mass death amongst people in a church. When they suffer, they get emotionally supported immediately after. The groups come to a halt. Everyone becomes involved in an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

When I suffer, a minute passes every time 60 seconds go by.

&amp;#x200B;

Always giving stuff to homeless people for what? Spending $100+ on a motel room for a homeless couple for what? Having a stupid fucking Pikmin tote bag with supplies in it for what?! I wonder what it'd be like if I were homeless. Something tells me no one would even bat an eye. I'm not sure if I'd even have the courage to ask for help. I'd probably just die in silence.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what it's like to have power over people, abuse it, and laugh about it without feeling bad or questioning if you're being fair. I want to know what it's like to not have all of my happy memories be overwritten by my mistakes, failures, and grievances. I want to know what it's like to have someone hold you close and be romantically in love with you.

I want to know what it's like to not be so fucking, bullshitting god damn nice to every fucking person I meet. Just once.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how hard I try, I just can't do it. I can't so much as be angry at someone without immediately feeling bad about it. I can't do any of those things. For once, I want to, but I just can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I've truly never done any of those things for anything... at all. I truly value the reasons behind some of my behaviors. I like being nice. I like supporting other people. I'm just being myself. I don't want rewards or anything like that. Why does that mean I have to receive punishments instead? Can't I just have neither? I'm the definition of some naive chump.

Everyone and everything else lives rent-free in my head except for me, and I've been completely silent about all of my difficulties and perceived slights until today. This is the closest privilege I'll ever get to screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally reached a point where I'm just tired — tired to the point that I, someone who essentially never comments on internet forums and only reads them, makes an account to rant about stuff that doesn't matter. Of course, I even had trouble finding a place to post because it's not productive or topically relevant, but what else is new?

depression,"So for a little bit of backstory I had this surgery in high school to fix a tendon and that was snapping off my knuckles. I had the surgery once, was in a cast for two months, a splint for another month, and a lot of physical therapy. And then it broke again and I had to do the entire process over but this time they took out the affected tendon and laid it across my index, middle, and ring finger. Now they all move together every time I move my fingers. That was nine years ago. But now the same exact injury has happened on the same hand but to three fingers instead of one like last time. It’s my pinky finger, my ring finger, and my index finger. It’s extremely painful and feels the exact same as when I first had the surgery. It also doesn’t help that I can see my tendon snapping off the knuckle. It happens every time I use my hand or write and since it’s my dominant hand I can’t really do anything. The first time I had the surgery I couldn’t write for months and I had a lot of recovery time and there were complications. Complications being that I never fully regained feeling in that part of my hand and the swelling never really went down. There’s also a piece of scar tissue underneath the skin that when you touch it it is the most painful thing in the world. My mobility was also altered. I can’t do as much with my right hand as I can with my left. I can’t move certain fingers individually and if I try it’s very painful. I’m worried that now since basically all my fingers are being affected if I have the surgery which I know that I will have to have it, it will affect my ability to create art and draw. Art is one of the most important things to me and it’s something that I do professionally and I’m really scared of the outcome if I can’t do it anymore.

I’ve struggled with depression and social anxiety for four years (I’m sixteen) I have one friend who I’ve known since I was six years old. Over the years, we’ve drifted apart but stayed friends, at least a little.

Last school year, she was basically the only friend I had in any of my classes. I don’t have many friends because talking to people is so hard for me. At the beginning of the year, she and I were partners for everything. But then she got more popular, she made so many other friends. 

She suddenly became so mean to me. She was nice to my face, but I had heard her talking about me behind my back to her “new friends” more times than I can count. I was too shy to say anything. She made me feel so worthless

Then I got my first boyfriend. We weren’t that serious about each other. We broke up after a couple months. But a few days after our breakup, he texted me and asked if he could have my answers for an assignment. I gave them to him out of fear and social pressure. Then he asked again. I didn’t reply. He kept asking and asking. While this was going on, he didn’t speak one word to me at school, like he was ashamed of me or something.

Im 21 and im a virgin lol, and i had a gf the last 2 months basically started just before quarantine so we havent even been able to see each other which was sooo shit. Just been talking literally non stop everyday like calling for 4-5 hours some days sextin sendin nudes and basically everything u can do other than meet.

But i did (thts a fact) if youre confused already i wont say the rest because its just been very fucked up. This was the first time id loved someobody i know because i wasnt anxious with her but i had mad butteflies. I told her everything.

I dont really know how to explain i just feel uncomfortable. Like they dont know the real me. My dad today starts telling me he'll teach me how to make websites because my auntie who is an artists wants one made to sell her work. But i already know how and run 2 websites. Im pretty sure ive told him to. But no ones listens to me. When i had a breakdown at uni i tried telling them about my depression and they discarded it as just being a bit sad. But im not sad, im depressed as fuck. I never tried seeking help again after that. And i will bever open upto them again. I find it hard to find the right words at the best of time from cognitive dysfunction. But when their response was basically to eat healthy and do more exercise (i used to be a gym rat, im not fat at all, but now its very on and off) i just dont want to open upto them again.

I cant imagine a life of me doing the things i like doing and that make me happy and being with someone i love and also being close to my family. I feel like its one or the other and i find that pretty sad. But thats just how i feel and i dont know what to do about it.

depression,"I’ve struggled with mental illness going on 15 years now. I’ve never had therapy. Every time I’m about to do it I crunch the numbers and back out. Everything I read is that you have to “shop around” for the right therapist. The top docs around me are charging $200+ per hour...most don’t take insurance. So “shopping around” could mean thousands of dollars thrown away. 

 I already struggle with anxiety about money and finances. If I see a doctor once a week, I have to basically she’ll out a second rent payment. 

I’ve called my insurance company to see what they cover out of network...but their answers are always all so vague and unclear. The therapist will tell me on the phone I can “try” to submit manually for reimbursements, but then the insurance companies will never tell me how much they can actually reimburse. Why the fuck can’t I just get a straight answer?

I also have a ton of anxiety about seeing the “in network” providers. I get a feeling that the top doctors don’t take insurance for a reason, and these in network people must be hustling huge volumes of patients through. Are these guys just the bottom of the barrel?

Lots of people say they’ll go on a “tiered system” if you ask. How much am I supposed to even ask for? I make good income but have crazy high debt. Do I have to give these people my entire financial history?

depression,"Hi, so I don't expect any real help, not because I'm arrogant or something it's just that I'm hopeless .. I'm so depressed and sad that I don't think anyone can help me .. I'm writing this while I'm crying I just want to die to make it quick .. I don't really know why exactly I'm writing this but here we go ;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 28, male, I was depressed for a very long time that I don't know what happiness is anymore .. I even think I'm born depressed *(It's actually a real thing)*, sure I do share some happiness quick moments : weither going on vacation or doing stuff I love, like design and drawing but depression makes me forget about every second of happiness I had. I remember looking at some old photos when I was 8 or 10 and saw myself smiling I couldn't believe it, was it really me .. ? I love videogames I'm addicted to it, and honestly I don't know if I really love videos games or is it just because I'm depressed and I needed something to "" breathe "", it could've been drugs or any kind of addiction.. My parents made me believe *(unwillingly, that's what they said at least)*, that I'm addicted to videogames simply because I love them.

My father was the usual hard working stereotype father you see in movies : never at home, get up early no one sees him and come back very late, only time he talks is about work, only interactions I had with him was about work : ""print me this or that"", ""I need an Excel / Word / PDF file "", etc. .. So I never had a father, I always had a boss, a colleague, or something .. I need to mention that he used drinks a lot, goes to bar and sometimes he do a mess when he's at home : trying to beat my mother, saying some non-sense *(I can easily know when he's drunk or not).* 10 min was the time I see him at home over a week or 2, not because he was on a business trip or something but simply because he stays either at his office hard working / drinking or at some bar drinking..

**-&gt;** Why is he like that ? Because his father didn't treat him well, he was born in a poor family and wanted to change that *(he's quite rich, he owns a lot of appartments / villas, knows a lot of ppl like ministers, CEOs, etc. ...)*, now that he's rich every family member keeps calling him and begging him for money : taunt / uncle / sister / cousin : It have been like this for like 15 years .. He's stressed a lot, works by night, weekends, vacation .. There is no difference between monday or sunday, day or night.

My mother, was hard on us, she was always mad because she knew one day or another, the fact that my father was absent will have a huge impact on us *(me, bro and sis),* she always overreact about something and goes crazy mad *(so mad that she have some nerve problems)*.  She was always insulting me and yeling at me because most of the time I play videogames instead of studying (primary, high school, college) : Because of the videogames addiction I had terrible grades, my parents were always called by the school : unconsciously I needed attention, so I was the funny guy, but when I was at college I got hit by the depression even harder I started to understands things and therefore I never opened my mouth at school (college / university), I was just there waiting til it's out to go back at home, not paying attention to anything ..

Anyway, throughout my life I went to see alot of psychologist and all kind of expert, while kids were having fun on weekends, that's where I went .. Needless to say that I had no friends, never had a best friends or a ""gang"", or something like this, I was always the sad kid in his corner alone in a world full of darkness, lies and pain. Depression didn't top, the more I see expert the more I understand my addiction, somethin my parents were always yelling at me for making ME responsible instead of THEM: I always had this sadness in me because I never had a father nor I had a mother that took care emotionnaly *(they did their part on money .. money can't buy happiness right ?).* I got traumatized when I learned the truth about my "" addiction "", part of my depression morphed into a deep anger and even deeper sadness. I forgot to mention that I'm a sensitive guy, the artist / sensitive stereotype guy so everything I ""receive"" as a good or bad is multiplied .. I am broken emotionnaly, always was.

The source of my depression is : that I had no father nor a mother just "" some ppl who bought me food and gave me shelter "". Thing is I can not fully blame them because they also had problems, for instance my father became like this because of his family and my mother became like this because of my father. I also was shocked when I knew that my addiction was just a cause the real source of everything was my "" parents "".  That dosen't mean I forgive them though ... I really hate them, sometimes I think I might grab a knife and just put it in their head .. It's a weird deep complex : blaming someone and but not fully since you're sensitive and know what really happened, it keeps ringing in your brain : who to blame, ok them but look they also had problems, ok but then who did this to me .. ? .. The sadness and depression created a lot of problems :

Lack of social skills (can't have friends) - Overweight (hardly find clothes ..) - Hair Loss (I spend 30 minutes to hide it in the morning) - Itchy skin (I have to scratch because it is so annoying everyday) - Small eyesight lost (I have to wear glasses when using laptop or reading) - 0 motivation - full pessimism - no professional skills - 0 self-trust - everything is hard for me - I can't be in a group of ppl talking because I have nothing to share except pain and sadness *(If I'm forced to I just lie about my life, I'm used to.. so I could live a little) -* When I had less than 18 y/o I had 75% to piss in the bed without noticing, so once again I couldn't sleep at friends or even cousins - I still suck my thumb *(I can hardly sleep without doing it)* \- no self esteem - recently I developped a tinitus *(you keep hearing a noise 24/7, it is driving me insane and once again I can hardly sleep because of this disorder),* I'm probably gona have cancer or some fatal disease because of all this depression, sadness, anxiety and stress I'm justting getting tortured until I die, my body have no immunity : almost everything hurt me .. God I'm so tired to suffer .. I'm probably gona end up blind or some heart disease .. It is slowly coming, i'm burning ..

I can't write all details, I have a lot of problems .. like really a lot .. I think about suicide a lot of time, I wish someone could just pierce my brain with something, or detach my limbs.. especially after this tinitus disorder I'm going insane !!!!!!!!!!!!! God I need either help or a quick death .. I alays thought myself like an animal or just a pure trash, a useless being ..

depression,"How can I describe this? 
A single blurry image stapled to my mind accompanied with a horrible feeling of loss. 
The image won't go away and the feeling is crushing. This image has been on my mind for years now.
I don't know where I saw first but I've never been to a place like that. Everytime I think about it, the feelings appear and it's completely overwhelming. 
The image in question is this:

depression,"Hi i just joined here. It’s about 3am here where i live and as usual, i’m swimming in deep waters. 

I’ve been struggling (sorry if i spelled that wrong) with depression for almost 3 or 4 years (i’m almost 17) and i’ve told my mom three times that i have depression and she still doesn’t believe me. I’ve never hurted myself in visible ways. I hit myself and hurt with words. 

I was on 8th grade when i first got diagnose, i had known for many months already that everything is not alright and i asked a schoolnurse if i could take the test. I got moderate depression (i hope that’s the right word) and i was so reliefed and sad at same time. Rest of the day was like in dreams. I told my friends. I had to go babysitting after school so i hadn’t change to tell my parents before evening. I remember i thought all the time when i was babysitting that how am i gonna tell my parents and how will they react. I got home and i walked to living room. It was quite late, about 10 or 11pm and my parents were waiting me to check i was alright and got home safely. I sit next to my mom, we talk about few things, she asks me how my health check went in school and i said something like ”ooh it went well but there was a little thing” and they were like ”oh what is it” and i just said that i got diagnosed with moderade depression. I remember i cried a lot. I was hoping that they understand. The answer i get was everything else. They said that it was because of the math exam i got 5+ from it. This is good to know: the last thing i cared about was one exam and i was okay as long as i didn’t fail. They said also something like don’t think about it and you’ll make it. Of course i had to go see psycholocist and i went like 5 times, but the psycholocist was so annoying like she was soooooooooo annoying i get pissed just by thinking it. If i told something sad she was like ”oooh that’s so sad” and it was all. It didn’t help at all so i decided to quit. 

I moved away from home and my home town (thank god) because i went school that was 135km away my home and it kinda helped, because i got so much new friends, i got to be who i truly am (i’m transgendered and i came out to my mom at half way through 9th grade. She thinks it’s just a phase) and the school was very good and literially everyone was friends with each other. At beginning of the school year there was again those traditional health checks. When was my turn, i asked if i could take depression test again snd we did it. I got diagnosed with major depression (i hope it’s right word. I’m using google translate) and i just burst into laugh as a self defense. I like very often to things i shouldn’t, i have a very dark humor. Days passed by, i felt like i was healing and all. Usually i was feeling happy at days and when time to go sleep came, i started feeling depressed and i often cried for hours. I also started having anxiety and random panic attacks, i have panic disorder but i never have had panic attacks but now i started getting anxious by just going to store or parties or talking to people. I started becoming paranoid about people finding out my deadname and all. It made everything worst. Then came lockdown. 

Our school have been closed for 2 and half months now and i’ve been at home that whole time. It have made things even worse, i didn’t even know that was possible. I’ve been all the time with my family, without contact with friends. I told my mom again that i have depression and she still thinks that it’s not true. And one day i had to choose a topic for my english essay but i had no idea so i was lying under kitchen table talking with my mom and big sister. My dad walks in kitchen and looks at me and my sister. My sister then goes like ”she’s there because she’s depressed” (yes they don’t use correct pronouns) and i was like ”i’ve been depressed since eight grade” and laugh a little. My dad goes like ”what?” And my mom rolls her eyes and goes like ”that stupid doctor thought she had depression.” I started feeling very bad and i just went to my room and started sobbing. I comforted myself and went back acting like nothing had happened. It’s been like two weeks and ever since that i’ve been thinking just attempting suicide. I haven’t done anything to myself yet but i feel like i need to wake my mom up. I still feel like i don’t want to die but i still want to cut my wrists to prove mom that she’s been wrong this whole time. Am i messed up? I’ve been even dreaming about killing myself and it scares me. 

Tldr: i’m depressed, my mom doesn’t believe me, i want to die but i’m too scared. 

I really don’t know what to do. There will still be like 3 months before i can go back to my school because of we have summer vacation starting soon. I even don’t have summer job because of this pandemic and that means i will be home for the whole summer.

depression,"Years after coming out of a deep depression, certain music triggers me into a downward spiral.

I used to be and still am big on finding amazing, unique music. During 3-4 years of heavy depression I was especially into music and it would make me feel at ease at the time - it helped me cope.
Now whenever I listen to any music  that I listened to back then would bring me to breaking down - the thing is that these songs aren't all sad or soppy. 

I didn't experience a specific traumatic event during this era, it was more of a deep depression that I was in during my last years of high school.

I only truly started recovering from this deep depression a year after I graduated. It's now been four years and I'm very much stable now and my depression is managed.

I really want to listen to the beautiful music I used to listen to, and be able to enjoy it again. I still absolutely LOVE the music, I just can't listen without bawling my eyes out. Am I not over that time in my life? I thought I had moved past it. Perhaps my mind will always associate those songs with the emotions I felt back then.

depression,"My dad, I love the guy so much, more than words could ever explain, but he always and I mean ALWAYS makes me feel worthless and ashamed of who I am.

depression,"It took me a while to admit it but there is something wrong with me. Every time I have a moment of peace, my mind runs back into the past and I can feel such a heavy load pressing down on my chest. 

It’s been now 7 months since I have broken my engagement. When we first broke it off, I was heart broken. I loved her. I wanted to marry her, but I wasn’t ready and I needed time. She didn’t want to wait and it was too late to stop it from happening. After days of arguing, we came to the conclusion that I was to leave and better myself in hopes of coming back as a better person for her. I was a fool. I had false hope that we could of made things work. I’m sure she had hope as well but as soon as I wasn’t around I’m sure it was hard for her to still keep that hope. Nevertheless, we aren’t together anymore. I try to keep my mind busy with family, games, movies, etc... Especially during quarantine. Whenever I am not doing something, I start to play back everything. The last moment I saw my dog, the moment I last saw her. I still love her definitely but she has moved on and it was ultimately my fault that we didn’t work. I sometimes do regret what happened but at the same time, I’ll learn from it to be better. 


I’m trying to give as much detail as I can as well as being vague since she’s also a Reddit user. This has all been driving me crazy these couple of weeks and I have been losing sleep. I finally decided to get some help and hopefully going to start to speaking to a therapist about all this and come out of it a better person. Wish me luck.

depression,"I have a really vivid imagination, which probably doesn't help my anxiety problems, but it has its uses. In one of my earliest meetings with my therapist she taught me about basic breathing exercises and trying to find my 'happy place'. She explained that it would be a place that I associated with happiness or peace, that I could close my eyes and go to whenever I was overly stressed or had suicidal thoughts. I was supposed to isolate small parts of that place and describe them to myself, such as how things feel or smell or sound, grounding myself into that peaceful place. It's supposed to come from somewhere in your past, somewhere you've been, but I couldn't do it. I've never been anywhere that I felt safe or happy, not even as a child (abusive parents are a bitch). 

So I made something up. I pulled on everything I'd ever read, ever watched, ever experienced, and let my happy place form itself.

 I was sitting at the top of a cliff surrounded by tall grass still wet with morning dew, looking out over the sea towards a warm sunrise. Behind me sat a young maple tree, not even as tall as I was, in front of a massive forest. There was a set of stairs leading down to the bottom of the white cliffs where a pier lay, and on the horizon was a silver ship coming my way. I didn't like the stairs, but I couldn't make them go away. I could feel the cool sea breeze and the warm sun on my face. I could hear the waves crashing far below and gulls calling overhead. I started to cry for the first time in years, not a full on ugly cry, just tears flowing down my face. 

As time has gone on my happy place has evolved. The tree behind me grew and grew with time, and the appearance of the land changed with the seasons. Sometimes there were animals, sometimes not. Far in the north I can now see a small village, with dirt roads, round stone houses, and thatched roofs. To the south are rolling hills covered waving grass and weathered standing stones. The steps down the cliff never changes, nor did the pier, but the ship in the distance comes closer and closer. Recently there's a girl next to me with her head on my shoulder. She has my favorite shade of brown hair. No matter how hard I try I can't imagine a face. Never a face. But I can still feel the warmth of a person next to me, the pressure on my shoulder. It almost feels real. 

I find myself imagining my happy place more and more these days as my life falls to pieces around me while I can do nothing but watch. I want to die so that I don't have to suffer anymore, but I know that if I go I will have to leave my happy place forever never to return. I don't want to do that. I want to live for an imaginary piece of happiness more than I want to live for real life. It's pathetic, but it's my only reason to live.

depression,"Hey guys, first time posting here in Reddit. So, nice to meet you all.

I hope y’all don’t mind me venting here, because I genuinely feel like I don’t have any other way or place to properly talk about all the stuff that’s been going on in my head, without receiving a “It gets better” or “it’s not THAT bad” as a response.

(Also, I’m sorry for misspelling anything, I’m not fluent with the English language, haha)

Where do I start, huh. I have been depressed since my teens. You know, self-harming, suicidal thoughts, the classics. Sadly, everything got brushed off as a simple case of “teenage blues” or something like that.

Being honest, I never thought I would reach my adulthood because I would inevitably end my life before my 20’s. 

Alas, I am 23 years old. Yaaay. :|

On November of last year I tried to end my life, overdosing on a bunch of pills, and since I’m an useless piece of shit that can’t even end their life properly, I ended up in a hospital for a few days and then got sent on my merry way, as if nothing happened. Yay. :|

Obviously, the consequences of that stunt were... nothing. No one cared, and everyone shrugged it off as if it were an “accident” (bitch I tried to legit kill myself does that seem like an “accident”?!)

Fast forward, I am still depressed as shit. The only difference is that now I am pumped with pills. One of them I have been taking it before the suicide attempt, and now I’m taking 2 more pills, ever since like... 3 months?

Mind you, I do not expect “magic” to happen, and I am aware that there’s no miracle cure for depression, but man, I sure do wish to have a single day where I don’t side-eye all them pills I have saved up and chug on them like a crunchy cocktail or something.

It’s really rough living like this, I’m sure you guys can agree with this.

I just, man, I wish someone cared. I try to be 100% honest with my feelings, but every single time I open my mouth, I get an immediate “IT’S NOT THAT SERIOUS”, “DON’T BE DRAMATIC”, “THERE’S PEOPLE DYING OUT THERE”, “YOU’RE AN ATTENTION SEEKER”, “GET OVER IT”, “PEOPLE DON’T HAVE FOOD TO EAT”.

I mean, if If were up to me, I’d love to, somehow, help all those people that are sick, starved, and so on, but I am not Superman, or idk, Bill Gates lmao. I cannot do that, I don’t have the power to do so. But I really really really I wish I could cure all illness in the world, but it’s not realistic. At least, not from me, a broke-ass depress bitch, haha.

I just, I wish I was “normal”. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and carry on with my day, without wishing death upon me. I am sick of always feeling sad and anxious. And I can’t snap out of it.

“How about you do something you enjoy?” 
I don’t enjoy anything. I am numb.
Reading? I cant focus on it. 
Drawing? I have no imagination no more. 
Listening to music? It doesn’t phase me. 
Going outside? I am afraid of people looking at my grotesque-self. (Also, quarantine)
Doing exercise? Used to do it for a few years. I hated it with every fiber of my being and it didn’t help my mood at all.

I can’t even dare to speak with my friends, because I feel like an absolute disgustIng looser.
All of them have a vivid social life, nice jobs, a nice flat for themselves, wonderful partners, degrees, etc.

And I’m just a piece of shit that hasn’t made any progress in their life and It’s too embarrassed to speak up to them because they will notice how much of a waste of air I am.

depression,"I've achieved a lot and overcame so many obstacles. I've been suffering from depression, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and dissociation for more than half of my live. I've spent quite some time in psych wards along the way. I never stopped fighting and managed to get a degree. My grades were excellent, all the internships a great success. I loved my work and was really good at it, despite so many mental breakdowns and crisis. Somehow I always managed to overcome even the worst episodes of depression and anxiety. Until 4 years ago.


After yet another traumatic event I couldn't recover anymore. I've been trying. Neither therapy nor the handful of pills I take every day (also for more than half of my life) seem to help anymore. I ran out of strategies, of possibilities, and of hope. In the past 4 years there have been glimmers of hope that kept me alive, that made me think I’m on a good way, but in the end, it never worked out.


Thinking about what I've already achieved an how often I managed to get up again doesn't help, because it will not happen this time. Not after an episode of 4 years. This is not an episode anymore, this is my life. I have to accept that there's no point in fighting anymore, it just doesn't work.


Thinking about all the achievements I made and the good times I had, despite being severely ill, is not encouraging anymore. At this point, it's just crushing, because somewhere on my way I've lost the tools I once had, to fight all this. What's left is permanent sadness, anxiety, pathological sensitivity and hypervigilance. Resilience? Long gone, and nowhere to be found anymore.


I think I could somehow fight depression. But being housebound because of agoraphobia makes it impossible. I'm getting more and more suicidal, and I care less and less about it. Because, what's left to fight for?


I'm a shadow of my former self. I've been afraid of leaving the house for 4 years. I live in isolation, almost no contact to friends or family. I'm embarrassed, I don't want to be a burden, and I can't listen to my friends telling me about their lives, without starting to cry, because I know that I'll never be able to live this kind of life anymore.

depression,"Hello everyone. Long post ahead. If you read this, thank you.

I, (M26) have been in a relationship with my partner (F24) for almost seven years now.

Apart from 4 important exceptions, the relationship has been an absolute dream. We've had a shared, and explicit understanding that we are going to get married and build a life together. We have the same values and perspectives and goals in life, and we share lifestyles and hobbies and friends but we're not so intertwined that we have unhealthy dependence on each other.

We both understand that negotiation and communication is a vital part of any relationship, and we've managed to become very efficient and productive in this regard.

We've grown up in two small towns an hour apart, with strong relationships to our families. We're very close with each others families, and to some extent each others extended family. Our families have also become good friends after all these years.

The whole thing started when my friend and I met her and a couple of her friends on our way to a party. We were seniors in high school at that time, and they were juniors. Incidentally we ended up hanging all night, and my now girlfriend and I crashed at a mutual friends studio apartment that night.

Unexpectedly, we really hit it off on a deep level that first night. She had removed her makeup, which, normally she would be really insecure about, but I complimented her and told her she was really beautiful, in a friendly and non-romantic manner. We spent hours talking about deep things, and we ended up sleeping in the same bed without doing anything at all but spooning, and that was after one of the first conversations we ever had. She later told me she would've lost her respect for me if I had attempted something.

Her and I, in addition to a few others started hanging out regularly, and became one of those group of friends you see on TV shows. We had tons of fun together. We were two girls and three guys. The other girl and one of my friends quickly got together.

Then my now girlfriend, my other friend, and I remained. He and I had both known for some time, that she was interested in him. However, we proceeded to hang out for a while without any developments there.

A few months later all of us were at another party. There was real good chemistry between me and my now girlfriend, and she ended up inviting me to sleep in the same bed as her. I didn't think much of it, we had done it once before without it being something romantic. This time however, the second we hit the bed we kind of simultaneously made a move. We slept together.

I was really excited about this. I had started to develop romantic feelings for her, or I was at least curious about her. I had the impression that this could go somewhere. We were good friends, we really hit it off, and the sex was pretty good, even though we both were pretty inexperienced at the time.

However, the following day we had an awkward morning together, and that evening she called me and told me it was a mistake and that it shouldn't have happened.

I found this really uncomfortable. I felt used, and I felt ashamed that someone would regret sleeping with me. We were only slightly tipsy that night, she invited me to bed, which I never would have done, and she was really excited when we slept together.

Previously I had dated her best friends older sister, (who treated me very poorly) which admittedly made the whole thing feel a lot worse. She felt she had to admit it to her best friend, and she did, throwing me under the bus. So, on many levels I felt ashamed, and also shamed for the whole thing, which I didn't initiate.

We continued our friendship, and after a few months I find out that she has slept with the friend who she was initially interested in. He was a straight up fuckboy, and he had been manipulative with her about the whole thing.

Firstly he lied about how the whole thing happened. He made the move, but told me that she did. He also lied about how it happened, making up a story about how she was kind of teasing him. He admitted to this fabrication way too late. And apparently he told her, while on top of her, that this was to be a secret, a one-time thing, and that it didn't mean anything.

The cherry on top was that he called me to try to convince me that we couldn't be friends with her, and that we should freeze her out.

This incident was the start of the unraveling of my friendship with him. He did this to her, and it was horrible.

But I didn't find her blameless either. She wouldn't tell her best friend that he slept with this guy too, because that would reflect poorly on her this time, rather than on me. So it also hurt that she threw me under bus and used me as scapegoat when it would reflect poorly on me, but when it reflected poorly on her, she wouldn't say anything.

At one point I'm driving her to the pharmacy because she's not on time for her period. She didn't use protection with him, and she thought she might be pregnant. I listened to her, and supported her, even though it hurt me a lot, and it's degrading. (way) Later on, I also have to have a conversation with both of them, because I'm having trouble with my testicles, and my doctor says we all have to get tested for STDS. Even though that's not the issue, it was super degrading.

Under a month later she starts messaging me, telling me that ""she has something to tell me"" and that she wants to meet. I remember reading this at work, and I immediately start suspecting this to be a confession of her feelings towards me. I make her say it in the chat, and sure enough, that's what it is.

I'm baffled by this, and I reject her politely, but the thoughts I'm thinking are much worse than I let on. How could she do this, and what could she possibly hope for, given what's happened?

But, the thought somehow grows on me. Perhaps I'm too easily flattered, but the thought of someone wanting me, combined with being in a tough time in my life, that she's a close friend, and being lonely, I eventually invite her to my house. I invite her, and a few friends over, and she spends the night. Once again we sleep together, and from that moment on we're exclusive.

For about two years, this incredibly messy situation really gets to me. I feel like I was the second option, I have feelings of being cheated on, and betrayed, I feel that I let myself down by being seduced, and that I should have had a much higher standard.

However, our relationship is incredible, passionate, fun, easy as hell, and she's the complete opposite partner to my ex. I was used to being treated poorly and manipulated, and thinking thats the reality of relationships. I now feel wanted, loved, respected, and cared for.

We spend the next four years in a distance relationship. We live an hour apart, and I went away for school for a year, came back, and then she did the same thing. We spent every minute we could together, but it wasn't that often.

We finally move together, after nearly four years of only being together in weekends, holidays, and so on.

The relationship is great, and we've finally moved together, and we've finally started going to university.

My girlfriend has at this point dealt with what we both thought were minor mental health issues. She had a history of self harm prior to us getting together, and during our relationship she experienced bouts of mysterious and overwhelming, but short lived sadness.

Her first year of university wasn't great. Her commute was long and exhausting, and she would be drained and nauseous by the time she came home. Her class was tiny, and she didn't really hit it off with her classmates. They didn't form a strong friendship organically.

There was another group of people she met, who she got along much better with, but for some reason they treated her poorly. She was excluded from a lot of the activities they did together, and they labeled her as this ""good girl"" that ""probably wouldn't be interested in hanging out"" because she was doing all these ""good girl things"". I was so mad at these morons, and I couldn't fathom why they would treat her like this. She's fun, open, excited, and full of joy, and a thousand times more interesting than them.

For the second year of university, we moved to another, much bigger apartment. She was doing her minor this year, which would eventually lead her to meet a lot of great people.

Simultaneously, she was building up to a severe depressive episode, unbeknownst to the both of us.

Christmas break was coming up, and I had been offered a months work back home, so we agreed that I would go home three weeks before her. She was really sad that I was leaving, and she was also really worried about me leaving the relationship during that time, which I consoled her and comforted her about, saying I never would. Everything leading up to this was great. We had a great social gathering, she was really emotional about our relationship, we had tons of really energised and fun sex, everything was going great. We were just as good, and just as in love as we had been since we first got together, and we were about to celebrate five years together.

I go home for Christmas break, and after a week or two, she breaks up with me. When I went home, she discovered that she didn't miss me, couldn't see a future for us anymore, and that she didn't want to be with me anymore.

I was traumatised by this. Not only was it out of nowhere, it was the last thing I was expecting, given how good everything was, and how much she expressed dreams of our future, her emotional love for me, and also being really physical. Not to mention that it had been established for years that we would spend the rest of our lives together.

But I sympathised greatly with her. I wrote her a 10-page declaration of my love, and words of encouragement, thanked her for our relationship and wished her the best of luck. I wrote letters to her family, and went on a farewell visit. It was only intended to be a short visit, but we ended up in her room, and I was consoling her. I knew that it was traumatic for her that her whole world view shifted, and that she had to ""separate the families"", and do this to me, and face the possible judgement of those who knew us. I asked everyone to support her, and I never spoke badly about her, and told everyone that, truthfully, she had been absolutely great to me.

She kept insisting that I did nothing wrong, that I was the perfect boyfriend, and that we were a perfect fit in every regard, it was just that she had lost her feelings for me.

This was the toughest time of my life. We had a 16 hour car, bus, and train ride we had to do together in a few weeks time to get back to the city we went to university in, and I had to get another apartment, and move out before school started again.

So I found myself a shitty place to live. Not even a month passes by, before she texts me to say that she wanted to see me to tell me that she think she knew what happened between us, and that she also ""missed me very much"". She wanted to meet under false pretenses to secretly figure out if she wanted to be with me again. I told her that that made no sense. I am already a fairly neurotic person, and I had been in a circle of deep self loathing and analysing every possible aspect of our dynamic, and I had told her what I thought I did wrong, and what I could improve upon, so there was nothing new to be discussed, and meeting her would likely negatively impact me.

So, she told me the truth, and I went to her for a visit.

She told me about her experience being single, and gave me an update, and she was really upset. I, heartbroken and longing for her, agreed to a ""trial period"". Which I still look back upon as totally irresponsible of her. If you make the choice to break up with someone, and you're thinking of getting back together, you owe it to them to be certain, and not make things worse.

She made things worse. I could not for a moment have predicted how unsympathetic, cold, selfish, and irresponsible she could be. She had never been this way in the past. We had like 3-4 dates, quite romantic ones, over a 6-week period, but in all that space in between, she was horrible. We saw a romantic movie in the cinema, all dressed up, and during a beautiful moment in the film, she looked me deeply in the eyes and kissed me. And was completely detached, unsympathetic, and all the rest of it otherwise, when we communicated with other means.

The apartment we moved out of, was owned by a company that rents out apartments to students, so the cleaning requirements were rigorous. I did that, as a favour, all by myself, so that she could go to this event she wanted to go to. I was going to do it by surprise as a romantic gesture, but due to some circumstances, I had to admit to her that I was planning to do it. She gave me a particularly unconvincing ""dont do that I'll feel so guilty"" routine, before she said ""You could have been a gentleman and just done it by surprise"". I also took the stuff she didn't want to the garbage dump, and drove the stuff that she hadn't brought to her new apartment to her, and carried it where she wanted it. A whole weekends worth of work, and then some.

All of a sudden, I get a shitty text that read: ""ummm, so yea, i can't do this anymore.""

The tone of the text message was completely lacking in self-awareness to her behaviour, her treatment of me, just completely lacking of sympathy or perspective. I bluntly answered ""ok.""

This is during the period running up to my spring finals. I'm obviously shook by this, and I get even further down than I was after the initial break up. This profoundly impacts my ability to function, and I've already been depressed for the duration of this.

It's deeply humiliating when someone who knows you to the core, knows everything about you, after nearly five years of ""the whole package"" rejects you. They REALLY know you, and what you have to offer. I didn't moan, complain, yell, or anything of an unpleasant nature when she broke up with me. I only supported her, realising how hard it had to be for her. But when I got that text, I was enraged for a whole week. I eventually sent her a text where I said I deserved MUCH better. She agreed, apologised, and that was that.

Two months later, I look on my phone, and I see that she's sent me a message. My immediate thoughts are that this is something bothersome relating to our apartment, or any such shared duties.

But no, it's a long text about how stupid she's been, with apologies, and a definitive statement saying she wants to be with me.

I hesitate to say that I've been depressed. But I couldn't sleep, I couldn't get out of bed, I had horrible self esteem, I thought self-deprecating thoughts, my daily functioning was severely impacted, I had anxiety attacks, I felt chest pain, and the rest of it. And it never let go, not for one second during what amounted to a six month period.

Instantly, that cloud of suffering was removed. But I was reserved. I told her that we could meet the following day, and that we needed to have a serious conversation. I didn't sleep that night.

So I meet her, she kisses me, and hugs me, and I have this incredibly strange experience of being back to where we were in the best of times. But I'm traumatised from this experience, that the person that I trusted and loved more than anyone would suddenly turn on our future, on our relationship, and treat me so badly. I talked about how my boundaries had been overstepped, and that I had developed trust issues, and that she would have to be patient with me, and be there for me until I regained my trust and feelings of safety. I told her that I was uncomfortable with getting back together, because I felt that my boundaries didn't matter, and that I didn't want to be the kind of person that anyone could do whatever they wanted with, without there being consequences. But I desperately wanted to.

She got off easy, there wasn't many deep or hard conversations.

Our problems are resolved, it's apparent that she had been depressed, and we talked extensively about her experience as well.

After 1-3 months of being back together, she sits me down to have a conversation with her. She had been having some issues in her intimate area, and she went to the doctor. She has some kind of STD.

I had told her that if she wanted to get back together, she couldn't have been intimate with anyone else, and that was my demand. But, she had been. She told me that she had gotten really drunk, and ""just barely"" had unprotected sex with this guy she didn't even know the name of, for like 5 seconds before she started crying and stopped it.

I do understand her decision not to tell me. We had previously discussed that if one were to cheat ""accidentally"" and regret it, and if it truly was insignificant, the moral thing would probably be to deal with the regret on your own, and keep it a secret.

According to her, it was an analogous situation. She had been really drunk, been really depressed, received attention from this guy and felt flattered, and thought to herself that ""she had to get over me"". And now that we were back together, she told me it ""would be insane to break up, and throw away what we had over this"". Which builds upon my impression that my boundaries are insignificant.

Regardless of the possibly flawed ethics and logic here, she should have made an appointment to the doctor to get checked, and treated before reaching out to me again. Irresponsible, yet again.

Naturally, my heart sinks when I realise what she's saying, and I just go quiet. She's crying and tells me she regrets it, that it meant nothing, that she feels disgusting and so on.

I'm obviously not comfortable with the idea that she's slept with someone and got an STD.

At this point, we've been reunited for a while, and my boundary is not only seemingly insignificant, but actually insignificant. She's crossed it, and I decide not to act upon it. I'm so glad to have my life back, my happiness, my future, and I kind of understand, while being disgusted and angry about the whole thing, what she's gone through.

Another problem is what follows. Almost the first thing she says is after breaking the news is that:

""She can't go around feeling guilty about this"".

There's nothing inherently wrong about this sentiment. If you decide to forgive your partner for something, you have chosen not to hold it against them. But of course, transgressions remain with you. If something happens, and you move on, and something happens again, you can't help but to have a mental list of all the transgressions, and the patterns that they may, or may not reveal.

But I found it so inappropriate to say that almost immediately after this confession.

To sympathise with her, I realise that coming clean about doing this, in a period of your life when you don't feel like yourself to such a degree, that you almost feel that you can't be held accountable for it, is really hard.

She was undergoing a major depressive episode, with self harm, and loosing a tonne of weight, and tried to keep herself so busy that she wouldn't feel the pain.

But I feel like I'm being held hostage. I feel like she inflicts me with these things, that I have to keep secret, and I can't talk to anyone about this stuff, because I'm embarrassed by it, and it would also put her in an unfavourable light, which I don't want to do to her. I can't talk about it with her because she feels so guilty and sad about it, so I'm building up resentment and anger for it.

But I am only with her, and took her back, because we have the most wonderful, intimate, larger-than-life relationship, and everything just fits incredibly well. It's so strange. She's an absolutely amazing person, and in nearly 7 years it's been a dream apart from these really, really shitty things. And I've never let her down. I don't pat myself on the back about a lot, but I've been really understanding, loyal, sympathetic, committed, interested in her and her thoughts and aspirations, and all the rest of it. When she has deserved it, and also when she most definitively hasn't. The things that bad, are uncharacteristically bad, which is why I'm inclined to forgive them.

It's now December 2019. We've been reunited for 6 months, and we're about to celebrate the holidays together in our hometowns with our families again. Our families are delighted that we're back together, and her father and I share some really beautiful moments together, and he can't stop expressing how happy he is with us being back together.

Holidays are over, and we return to the city we live, and go to university in.

She's a lot better off now than she was a year ago when she initially broke up. She's got a really good group of friends, she's doing good in school, and she's involved in stuff she's interested in creatively.

She starts playing board games with this group of friends, which lasts for 3-5 hours every time. She also goes to parties and stuff with them in the weekends. She's more with them than she is with me, making dinner with them, watching movies, and all of that stuff. There's this guy in the group who is leaving borderline inappropriate comments on her facebook and instagram, he's posting them together on facebook, they spend a lot of time together, he's telling her how he is ""ready for a relationship again"" but he's ""so insecure"", which seems like an attempt to get compliments or something. He calls her and has loving nicknames for her, which I told her I don't appreciate. It seems like every other time me and my girlfriend is going to bed together, he calls around 10-12 at night.

I'm so happy for her that all of her social issues has been resolved, and that she's really found her place in the city, and the student community. And I'm very afraid of being a manipulative and controlling boyfriend, because I don't believe I'm that kind of person, but I would like to talk about the things that makes me uncomfortable.

That was the situation for a while, and I tell her that ""we have to spend more time together. the only thing we seem to be doing together now is brushing our teeth and going to bed."", to which she agrees.

All of a sudden, things get really bad again. After mentioning a few times that she worries about a relapse to her depressive state, she suddenly tells me that she's depressed. She makes a doctors appointment, and the doctor makes the arrangements such that she gets treatment with a psychologist, and she immediately starts using SSRIs. Normally, they refer you to a psychologist for therapy first, but they concluded that the depression was so severe that she should start taking them immediately.

She told me how frustrating it was to be depressed again, because she was so happy with how her life was, so it wasn't because of her life circumstances that she relapsed.

And on top of it all, the corona-pandemic breaks out. All lectures and aspects of student life is moved online, and all extracurricular activities is canceled for the rest of the semester. She finds this really hard to deal with, understandably.

And since this point in time, we've seen each other maybe 4-5 times. It's been two months. I haven't seen her for a month now, and we exchange texts once a day.

This arrangement is agreed upon. She told me ""she needed a break, and figure out what she wanted"" regarding our relationship, which is so lacking in awareness that it's almost comical. She has spent the last year consoling me, written me letters saying in the strongest possible terms that she will never take us for granted, and never let me go, and all of that.

Now, I know that this might come off as unsympathetic. I don't know how it is to be severely depressed, and I don't in any way brush it off as insignificant. I've read all the relevant Reddit threads about the experiences of depressed people, what they need, when to give space and when to push, how to be helpful, what to say and not to say, and so on. She won't talk to me, so what I've learned as an interested and humble layman is the only thing I have to rely on. I have tried to figure out how to navigate the relationship dynamics when ones SO is depressed. I know that depression alters your brain, changes your feelings towards and ability to maintain your relationships, and that it's unimaginably painful.

And I love her endlessly. I won't give up until she forces me to. I desperately want to do the right thing, even if that means caring intensely for her, or backing off completely, and the last thing is definitively the hardest one for me. I do believe in ""in good times and bad times"" and ""in sickness and in health"". But I can't help feeling that I have to stand up for myself in some way.

I tried to say in the least intrusive, judgemental, and condescending way possible that ""It's perfectly logical that if your last, less severe depression made you break up with me, and do all the things that since has made you struggle with your conscience, that when you get more severely depressed, you'll have that same reaction. Please try to remember that, even though you can't feel that right now. It'll make everything so much easier and better in the end"". She didn't respond properly, and instead of taking a full on break, I negotiated that we would text a ""good night-and-status-report-text"" before bed every day. I have endless amounts of love for her, but my boundaries matter. I shouldn't be denied to speak out, to process, and work through the stuff she's put me through.

Suddenly, the ice is thin below my feet again. Suddenly her extremely strong commitments and every promise, principle, and love is gone.

depression,"Hey guys, I really have no idea where to go to get advice on what to do so I figured this would be a decent place to start. My friend who suffers from depression and anxiety has been struggling because of the COVID-19 work from home situation. I think she misses all of the social interactions and is all alone in her apartment with family elsewhere and no friends she can physically visit. We are both graduate students.

I last texted with her on May 4 and everything seemed normal. She was a little bit negative about herself but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Since then, I have texted her multiple times on her phone, Facebook, Whatsapp, etc. as well as called her every week for a few times. I did this way more over the past week because I am starting to feel concerned. She is not the type of person who would become completely responsive to me or a few others I have more recently asked to help (they have been calling, texting, messaging too). 

I don't want to think the worst but at this point I just am. My messages are all getting delivered but I don't have the read receipt. Her Facebook has stopped being active (she's normally quite active here) and no read receipt there either (same with Whatsapp). Calls ring but go to Voicemail every time (same number of rings so I know it's not like she's dropping my call). I even tried \*69 but same result. At this point, I'm worried that something bad has happened since all of her friends in the program haven't spoken to her. Would it make sense to start talking to program administrators to see if they heard from her and then to family members/her boyfriend via Facebook? I hope it wouldn't seem like a weird thing to do but better safe than sorry I think. What would you do if you were me? I'm also praying that I'm not raising the alarms too late :(

depression,"I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years, living together for 2.  We're both 31, and she's my first serious relationship.

Our relationship has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Long story short, she's in the US on a work visa. When we first met, we had some pretty difficult clashes of personality and compatibility. She definitely fell harder for me than I did for her (and knew it). But we stuck with each other, and our connection grew.

I suffer from multiple co-morbid mental health issues. Chronic depression since I was a teenager. ADHD. Anxiety. Issues with compulsive behavior. Recently also diagnosed with Low Testosterone. I've even suspected I'm probably somewhere on the high functioning end of the spectrum.

I've never been to therapy for these issues (I tried to start multiple times, but the process of finding one and then figuring out insurance and how to cover cost became too overwhelming). I have been medicated on several occasions by doctors, both for ADHD and Depression. However all of my experiences with meds were temporary relief followed by side effects that became worse than the issues over time. So currently on nothing.

I told my gf about all of my issues pretty early on in the relationship. I even considered calling it off until I could get treated for them properly. But she has been pretty supportive the entire time. She's shown a genuine interest in learning about mental illness and how she can help me cope with it. For the most part she puts up with my many idiosyncrasies.

Problem we're facing right now is that she's lost her job due to Coronavirus, and subequently her VISA sponsorship. So the most she's legally allowed to stay in the country is another 6 months...but she wouldn't be legally allowed to earn any money during that time (she's not even allowed to get a part time job). Which means she's just draining her savings the longer she stays.

We've discussed marriage before, and neither of us were in a huge rush. But with this new development, she's given me an ultimatum. Either I marry her in the next couple months (which would give her ability to stay here legally), or she has to go home.

I'm so torn I have no idea what to do. I feel like this decision is impossible to make right now. How can I make a lifelong commitment to someone when I don't even truly feel happy? Or without knowing what I feel when I'm emotionally healthy?

Since I met her, I honestly can't say I've been ""happy"". However I've found myself in a place of emotional ""levelness"" for the first time in my lfie. I don't feel the same sort of crazy swings as I have most of my life. But over the last couple years, a lot of times...it honestly kind of just feels like ""blah"". I don't really feel motivated for much of anything. I think may be one of the things driving me forward day to day before I met her was the prospect of finding a girlfriend. Now that I have one, I feel like a lot of that motivation is gone.

I've found myself ruminating on it every day for probably the last 2 years. One minute I'll be convinced I should go for it, the next I'm sure we should break up. Its driving me crazy.

On one hand I feel ""She supports me and my goal...she puts up with my shit...she's a good person...she has a good career..., etc"". We are on the same page about most issues, including our desire to travel, similar tastes, and no rush to have kids. On the other hand, I feel like I should be insanely excited about the prospect of marrying someone...which I'm not. I don't feel ""butterflies"" or an overwhelming feeling of love (I'm not sure I'm even capable of feeling those things).  Which makes me think it wouldn't be fair to her to propose.

Putting a deadline on it only makes my anxiety and indecisiveness about it worse.

I've been pretty open and honest with her about these concerns. She sort of understands...but she really doesn't have any choice but to leave if we don't get hitched.

I feel like I'm not ready to get married. Not in the next couple months. But I'm also not ready to break up?

I know none of this is fair to her. And I feel like the world's biggest POS

depression,"Context: 

My parents weren't great, my mom even admits that. My father was barely there and then he was there even less. He hit me occasionally when he was there, so did my mom early on. She and I moved away but she made me see him every holidays. Basically he was absent and emotionally abusive (also physically but not nearly as much as other people) and she was smothering and absent at the same time if that makes sense. I had to attend all these music lessons, bands, youth groups, etc, none of which I wanted. All of the stuff I liked was bad in her opinion (technology = bad) and she tried to limit it as much as possible. But at least she raised me. They were basically always fighting when they were together.

Problem: 

Even very early on I had no positive emotions for my parents (as far as I remember which is very little). Mostly disgust for my mom and hatred for my father. She was very messy, poor hygiene, eating her boogers, farting whenever, etc. He was always belittling me or saying how I was a disappointment. 

I don't really have any context since I don't really interact with people, let alone talk with them about deep problem stuff but I watch a lot of TV shows and there it always seems like people like their parents. Even the ones that had much worse stuff in their childhood and want to hate their parents always have this underlying wish to be with their parents or still help them even though they despise them otherwise. I don't have that. I could not care less if my father lives or dies and even though I would like to like my mother for what she has done for me and for her trying to connect with me now, I just don't. I don't like her, I still only feel disgust when she hugs me. 

I just can't help to think that something's wrong with me, I feel like such a freak. All of the statements about my feelings are mostly guesses btw, I am not at all in touch with my emotions. I have two ways of dealing with them: suppression and distraction.

I'm not going to sit here and describe how I feel because that's pretty unrealistic but as a guy it's hard to tell anyone that that's what you believe it is due to this stigma around how society perceives ""depression""

The problem is that it's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation with regards to getting help. If you ask for help, people tell you ""get over it"" or something like, ""There are people who have it harder than you, you don't have the right to complain"". But then when it's finally obvious enough how much damage it's doing to you, they ask you why you didn't ask for help as if you didn't...

People seem to act like you're not allowed to be depressed and if you are, you don't deserve help because it's your fault for feeling bad...as if any of us actively choose to be depressed. NO ONE CHOOSES to be depressed and until you experience it yourself, it's hard to understand, but I feel like if someone asks for help or is expressing the need for help, you should embrace them and allow them explain their situation, not brush them off.

It's especially difficult to ask for help right now since even more people are in this position and now more than ever do people seeking help hear the phrase, ""we're ALL DEALING SoMeThInG right now...get over it."" from almost everyone around them.

All of that was manageable up until last summer...something happened where I was placed in one of the most stressful situations anyone can be put under.  Ever since, I’ve felt this tightness in my when I breathed...something was off.

I went to my doctor and he said it was “respirational anxiety”...and prescribed tryptizol.

I stopped taking it...and since then I still can’t feel a thing. No joy, no sadness, nothing.

depression,"Hi there

I'm in a weird situation right now because of covid-19 and I'm slipping back into depression. About 3 years ago I left high school because I developed a neurological disorder and had very bad anxiety, especially as I was in a boarding school. It was super frustrating as my friends just slipped through my fingers and I've had no social life for that whole time. No friends and no one to talk to except for my parents (with whom I have confusing and stressful relationships). I slipped into a deep depression that only in the last year I have started to feel a bit better. I  still suffer from my neurological disorder but I have learned how to deal with its various annoyances in daily life. Before I couldn't see any future for myself, I was a deadbeat high school dropout who was depressed and having daily panic attacks for sometime. Then a few months ago I decided something needed to change, I applied to go back to high school (in a different country) so that I could go to university as I dream of being an astronomer and a physicist. 

It really felt like things were changing for me, I was excited to study, to meet new friends and immerse myself in a country that I would like to go to university in and live in eventually. It felt like I had found my heading so to speak. I think it just makes sense for me to go, my relationships with my parents could use some space. I want to become more independent and not let my disorder beat me in life. But now it seems unlikely that I can go because of the coronavirus, I had applied to go into grade 12 to get my high school diploma so that I can go to university. I'm still hoping to go, but I know in my heart it's not going to happen. The thought of finishing school in my country makes me feel horribly depressed, I'm not even sure if I can enter the final grade here because I left school halfway through 11th grade. I hope that I can go to uni next year, I hope that I can make some friends, but at the moment I'm just slipping back into my depression.

depression,"im so tired and frustrated. 
ive gotten better about my depression and anxiety lately but its still there and it just seems like a never ending struggle.
almost 2 years ago, i attempted suicide and landed in the ICU for a few days having nonstop seizures. but ofc, here i am alive. which, im happy about. i have attempted many more times but it never did much but make me feel bad and worse in the end. i have stopped in the past year and ive also gotten better at not harming myself.
and recently ive come to the terms that im trans, and since then ive been struggling with more dysphoria and just,, being trans.
but whats really bugging me right now,
i suck. at communication.
i always have.
ive had a bf for about 6 years, i love him to death.
though, all these years ive struggled immensely communicating my wants, needs, and what upsets me.
and its not like i dont want too, but whenever i try- i just cant. like my body cant.
whenever im upset, i just get nonverbal and the  i cant communicate. or if i want to bring something up, it makes me anxious and then i get nonverbal again.
ive tried writing my feelings and communicate through typing and showing my bf a note or something, but it frustrates me more that i cant just,, say it.
and even writing it in a note is hard but its easier.
but now, lately, ive been trying to work on communicating all these years and sometimes i make progress and then sometimes im completey back st square one and i hate it.
i feel so fucking bad for my bf (and others) who has to deal with this. i feel so stuck and frustrated bc im not getting my wants or needs and feelings out and i have no one to blame but my own. 
like how can i live like this for the rest of my life?
never communicating, being nonverbal, having issues getting my point across.
if i try to communicate, i am filled with severe anxiety and will freeze up for literally over and hour while my bf i can tell gets frustrated. (which when i tell hes frustrated it makes me worse for me and way way harder to tell him.)since, he tries to help and i just sit there telling him nothing.
and he struggles with depression and anxiety too so he always feels like hes done something wrong and etc and it doesnt help any of us.
i hate it.
i dont know
even this morning i got upset due to being dysphoric about myself, and even tho my bf knows im trans and etc, i couldnt even bring myself to tell him why i was upset. all i had to say was im feeling dysphoric. its so simple. and i couldnt fucking do it no matter how hard i tried and want too. it sucks.
if anyone has any tips, id rlly appreciate them
but i honestly feel at my ropes end because i cant say what i want too ever and i feels trapped and unhappy.

depression,"When I was in college I went to one therapy session with the onsite counselors. I never ended up going bc of conflicting schedule and bc i still didn’t feel comfortable enough where i felt like i could tell that person everything so I felt like it was pointless. However in this meeting I was able to talk to her about how I felt and some of the symptoms I had. I would have periods were I would be extremely sad for no reason (which would range from 2-7 days)and be total fine the next day like nothing happened. She said it sounded like I had PMDD. I let her know that I didn’t want to take pills because I didn’t want to have to rely on them and because I was scared of the side affects. 

This feeling of being depressed comes and goes. Sometimes it doesn’t happen at all and sometimes it last for a week or two. I tried finding alternative things to do like occupying or distracting myself, not letting myself acknowledge those feelings, smoking, essential oils, praying, emotionally eating, talking to friends or family members, but I still haven’t been able to find something that truly works. Sometimes I don’t know if its actually my depression or I’m just upset about something else. Its all been confusing and sometimes lonely and overwhelming. Ive never really thought about killing myself but in this last year the idea has felt more real. Ive kept it a secret for a while bc I just didn’t want to give it any power but I’ve finally admitted it to my siblings and boyfriend. 

Ive never really had to struggle though life, for the most part everything has been easy I’ve had a good life. I think the worst thing I struggled with was being shy. But I’ve worked on that and tried to find things that worked with me. So it confuses me on how i could be depressed and find so much comfort in being sad.

depression,"Every single day, I have the same depressing thought. I feel like I don't really have a set friendship group to call my 'own' and when I speak to my friends, it pops into my head all the time or it just creeps in randomly.  This is every. single. day. Some days its manageable, and sometimes, it really hurts :(

I do speak to my friends mostly every day. But, from 'past experiences' and just looking at them now, they have their own friends to call their group. I can't help but feel left out. I get invited to a party or an event, but everyone kind of mingles with their 'group within a group'. And then there's me, who just awkwardly shuffles in with a random select group. And I feel awkward, and then I feel myself heat up. I'm 'close' with a few people but I feel like they have their own little group dynamic and I'm just not part of it. When they tell me, they 'love me' or we're 'best mates', I feel like it is more done out of courtesy or pity. I don't know tbh. 

I felt like I'm losing my best friend too. Ever since I left for uni, it doesn't feel the same. I feel like we're a lot less closer and its only progressing that way even further. We used to speak loads everyday but conversations now (we do still speak everyday) have become a bit less than what it was and I don't know, I feel like sometimes the messages he sends back come across as 'snarky' or 'blunt'.

I started university this year, and at the start I felt like I had a solid group but two of them are now in a relationship, and another one is too, and another has his own group too outside of it. A lot of the time, they just do their own thing with their SO or group. Then, there's just me :/

I don't think this is depression, because I'm contempt with this thought sometimes and 'it is what is' but it takes one post on social media and then I get really sad. Or, it just becomes unbearable randomly and I stay up all night thinking about it. I just want to be alone for a long time, but its incredibly difficult to now that I am back at home (thanks corona). My family are very intrusive and the concept of personal space is limited at home. I just want to be sad for a while but I can't. 

TL:DR - Don't feel secure in any of my friendship groups. Have had this thought (for ages too) everyday and I don't know whether this is normal and a part of life or I'm being dramatic and insecure.",Is this depression? Anxiety? Or me just being really insecure?,t3_go7fca,0

I decided that every time I felt happy, I'd note down what made me happy. By the end of the first couple weeks, I'd used up all of my post-it notes and I was super proud of myself. I was feeling actually *happy*.

I've not gotten any more post-its since, and I've fallen quite heavily back into self hatred and shit. But I keep the post-it notes up there. I've had the urge to rip them down, just like in the movie, but I don't. I stop myself and I just read them. It makes me happier.

I finally knocked up the bottle to go see a Doctor on Monday. I spoke about my feelings (how I had no interest or motivation in doing anything) and small thoughts of harming myself. I was prescribed antidepressants and told I should contact talking therapies, who recommended depression counselling.

I've been feeling down for quite a while now, but since this lockdown started it's been so much worse. I have hardly been eating - not because I don't want to, but I feel physically sick most of the time and have no interest in eating. I spend most days lying in bed, just frozen doing nothing. I usually go to sleep at 5-6am and wake up in the afternoon. I drink excessive amounts of alcohol almost every night, it helps me feel better and sleep better. I haven't spoken to anyone any friends about this, mainly because a) I don't know how to start the conversation and b) I don't think any of them would be interested or know what to say - I've always been a 'keep myself to myself' kind of guy. I don't talk to my parents or siblings at home - no specific reason why just don't really get on with them or have any interest in talking to them. I use to like travelling as a way to keep myself going but obviously that's not something I can do right now.

depression,"As much as I hate feeling suicidal, worthless, hopeless, sad and just generally shitty on a constant basis, the one symptom I hate the most is the fucking anhedonia.

I was good at it and I loved doing it, and now anytime I try to go back to it, it’s like trying to climb Mount Everest. It’s just not fun at all anymore and feels like nothing but work. This is what I wanted to do for a career, what I’ve been told by many people before in my life that I have a natural gift for and that I should pursue, what I’ve done for most of my life now, and yet I simply can’t do it anymore.

This was the only thing I had left that made me feel like my life had some kind of a purpose, the only thing I was really good at, and now it’s gone, just like everything else I used to love doing. The thing that feels the worst though is that I was so sure this would never leave me and that even if everything else faded away, I could at least have just this one thing to fall back on that would always be there for me, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Every hobby I once had is now long gone, slowly corroded and stolen away from me by this fucking disease that has only gotten worse over time until they’re all now nothing more than distant memories of the past.

Taking classes for anything, even non-credit ones just for fun, always make me feel like I’m back in school, which I loathed going to and had a horrible experience with.

Things really seemed like they were getting better for me for once, like I was finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in my entire life and was about to truly feel happy, but as always, it was nothing more than a mere fantasy and I’m back to being severely depressed as I have been for as long as I can remember being.

I performed at a C average level in history, my best performed subject. Never in my life I acted like this before. I mentioned these feelings to my guidance counselor and she said that I might be depressed. She called my mom and oh dear god.

depression,"TRIGGER WARNING

Obligatory this is a throwaway account but regardless here we go. There are quite a lot of moving parts to this story and I'm in the middle of an existential crisis so this is going to be a long one.

So I (18m) have dealt with depression and anxiety for a few years now. I've seen my fair share of clinical therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists. One of these psychiatrists had a ""different"" approach to things and rather than hear me talk about my own problems, decided it was fit to put a 14 year old on Prozac. Flash forward to 4 years later, I was still on it and felt better but still felt depressed. Depressed about the fact that I had to depend on a pill to feel ""happy."" I know that's not necessarily how pills and medication works but it's how I think of it. 

Anyways, I recently quit my medication without consulting my doctor (smart decision I know). At the same time, I also experienced symptoms of Covid-19 (wow). And I quit a nicotine addiction after 2 years of smoking cigarettes and vaping (f\*cking genius). 

I've felt great since then. My body feels better, my mind is at peace. But, recently in the past 3-4 days, I started to get depressed again. I noticed it through my irregular sleep schedule, not eating anything for 2 days at a time, and general lack of motivation to do anything. I know the signs and I read them like a damn book. 

I traced the reasoning back to something that happened almost a year ago now. I was a victim of sexual assault. I have told very few people about it, my dad included, but I still feel uncomfortable with certain topics. For example, talking with a woman alone in a room, being in a room that was similar to hers, smelling the same things I had experienced that day. All common signs of PTSD I know. 

Well, my parents want me to see a therapist we see for family counseling. However, I don't feel comfortable talking with her about something like this. One being, my whole family knows her, and having to talk about something like a sexual assault isn't something I want to do. Second, I don't know if I can talk to a woman about what happened without feeling triggered by something. Furthermore, I can't talk to a man because it just emasculates me to think that I was ""raped"" or ""assaulted."" (that stems from the constant cognitive dissonance of societal norms and how I feel inside).

So I'm writing this asking for help. How can I talk to my parents about this? I'm proud to say that my dad and I are closer than most parents and children. I would call him my best friend really. I share just about everything with him, sometimes more than I should. But this, I specifically don't know how my mom would react. I never told her because I don't want to upset her or to cause her any form of stress. Also, in terms of medication I've been off of my dosage of 20mg of prozac for about 2 months now and this is the first time I've been experienced a more severe episode of depression and anxiety.

depression,"My life sucks, I mean it really fucking sucks.
I had a good fun childhood till age 12 when I moved from Sweden to Spain because my parents had found I good opportunity in the public agent business.
It was really hard to leave all my friends but I figured I’d make new better friends in my new country. Wrong.
My parents set me up to online school which I failed (no surprise as I’m not motivated in doing schoolwork anyway) , so then I tried a spanish school.
I had a hard time making any friends what so ever since I barely knew the language and not knowing the language I failed on multiple subjects which lead to me leaving the school and retrying the online school I was originally meant to be doing. This is just in 7th grade btw.
Skip forward to the start off the summer and I went back to Sweden over the summer.
My friends changed a lot and had already hit puberty (which I hadn’t) and that made me feel left out but that wasn’t such a big deal. The problem with being back in Sweden is that we sold our house that was the literal center of where all my friends lived and we bought this tiny little house 2 hours away so that took away a lot of quality time with my friends.
Skip forward end of summer and I’m starting 8th grade.
Me and my brother was isolated all day because of out online school and our self esteem and confidence shrunk lower day by day and soon enough we basically had lost our personality.
Next summer I thought was gonna be better than last one bur of course my world don’t work like that.
Me and my friends never had anything to talk about and I had to make up ridiculous stories just to get out of the awkward silence zone.
Believe it or not I never felt unhappy or depressed through out these 2 years of shitness but all of that would change when I started 9th grade.
As usual it was just work work work until you got done and then watch tv or something.
I finished all of my assignments really early so I went to Sweden earlier than usual to meet my friends and try to build a stronger bond with them like it used to be.
But my friends had all girlfriends and we had literally nothing to talk about ever so it always had to be me and at least 2 other people so they can have conversations and I could just jump in and say a few lines and laugh at the not so funny jokes they were making and of course me making up fake stories from my imagination to claim myself as “the funny one” in our friend group.
I had some girl-friends who I crushed on but got rejected on all of them every time I asked if they wanted to be more than friends. It was also really hard to ask if someone wanted to hang because I always felt like they don’t actually like me and just thinks I’m annoying when I’m with them and the only true friend I had was this curly headed guy we can call Hugo who I smoked weed with sometimes. Idk, Hugo was just really easy to talk to but one day he got sick, really sick and couldn’t leave his house for months which made me stay up and nights just thinking of bad thoughts because without Hugo, I’m nothing. And without Hugo I’m just realizing how fucking boring my real childhood life had been.
I have no personality, no humor, I lie, no friends, no confidence and I probably suffer from anxiety and depression too.

depression,"Yes, I know, I just posted something regarding how I really want to die but I just thought that if I told my parents about what's happening this whole situation would take a better turn.

I was pretty active before quarantine, never really been athletic but I got into lifting a year ago and I loved it. 

Since I’ve been home, I truly haven’t had any motivation to move around besides maybe a walk once a day if that. And I fall into this cycle of come on, everyone else can do it why can’t you?

depression,"When i was in 6th grade ( 11 years old ) i used to get very frequent and very severe headaches. My mom is the same way, i think it just runs in the family. I would come home from school every day with a throbbing headache - i don’t know if it was the bright lights at school or maybe it was something to do with hormones, but it seemed to happen every single day. The medicine i used to take, and still take to this day, was Excedrine - which is a painkiller specifically for headaches. I took two of these pills every single day and after i while i noticed i began to feel kind of dull and less energetic. i’d like to say it stopped there but it got even worse. After several months i became what most people would classify as depressed - no energy, nothing made me happy, i felt sad and alone, etc. But, it still got worse from there. The Excedrine eventually made me suicidal. Kinda scary to think about even to this day. I remember at one point thinking “i just wish i was dead” and “i wanna die” and things like that. I even attempted to take my own life several times, thankfully i wasn’t able to go through with it. Once the school year ended and i no longer had to go to school, the headaches stopped and the depression/ suicidal thoughts caused by the medicine subsided. Looking back on it now, i didn’t really understand what was happening with me, as i was only 11. But i’m thankful every day that i made it thru all of that okay.

depression,"So, recently, I met a girl online who I was initially not interested in but I have become emotionally invested. Here's the story.

2 weeks ago, I gave her a pick up line and she complimented, we started chatting. So, this is the usual.

After a day, we realised we had a lot in common, our show preferences, our anime, our music taste, our life, basically everything. We briefly brought up meeting after quarantine due to Covid and we were both extremely excited. The sentences were along the meaning of 'where have you been all my life' and 'we should go _____'.

We were opened about our insecurities and thoughts. You know what mine is cause I am here. Hers were mostly anxiety due to academic-induced stress and pressure from others such as parental figures as well as others' impression of her.

Things took a turn a few days ago, she did not reply as usual cause she normally allocates time in her schedule for social media usage. I thought she was stressed out cause she said so before, so i asked about it but she did not reply either. It was until the next day I got more worried and asked whether I said something wrong. 

Now, she has unmatched me and blocked me on social media.

depression,"I had a counseling session today when I talked about a depressive episode I had a few days ago. I've gotten better in recent years, especially after I started going to counseling, but every few weeks I still have a day or two where things get bad. It used to be months and months of spiraling deeper into a hole of wanting to die, now it's just a matter of hours. So progress I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

But I talked to my counselor about having suicidal ideation and minor plans during the episode itself, and of course that leads to the question of how much I tried to instrumentalize stuff. Now I'm always lowkey afraid of getting Baker-Acted so I tried to explain where I was at that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, suicide is like going to Paris. Most people think, ""Man, I'd like to go to Paris,"" at one time or another, but don't really think about it that much. For other people, though, it kind of becomes this fantasy they fall back on, like ""I want so desperately to go to Paris, it would be amazing."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Then you get stuck on it. Your mind always returns to this dream, this persistent need to get there. You research it, learn all the ways of getting to Paris, look at famous people who went there, read stories about Paris. You think your life would be infinitely better if you just went there but it would hurt (your wallet) too much or it would be inconvenient for other people in your life. ""I can't go to Paris. Who would feed my dog?""

&amp;#x200B;

Then you start looking up flights on a whim, pricing airlines or train tickets. What's the easiest way to get to Paris? What's the quickest? Maybe you start doing an inventory of what you'd need to get. It's not serious of course... You're never going to actually pull the trigger are you? You're too cowardly to actually go.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you buy a ticket. You don't care how much it costs. You've got your ticket in your pocket. It's real now. You can still back down of course, but it's all in place. You have your itinerary. You've packed your bags, It's all ready to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you're at the airport, standing in front of the terminal. It's here. You have made it happen. One small step and Paris is a few hours away. If you step onboard, it is no longer in your control. Either the plane will take you to Paris, or something outside will prevent it. Everything inside you is pulling to make the final act.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you're on the plane to Paris. You've surrendered to the engine hurtling you across the Atlantic. Thousands of people take the trip each day and most of them make it to Paris. You have no control in this situation anymore. You're just a passenger.

&amp;#x200B;

Then you're in Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe the plane makes an unscheduled landing. Forces outside your control have derailed your current plans to go to Paris. Or maybe you decide to hijack the plane and land it in some cornfield because you realize going to Paris wouldn't solve your problems or make things better. Or maybe it's just a random fluke of chance completely outside your control. Suddenly all that planning is scuttled and you find yourself in a strange place with no plans and no idea of what to do next. You have to figure out how to get home.

&amp;#x200B;

So I told my counselor that last week I was in more of the idle planning phase. You're looking up ticket prices and remembering that it's too expensive and you have shit to do. Of course, if you don't want to go to Paris, then why should you be researching about it. It's not even your dream anymore. It's just an old coping mechanism about getting away from the pain of home. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I have been close.  I have stood at the terminal, ticket in hand, ready to climb aboard the plane. But I backed away at the last second and let the plane take off without me. I haven't been that close in a while, but those thoughts still follow me around, even if I can keep them away for longer. But I have to believe that someday Paris will just be a place.

depression,"Hey everyone,

Okay this feels strange to me as I never have shared my thoughts so openly on the internet (excuse my English, I am Dutch) but I have been facing a problem for years now. I just feel like it has now got up to a point that I am starting to ask myself: ""What am I feeling?"" This feeling I have been dealing with ever since the days I was dancing professionally (your classic ballet kid) to university, to me getting into relationships. 

It all started with me and my boyfriend getting into an argument that led up to me writing this. We live halfway across the world from each other and this whole situation hasn't made it any easier. All the arguments that we had, I can honestly say, are started by me. He is a good guy and he tries to talk to me and figure things out, but that just makes me feel even worse. Arguing with him, whilst I feel like all he tries to do is understand me. Until I realized, that that is it. I don't feel like he can understand me. We are living our own lives and facing our own struggles. However, every time we argue, up to the point that we literally don't talk to each other for a day (believe me that's something since we call every day. Weird? I don't know. We are just used to that) I just feel good? 

I keep beating up myself that I do not deserve a guy like him at all. And it just makes me feel good whenever I do that? I have experienced many times through the years where I was beating up myself for not deserving a happy ending and I felt totally comfortable with it. Things like having friends that seem to not care about me (imagine days of no conversations with them whatsoever) to having fights in my relationships. From a young age, I was convinced I would live and die alone somewhere far away from all the chaos.  I tried to change that thought by saying yes to more things. And of course it did make me happy however, it would never last.  These negative thoughts would enter my head, and there I was crying in bed and isolating myself from the rest. I made some new friends along the way however, that feeling of not being cared about is still there. 

There have been times that I hurt myself, to the point I wanted to end it all. Yet, I just couldn't pull the trigger. And I am trying my hardest to not get to that point again. I just feel like I am getting closer to it. I hope someone out there can understand this.",What am I feeling?,t3_gnzfzi,0

I am literally a stick, I have a boyish body, no womanly assets. I have a very ugly face. There is asymmetry all over my face. I am just ugly. So, please don't say I'm not.

Anyways, when he was comparing her to me I felt hurt but I felt like I deserved it. I know I look like skin on bones, and the fact that Mia and so many women in comparison are better, made me feel worthless. I just felt ugly, but deserving of the feeling cause it is accurate.

There's a quote from the anime Attack on Titan which I used to preach to people who only saw the negative in life. ""This world is cruel, but it is also very beautiful"".

Today, this quote means nothing to me anymore. The amount of animal abuse in different communities and countries, people constantly attacking each other online with the intent to offend or hurt each other, people being encouraged to kill themselves for having different beliefs/opinions/lifestyles, platforms where people talk about the amount of pain they're dealing with daily, babies being born into awful households; it's becoming too much. 

Then it all boils down to ""what's the point?""

Why are some people born just to die in the most horrible ways imaginable, why are animals tortured, why are people being forced to continue living when they feel nothing but pain and suffering? 

I hate being a part of a world where so many people and living things are hurting or being hurt - constantly. I don't want to be a part of a world where the ""balance"" has to be between ""good and evil"". I want to be part of a world where there's zero tolerance for evil, but right now, that's not the case, and I don't see it changing, ever. It's part of life. 

The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect by Roger Williams is a really good book regarding this topic. Within it, people know no pain, suffering, death, famine, illness, etc. It highlights how absolutely boring life would be without these things, as well as the questionable activities people would engage in, due to being immortal and being able to have whatever they want. I understand that this type of world would be worse than the one we're all living in. I don't want to live in a world filled with sunshine and rainbows, I just want the tolerance for evil to be less. 

I can be the best person I want to be. I can treat my own pets with love and respect, I can work on the ambulance and be there for people during their darkest hours, but it doesn't change anything, it just nips at it.

This world is overwhelmingly filled with hurt. So, I'm wondering. If nothing can change that, then what's the point?

We synched together really good  and started dating and she become my girlfriend. This was happiest times of my life. Until some fuckhead made a facebook profile with my  name and started boast all kind shit public out of loop and basically  told lot of shit to her aswell and acted like it was me. This ruined fucking everything including my relationship and lost my friends, and made me so frustrated and lately we broke up because of this. Many times i was considering suicide or beating the fuck out of that fuck head who ever it was but  truth was i couldn't do shit situation it was totally out of my head and hands. I let it go too deep on me and i developed depression i couldn't go school and started skipping classes i started eat lot less and lost weight, which made me even more uncertain of myself.

We didn't got any information from the police they just said he committed suicide that the cause of deadth thats all. Most of people said there is a potential love failure. Some said he got low grades and some punishment in front of the class which might have caused him to take a decision like this.

depression,"do you ever just.. crave someone? and not in some weird, sexual way, i mean--want someone, just so badly, you want them next to you so you can hold them, kiss them; you just crave their presence next to you? love has always been weird for me, like something i thought i didn't deserve. i thought i'd loved people before, a few people, but some of them were just mere crushes, and one, i didn't really love at all. i was in love with the idea of being in love. 

but then there's just this one person, who walks into your life at the perfect moment. someone that just sweeps you off your feet unexpectedly, who gets you, understands you. they're like----gravity. they're the one who is holding you here. they love you for who you are, not who you pretend to be. you can see the future with them, a beautiful one. one where everything is ok, because you have each other. you can see a future where you have finally let go of everything negative in your life, and you're free.

i always thought love was weird, that the movies portrayed it all wrong, there's no way that's how love looks. but, once i found him, that's the exact opposite of how i feel. love can be extravagant and beautiful, and a whirlwind of emotions. love can be simple, easy, or difficult and tedious. love is deserved by everyone. and i thought for a long time that i would never ever have someone i loved, or someone that loved me back. 

there's no one i've wanted more than him. i've never wanted to hold and be held by someone, kiss or be kissed by someone, just be loved by someone, more than him. i don't know if he's reading this, but thank you. you've made me see that i do deserve love. you've made me see that life is a beautiful thing. i love you. forever and always. and i'll always mean that.",love,t3_gnyqyh,0

depression,"I'm in my 20's. I still work a near minimum wage retail job and live at home since I can't financially support myself, and can't find a better job. I've been at this job for over half a decade now, and am still in a near bottom level position.

Meanwhile, literal teenagers fresh out of high school have been promoted to leadership positions above me left and right. Most of the time all it takes is asking the store manager for a chance to try for a position like that, and they'll let you train for it and see how you do. I've been asking for over a year for a promotion and they still won't give me a chance to even try for the position. Because they're so convinced that I'll do a terrible job that it's not even worth the time to allow me to attempt to try it out.

My store manager has told me to my face in plain english that I piss them off and that they think I'm essentially a failure. On top of that, there are tons of little cliques here at work where multiple groups of people talk and hang out and text and chat on social media and meet up after work to grab food. 
I'm not a part of any of that, literally no one talks to me or tries to include me in things, and if I try to make the first move and set things up with others, I get flaked on and never hear back.

So every day at work, which is the only thing I have going on in my life right now, I spend hours feeling like an unwanted outsider as I'm ignored and treated like I'm invisible while everyone around me talks and has fun with each other. Managers support other people here and pat them on the back for doing a good job, but the only time anyone from the management team speaks to me is to tell me what I'm doing wrong. Then I try to work hard and stay on task, and never get thanked for it, while teenagers who I helped train from their first day here get promoted above me and snap at me to tell me what to do, while I'm told to my face that despite all my years here I'll never be good enough to even be considered for a promotion myself.

There are no meaningful interactions with people. Everybody sucks and I hate everything. I mean what is there to even do? Everything feels so useless because all I can ever think about is “why does this matter?”.

I used to think the reason I wanted to live was for my family, but I just didn’t want this as bad then. Now though, it literally is just my family. I know they would never get over it.

I noticed the chipping occurred while eating a potato chip. 

Now just a couple days ago it apparently chipped slightly again and probably from a potato chip as well. A sharp part of it was rubbing against my cheek again. I went in today they filed it down and this dentist says to get it removed as it could be infected. 

I’ve always been putting this off when they tell me I have to do it of course. Telling my self I won’t have to go through that suffering of getting them out. Now I’m just scared, and more depressed than ever. 

I have EXTREME anxiety about dentists, doctors, surgery you name it. Needles, pain, this and that. I'm absolutely stressed out right now and don't know what to do. I really don't want to remove them obviously. And just last night had a panic attack and the worst I’ve had in years. I had trouble breathing and my arms and hands were tingling. 

I’ve lost my appetite because of all of this and can’t stop thinking about it all. It all feels like a death sentence.

depression,"I have been doing everything lately to try and feel better. And it is somewhat helping. I went to bed last night feeling ok, and I began to have an extremely vivid dream. Although it was still very strange and unrealistic, I still felt immersed because I mean I was asleep. When I woke up originally at like 9 AM or so, this dream was a good dream. I never fully woke up. I wanted to continue the dream, so I never let myself fully regain consciousness. Even though I had overslept already (like 9 or 10 hours) I didn't have any obligations today so I quickly rolled back over and went back to sleep and to my surprise the dream continued as vivid as ever. And it was great at first again. I was so happy. I had friends, I was in some sort of program or class. I kissed an old loved one and it felt so real. And then shit started going wrong. . I can't remember exactly but something kept me from seeing everyone. The program leader/teacher and my mom and some random girls who had been hazing me all let me know I was behind the class, and that all my friends and stuff were gone because they finished. And that it was my fault I wouldn't see them again for a long time. . Dream me absolutely lost it. I was cursing everyone because I didn't know what to do or how to finish and they wouldn't tell me. I was throwing things, my mom was not supporting me, and the girls that were hazing me (somewhat playfully at first) just changed their demeanor to where they were victims. This angered dream me. . The ""teacher"" I guess (who was just an unrecognizable amalgam of every authority figure I have seen I guess) was condescending. There was so much chaos. At one point right before I woke up again (at like fuckin 1 PM) I had told everyone in that small room that they were keeping me from the only things I needed to survive, and I may as well kill myself. They just tried to restrain me instead of helping.. and I woke up with very real emotions and wishing I had just got up the first time. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before I don't think.

depression,"I had 12 weekly therapy sessions last year. I went to them because i've struggled since forever with a variety of issues like a major lack of care for things outside of a typical layabout lifestyle, i.e. Gaming, watching youtube videos, etc. It's like I find myself most days wanting to stay on my computer as much as possible. I also have some anxiety, but this is a less significant issue and only strikes at random times. I learnt only a few things from therapy like using a CBT app, but this doesn't have an overarching effect on my life at all.

The lethargy issue has been amplified since the epidemic began, where i've become very apathetic towards my job, feeling very disinclined to work. The more time passes without working I hate myself for feeling like a lazy degenerate.

The main reason I think I can afford to do this is because I don't have to pay bills currently. I think not having that necessity yet is a big factor which I find myself taking advantage of and feel guilty for it. It makes me think that when I do get my own place, i'll need to be working full-time just like my colleagues do. But when this happens, will I be miserable for having to force myself so constantly?

I am curious though if antidepressants like SSRIs would give me the push I need to just work and make simple things like socialising outside and going to work less repelling to me. I feel like this could resolve some kind of chemical imbalance in my brain or something.

depression,"It happened about four years ago . I heard all this lovely talk about Lasik surgery and how it can cure your vision and you'll never need glasses or contacts, etc.

I lived in a small town with just a couple of eye doctors. I've been seeing the one I'm seeing since I was 13. I tried contacts, but they kept bothering my eyes. Dryness and whatnot. Anyway. I ask my eye doctor about getting Lasik.

He seemed all for it, motivating me and reassuring me, etc. He recommended TLC Lasik to me, in the city. I was so excited. Slightly nervous, but so excited.

The day came. The surgery seemed to go smoothly. My boyfriend (now husband) took me home and I slept for a while.

The burning and itching were pretty intense in the beginning, as to be expected. First day back to work, I accidentally jabbed my eye with my work headset mic piece. Back to the eye doctor. He said nothing was wrong phew.

Some time passes. More eye dryness than expected. I got all sorts of drops recommended by the eye doctor. Lipids. Long lasting. No preservatives. Still dry. He recommends me fish oil. I began taking fish oil.

So many nosebleeds. I was confused at first, not being told about potential consequences of fish oil. I look it up. Not much information about it, but through process of elimination, I conclude that fish oil was causing me nosebleeds. I stopped taking them.

One year later, I got back to doctor. He claims that my vision dropped to -1. I needed glasses again. Only thing Lasik gave me is dry eyes. Feels bad man.

I told him about the fish oil. And the nosebleeds. He said ""Oh I'm surprised you came to that conclusion."" Recommended me Evening Primrose oil. Okay, I guess.

Still depressed. Every time I went to eye doctor up until now he says things like ""Well, you chose Lasik, and now you have to deal with the outcomes."" As I suffer from constant discomfort, burning, and pain. I tried telling my husband. He doesn't seem to listen. ""Do your eyes really bother you *that much?""* No clue what to do. Feels like there is nothing I can do. I waste money now, for the rest of my life, on evening primrose oil pills. I refuse to drop money on eye drops. I drink lots of water.

For recent, actually, within the past year it actually hasn't been that bad. I've gotten into the habit of three primrose oil pills a day, with computer glasses that block uv light wearing during the day. I don't wear my prescription glasses that much. Eye doctor didn't put uv block onto them, said my insurance didn't cover it. I was beginning to feel happy again.

Last night , however, was really hard. Husband turned the fan on in the bedroom. I was very uncomfortable. I was up unable to keep my eyes open without hard blinking constantly. Life is suffering and pain. So now I am depressed. Idk why I felt like sharing this, I just wanted to share to someone.. maybe someone who will listen and care. Not sure.

Thank you all for listening.",Suffering and pain keep coming back. I was doing good for so long too...,t3_gnx9t2,0

Hi!

BACK STORY:

As a 20 years old I started to learn about personal finance and I was at the time in the warehouse doing overtime which paid good money and I saved most of it. Till last year I just got laid off from my work and I had all this money and I was depressed about my dad passing away and just friends talking bad behind me and the girl who I thought I would spend the rest of my life had another guy at the same time. I know these don't sound that crazy problems but to me they were at the moment bigger than life. Last year summer I started spending my savings which I had around 30000 euros at the end of Christmas I had spent all of it and I took a loan 20000 euros before Christmas. First I explained to myself that I was going to use the 20000 for something investments or courses or school. It all went down to drinking and traveling alone. Spending was for me that I use this money before I would commit suicide. I was going through therapy at the moment and it just didn't help or I just didn't put enough work to it. This year January I had zero in savings and I own to the bank the 20000 euros. Doctors and friends wanted me to go to the psych ward because I was suicidal but I didn't have the money to go. Of course they will make you like a payment program that is like 50 euros a month type but I just didn't have money and I was living with moms and I am still living with my mom.

Now it is the corona so its very hard to get a job and I am trying still to get one close to full hours but there are lots of people also trying to get a job. Competition is hard. One thing doesn't help because when I was depressed and I got an interview I didn't go so there are many marks in my name in these temp companies that hire for company that I didn't go to the interview and I deserve it. I tried to get job but depression and being lazy costed me so that is one reason why its very hard to get an interview even at this moment.

Kinda I am looking for advice or someone who has/have the same situation to tell me how did they get out of it. Same time I hope there is someone who learns from this and DON\`T be like me. 23 years old failure living with my mom. I don't have a degree yet or anything special.

depression,"I'm currently on Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine. My doctor specifically prescribed one to help my mood during the day and the latter to help me sleep at night.

Here's my problem: I'm overweight but I've put in a lot of effort to change and replace eating habits. I am sadly not as active as I would ideally be, as my preferred working out method is lifting weights (specifically barbells, not dumbbells), and I don't have an at home gym. I have an exercise bike but I feel like 30m on it hardly burns anything beyond 100-200 calories.

I've removed sugar from my diet, cut down on snacking, but I've seen no improvement on the scale. I've lost more than 10kg before, so I know I'm capable of it.

I am both super stressed atm and on new medication. From a search, mirtazapine is the more likely to be having an interaction with my attempt at weight loss. It's also in my eyes the least necessary, I think.

I know I should speak with my doctor but she always requests to see me in person which I do not want to do in these circumstances. I would just like to know if I can still expect withdrawal symptoms if I quit one antidepressant (Mirtazapine, which I take before bed) but stay on the other (Venlafaxine).",Can you experience withdrawal if you stop one out of 2 antidepressants?,t3_go15a9,0
depression,"I have depression on and off, with better and worse periods. Anyone else realize that the good periods suck?

depression,"Hey.
First post here. I'm fourteen, female, and I live in a foreign country. 
I'm terrified that somebody will find this, but I don't know anymore. I'm desperate for advice.
I moved to a foreign country earlier this year, because I wanted to get away from my mother and stepdad. She wasn't abusing me in that way, but she'd shout at me a lot, and call me names because I didn't like my stepdad (who she'd got engaged to after two months, and seemed to love him more than me) ended up becoming depressed and moved in with my father to get away with it all.
But now my dad is even worse. He hit me in front of family for leaving period blood stains on my bed and not cleaning it (I didn't know how to) And he also beat me for self harm, He doesn't care about my anxiety and says he has it too and I just need to stop. 
But I really can't help it, I want to know what's wrong with me.
My mother once told me to kill myself. It was near Christmas, too. It feels like i'm still waiting for Christmas because I associate it with happiness. She then told the doctor that I was lying about it, she just got so angry with me....

And now I just have nobody. My dad does try, he just has anger issues. But sometimes I wish I could just grow up. I want to be alone, I don't want to live so trapped and restricted with my age. I just want my own house and I could wake up everyday and water the flowers in my house and be happy. 
I'm just crying as I write this. I hate the fact that I've been so fucking failed. 
I only have one real friend. She's in an even worse situation than mine and I don't want to tell her, but it makes me feel so horrible. I feel so invalid when she tells me her own problems, I love her more than anything in the world but it's so much.

I just want to know whats wrong with me. I get these things where if I have to talk to family members I just freeze up. I don't know who I am, and I fucking hate that that's so normalized as 'teenage angst' etc. I go through these little phases where I can't get out of bed and My dad will shout and call me lazy and it hurts so fucking much.

But today, my dad got me these flowers for my bedroom, to just put in the window and look at them. I found out that these flowers are highly poisonous if ingested and I just want to do it. I want to eat them - But I'm also scared to die.
Because I know that I'll be happy someday, yet I don't want to fucking wait. I'd rather be in the afterlife and get it now. I can't fucking wait any longer.
It's taking everything not to grab the flowers and shove them down my throat, but I just want to see if I can get any advice for now.

depression,"Recently I did another psychological testing and it showed mild depression and anhedonia. I did psychological test for depression year ago and anhedonia was there as well. The thing is, I don't have any memories of having fun or just enjoying something. I played an instrument because it interested me not because I enjoyed it. The same goes for my hobby, and this is probably why I stopped doing sports - they weren't fun and I wasn't interested in them. I don't have any enjoyable memories with my parents, nor peers. The only memory that I believe has formed me into somewhat more satisfied adult was a private school I attended. I had fun there and it's the only thing that I can think of that I enjoyed.

I hate to complain, especially because my life could be a lot worse. I hate that I feel depressed when there are so many terrible things going on in the world. I feel guilty and wrong.  I hate myself for being depressed. Everything about it. I hate seeing scars on my skin being reminded of pain and regret. And somehow still wanting to do that to myself. I know it’s wrong.

Things became worse because I woke up shortly after and was still on the phone with her so I explained my situation. Of course she tried her best to make me feel better. She told me “Even if I would have a better time with someone else, I enjoy being with you more than anyone else.” I know she’s trying to help me, but the first part tore me up. It made me realize that i’m way more insecure about being able to pleasure her than I thought I was. Obviously I already knew that of course there’s people out there who can pleasure her better than me - i’m barely legal, and not a pornstar who takes drugs for enhancement...  But for some reason hearing those words from her hurt really really bad. Can anyone give advice on how to cope with this?

Before anyone says as a way of support yes I have tried therapy and it didn't work for me. I have been through a decent amount in my life so far and in 3rd grade after years of moving and moving into my uncles I started realizing a lot more. Through those years I took mental and pychsical abuse, and still have hatred towards past family because of that. I lived in a racist town back then but I never realized and quick backstory in 4th grade my parents split and my dad remarried and my family is now mixed. I never said anything racist I've never said certain words but in that White / Mexican town everyone used to say it and make racial jokes and I knew it was bad I even fought people because of it and I used to be able too. I've suffered a concussion that was pretty bad and suffered migraines for about 2-3 years after that which just recently stopped. After family deaths and being poor barely getting by I was really depressed and found music and wrote music as an escape. I still write and hope to be an artist someday because it's all that matters to me and brings me life.

I know that only I can change myself, that the desire has to *come from within*. The desire is there. So are sealed boxes full of things I used to be passionate about and interested in. Somewhere were tupperwares full of technical capacity I would so eagerly practice. I just have nothing to open them with.

I was never a brilliant person, nor someone who screamed pure dedication. But I sure had a mind to follow up on complicated theories and abstractions. I used to love doing research -- on anything! I would read all day and never get tired. Now I can't even read a paragraph; I can't concentrate on forming a thought for more than 30 seconds.

Now I'm doing a PhD project that I still think is really cool, and I want to be committed. I want to be the one to probe the depths of my little nook of academia and leave no stone unturned. The subject matter combines all my interests and the culmination of what I could once modestly claim as my abilities. I want to be able to handle failed experiments. I know in my mind that most experiments fail, and that a good student is one who overcomes that failure and learns from it. I was all about self-teaching and troubleshooting. But now I just can't handle it. I want nothing more than to be dedicated to my work, and be that good student who can overcome everyday obstacles.

Being around people is more and more inspiring violent thoughts in me. So tedious.

Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me. I have two loving parents and I've never been inappropriately touched or abused or neglected. I don't care much for relationships aside from strong platonic friendships so I haven't experienced any breakups. Money's been tight and I've always been frugal, but I'm not in financial stress at all. I've had more good fortune than bad, and to complain about depression (especially that hasn't officially been diagnosed) feels like a cheat.

depression,"Preface: I spent seven years (2012-2019) in Oklahoma with a chip on my shoulder, angry and depressed through much of it, wishing that I could leave.  I finally get to at the end of 2019, a few months before coronavirus.  As my luck would have it, one of the few circumstances that would have led to me being worse off now than I was before is what has happened.

.........

To myself in May 2019,

Think long and hard about the decisions you are about to make.  The life that you think you want, you will never have.  Decisions you will make to try to obtain that life will destroy you.  

One of your worst fears is about to come true in March 2020.  Prepare yourself.

You can move to the city of your dreams and have the apartment of your dreams, but none of it will matter and it will be the worst time of your life.  Restaurants, bars, arts, culture?  Won’t matter anymore after March 2020.  Friends?  You won’t be able to make them.  You’ll be trapped for two years, alone in your apartment, with nothing but your thoughts and weed.  Think about the worst job you've ever had.  That's what you'll be forced to do again.  After the two years are over, you’ll emerge into a society in ruin.

You still have a chance to stay in Oklahoma.  It’s not the most exciting place in the world.  You have a chip on your shoulder because of the circumstances that led you to move back to Oklahoma. You hate the weather, the tornadoes, and the dominant culture.  Never mind the fact that it’s ugly.  However, you have a man that loves you, friends who support you, and family who do love you even though it’s in their own way.

“Big City Bright Lights” is a façade.   Focus on the relationships in your life because that’s where true happiness comes from. 

Chasing the life you wanted when you were 23 will lead you to ruin.",Letter to myself one year ago,t3_gny4l9,0

I got a job and it’s pretty nice but has some stressors for me as well. My Japanese is pretty good but most employers would rather hire a national Japanese person because they can understand 100% whereas I can understand about 85%. 

I keep calling out of work. Compared to some people here it’s pretty high functioning. Bout once every two weeks. Or I’ll go home early about once a week or once in two weeks. In Japan this is a  huge deal and anyone who doesn’t give 110% to the company is seen as a leech and a problem.

I live with 4 really great friends they are 2 couples   and they are always there for me when times are rough. I have a loving family who live a few states away that are also there for me if I need things. I don't have a car or a job I have been studying business and attempting to start a business. My roommate pays for rent and food and helps me with my business. I have a good life compared to most and I know that it's just the depression controls my life most days. 

I've had 2 girlfriends while living with my friends the first girl was sweet and had her shit together. She was very normal and things were good until I got depressed and panicky. Before I knew it she told me that she wasn't ready to deal with my depression and she hopes I find happiness. I had major night terrors of her saying that then seeing myself looking at me and say that you'll never find it and that I should just kill myself. I had this dream for about a month almost every night and could barely sleep. It took a while to get over that break up because everyday that the depression was bad on random days I would think about how I fucked up. 

The second girlfriend was pretty recent and was everything I could've wanted in a girl. I ended up fucking it up with my depression and nonstop anxiety about making it work. She was going through a lot and I understood that at first but after a while I made things harder for her and was always impatient and trying to rush things. I wanted to experience the world with this girl. But whatever is wrong with me wasn't about time give me something nice I started to turn into someone I didn't want to be. I was sad even on great days. I was always asking for sex just so I could feel better for a little. I talked out how depressed I was and she understood at first but it became to heavy I treated her like shit some days and I was extremely sad some days and I was so irritated with how I was feeling I couldn't just enjoy what I had in front of me instead I was an asshole for no reason. She broke up with me on Valentine's day and she moved out of state to get away. 

I'm terrified to ever date again because I know if I can't stop feeling lonely and depressed when I'm alone I don't want to put that on anyone. I'd rather kill myself then have to make someone deal with my depression. I wake up in a panic every day that fades through the day so I hate mornings. It's a coin toss weather I'll wake up feeling ok feeling decent it feeling like complete shit and be depressed all day thinking about how I ruined things with my ex and how I can never date again .

I constantly feel lonely with people around me but some days I wish I can find a girl that I could hold and call my own but then I shut that down because things always end the same with my depression taking over or me unable to connect with people. I can't get anything done some days with crippling anxiety so I just lay in bed for days without eating. 

I gave up on dating apps because I can't hold a conversation it just makes me feel  more lonely. I feel like it's a lot more genuine and easier to talk to people in real life. I've been inside my house for months straight because coronavirus haven't gotten lit much except for trips to 7/11. 

I'm thinking about getting counseling and meds because it's a better option than just killing myself and making my family sad. So I'm just kinda sitting alone crying for days now sure what to do I just want to live and do things but too poor to do anything and trapped with no car and forever alone. I'm so fucking tired of life.",I'm tired and want to sleep forever,t3_gnsbyd,0
depression,"My boyfriend broke up with me yesterday, my family and I got into a huge fight to the point they don’t even look at me when I turn towards them, and even before those things happened I didn’t have any friends so...I’m REALLY alone.

My ex and my family were really the only people that gave me a reason to get up each day because I absolutely hate myself. I hate the fact that I can’t make friends no matter how hard I try, I hate how I look, how I sound, how stupid I am, etc. and still they were the reason I kept going I hate to admit. I looked forward to seeing them, talking to them, they have no idea how much they made my day when I heard their voices. Sometimes I would even tell them and obviously they would think I was just saying that. But now, I’m thinking everything I did or what I said to them didn’t mean anything. 

I can’t tell you how painful it was to hear what I perceive as carelessness in my ex’s voice and the looks my family gave made me feel what I can’t even put to words...

I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up so I don’t have to deal with all this. I was alone before I met my ex, but at least I had my family. Now I have no one to talk to, no one to give me a hug, talk on the phone, or comfort me. I feel unlovable, unsafe, worthless, ugly, every horrible thing in the book. 

It hurts. 

Even as someone who is alone most of the time, feeling lonely is something I wouldn’t even want my enemy if I had one to ever feel.",I’m alone again...,t3_gntqtt,0
depression,"I wish I could just live where it's just me and nobody else. I wish everybody forgot that I ever existed and I could live in complete isolation forever. No noise, no people, no socialising, no expectations.

Life has been hard. I never say it in person but it has been. My mum died when I was a kid and my stepmom died in the same way two years ago. My dad is abusive and has developed huge mental health issues - we haven't spoken in years. My extended family are also abusive and we don't talk. I have a girlfriend but I find it so hard to connect with people for fear of them dying, it feels like I'm acting in a play rather than living in a relationship. Friends are the same. I feel like they all secretly think I'm just an annoying unfunny person who is a chore to be around. 

Every time I walk away from a social interaction I feel like everything I said was stupid and every joke was horrible. I feel like there is nobody here for me - I can't ask anybody for life advice or what I should do anymore. Everybody is dead or abusive. 


Work is a living hell and lately on my way to work I've started unavoidably imagining driving my car off the road. I feel like a stupid useless outsider to everyone there.

 I wish I could just kill myself but I can't. I want to hide and be alone and just exist without being present. 

So I want to live at the bottom of the ocean.

My cat can be there though - he's alright.",Every day I daydream about living at the bottom of the ocean,t3_gns746,0
depression,"Being a romantic sucks I wish I didn't feel like I need love. I make up so many fantasies it's not even because of the covid thing. It sucks having these strong romantic urges that I can't even begin to know what it's actually like. It's like wanting to die but not because anything else but because the girl you made your self fall in love with ether didn't even like you in the first place which who could blame her who wants to have some random idiot fucking obsess over you and he's a ugly selfish piece of shit. Sorry, or they are to young for you and of course she is the only one who messages you first. Which you are a lonely guy who literally gets 0 attention from girls so when a girl messages you first of course you're gonna be fucking happy. Oh, guess what she's fucking 14 I guess you should have knew that already. so dumb man, Now I'm really trying not to kill myself like there is no way I will find a girl who likes me. This life sucks I know so many people have it worse then me but my one desire and I'll never get to experience it. I feel so stupid writing this crap down but this is what I'm feelin so judge me all you want.",Let me just get it out,t3_gntnt7,0

Yeah. it's one of those nights. There's way too much shit going on in my life and I've been through way too much. I've run away recently, I won't go into too many personal details because I'm closed off. It's a coping mechanism but I was also born a Virgo but feel like a Libra. Don't know if that really matters or not but whatever. I've lived without a lifeline for a long time. I'm not like most people, found a way to survive in the wilderness for what felt like days and only felt like God was guiding me. I feel like John fuckin' Constantine. Near obsessed with the dude anyways, probably because he's too much like me. The only way I could survive was humming hymns, Lil Peep songs and other shit like that. 

Guess I'm a survivor. Police have arrested me, I've been in a holding cell, placed in a mental hospital for a week involuntarily. All I do is clean, go outside to play with my dogs, try to get my baby brother outside more. I haven't had proper therapy in a long time. I talked to my psychologist and he said I was a 'wonderful' but he won't see me for another 4 weeks and through a computer, which I understand. It is what it is. 

I don't use 4chan anymore but I went back on /r9k/ as a joke because I would post my face a lot on there and /b/ as a joke when my schizo first started coming in full force. I also did some other shady shit but I don't need anyone's forgiveness. Anyways, I went back on there not too long ago and said I was a catatonic schizophrenic and that they could ask me anything. Of course I didn't reply to any of them, lol. 

I feel like I'm going somewhere with a girl I've met as a kid in Cali. I don't live in Cali anymore, I was evicted from my apartment in 2016 and had to move across the country to live with my family. Life has been hell and figuring things out ever since. I still haven't finished High School. I'm still trying, passed everything on my GED except for Math. But anyways, about this girl, we recently reconnected and she's beautiful and everything I ever wanted in a girl. I'm just scared of chasing butterflies because I always get hurt. I made my Instagram private and unfollowed a bunch of old friends and even people I didn't know who didn't talk to me or bother to view my content. 

This post has gone on for too long. I'll just drop my Twitter and Instagram, do not find my Facebook and add me, I will not accept it. Do not try to stalk me. I know Reddit is a great community and a safe place but you can never be too safe, especially where I live.

Sorry admins if I broke a rule by posting this stuff.

I know this is pretty personal information but I'm fine with it. Nobody can really hurt me or my family.

depression,"i’m going to start therapy soon online bc my parents found out abt my anxiety and stuff. I went to therapy awhile ago but it didn’t really work and i couldn’t fully open up to my therapist n he cleared me to stop going. I feel bad bc I wasn’t honest then and idk how to be honest now. i’ve always been a screw up and i’ve just felt empty and unmotivated for years now with a few things to keep me going. that changed when I met my girlfriend last summer. when i started talking to her i didn’t rly know if it would go anywhere but now i love her more than i ever thought possible for me. the craziest part is she loves me back just as much. i thought that would be enough but it’s not, for either of us. the other night we had a long talk abt a lot of things. i had kinda known something like this for awhile but she told me that she wants to die all the time, she thinks abt it constantly. she writes a suicide note almost every month, she’s paranoid abt getting murdered or hurt and feels physical pain when other ppl get hurt or sometimes for no reason at all. she’s so sad and I can’t fix it. i just want to be able to take it all for her. I already feel sad and unimportant, I already let the past 4 years just be nothing and have gotten myself stuck in a hole so it wouldn’t be that bad. I think i would give myself up for her and idk if that’s a good or bad thing. somebody has to be a nobody for someone to be a somebody you know. idk i know that’s not possible. she’s getting help and i’m helping her to find someone that can help her not feel like this i just wish there was more I could do. no matter how hard i try making others happy it isn’t going to make me truly happy i think and that kinda sucks. I just wish i wasn’t so useless all the time.",idk what this rly is it’s just some thoughts ig,t3_gntn1b,0
depression,Hi. I have been dealing with depression for most of my life. I have frequent thoughts of suicide. One thing I found that has helped me greatly is knitting. The repetition of the stitches helps keep me grounded. I usually make something for someone else and it makes me happy to do that. A lot of hospitals will take small hats for the preemies. If you start out with something easy (like a scarf) and work your way to more challenging pieces it makes a difference. There are a TON of videos on YouTube about beginner knitting. You can purchase inexpensive yarn and needles online. Give it a try!,This helped me,t3_gnwkng,0
