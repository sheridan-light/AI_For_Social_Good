depression,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",t3_doqwow,0

depression,"**TLDR**\- I'm ugly and I hate the way I look. Obsessed with dating apps for validation. Can't stop comparing myself with others. Struggle to make friends. Scared I will die alone. Depressed. Someone please give me advice on how to cope with this. I can't even use words to express how much I hate myself.

&amp;#x200B;

\[18F\] I absolutely hate the way I look. I have always been dark skinned with small eyes and a roundish face. My sister on the other hand has always been lighter skinned with beautiful big eyes and lashes and great bone structure. My only redeeming feature used to be my toned body but after going to college I gained 15 pounds in 3 months and thats when my self confidence completely plummeted. Now I am fat, dark and ugly.

I have never been in a relationship (I'm 18) and no guy has ever shown the slightest bit of interest in me (doesn't help that my sister is 16 and already been in 2ish relationships). In high school all my friends had guys asking them out left and right. Me on the other hand- I don't know a single guy who would even consider going out with me. Surprise surprise- I didn't have a prom date for either of my proms. Every night the last thing that I think before I go to bed is that I'm going to die alone and the first thing that I think in the morning is how ugly I am. This has also affected me academically because I spend all my time obsessing over my looks, or stalking pretty girls on Instagram or talking to random guys online.  I'm hooked onto dating apps because that is the only form of validation that I have or will ever receive from the opposite sex. While it gives me instant gratification, in the long run it just makes me feel like shit because I know none of these people actually care about me. It doesn't help when the people I'm talking to randomly ghost me since it lowers my already low self confidence. I've had a few hook ups but I'm always way more emotionally invested and ultimately when it doesn't work out I'm heart broken but I have to pretend like I don't care- after all it was just a hookup for them right?

I honestly don't know what to do. I am physically unable to cry about this because I just feel so dead. I just want someone to hold me and tell me how pretty I am once. Doesn't help that I'm not very extroverted and struggle to make friends, especially with the opposite sex. So not like there is much else I can distract my mind with. I currently only have 2-3 close friends and very few acquaintances so I don't even have a chance to meet anyone outside of dating apps (which as I've said before haven't worked out for me). Not like my looks do me any favors when it comes to this. I'm always so envious of pretty girls with no personality have a shit ton of friends and even when I try so hard to initiate conversation/meet new people no one gives a fuck about me. I am tired of lying about all the 'crazy sexual experiences' and 'boyfriends' that I've had to people. I doubt they even believe that I've had a boyfriend judging by how ugly I am. I just want something to love me. I'm tired of always being the awkward one at parties and the person that everyone talks over. Everyday I wake up praying for my skin to becomes one shade lighter or my eyes one inch bigger or my jawline 1% sharper but I'm stuck with the same ugly face. This is consuming my life and I am physically unable to detach my self worth from my uglyness.  I'm sorry this post became so long. I just had to get it all out. Honestly I can't stand it anymore. I wish I wasn't alive. Or maybe I can change that.

After I went to a deposition regarding an accident that happened in november (which is another messed up can of worms) my car blew a head gasket. I was stranded in not my state on the highway. I called AAA and due to distance reasons and covid, i guess, I couldn't take it home nor to my uncle's repair shop. So they took me to the nearest repair shop and I had to pay to get told the same thing I already inferred it was. This had already happened once before and the repairs were at the point it was more then the car. So it sits in that repair shop till today so I can junk it for cash

So for a week I've been getting rides from my boyfriend (who is a saint through all of this and has really been too kind) and my friends and family. But i hate relying on people so i only ride with them if i truly need it. Plus I work nights about half an hour from where I live so it's hard on them I know it. Wednesday  i found out there's a bus stop that goes to a walmart. So I stopped asking for rides so I can go over there and get money on a prepaid Visa to uber. I lost my credit card a while ago but it's in the samsung pay app and I can just move my money around more freely. My credit card declined trying to get this card because it was ""suspicious activity"" so I was stranded at walmart and begged one of my friends to take me home. That was a bad time. 

 I was supposed to get paid and get a car. But my check had been delayed and all the bull hockey with my credit card. And the junk lots not doing same day pick up when their website says they do same day pick ups (seriously I called 8. All of them not doing same day pickups and everyone condescending me because they had the ball to advertise ""same day pickup""). .. I should if known something was gonna happen with this too. The guy never showed. No word from him. I took my losses and went home. He said he was asleep when I tried to call him and text him. I'm giving him another chance today because if anyone understands falling asleep on someone. It's me. 

This leads to yesterday. Going back on the bus to get told to get off the bus because I was going the wrong way (in a very condescending tone I may add.) And the bus driver telling me to pick a more stable dream career... I was at walmart. My card took and now I have a card i can use. I go on the uber app and... nothing. It wouldnt take. This has happened before so i give it a zip code and... still nothing. Lyft wouldnt take either so with a dying phone battery I called a taxi. The card doesn't work on the taxi either because it uses square and needs a zip code. He said to go in and get cash back and I rush in there. Keep in mind at this point I'm running on over 24 hours without sleep and i got off of work 3 hours ago. I run into the walmart and physically go to the cashier. The card got declined. On a 88 cent snickers.  After I just put in my last $75.00 onto it. 

I SNAP

Laughing through the walmart I rush to get my stuff and telling the cab driver ""im sorry to waste your time but this isnt going to work. My card declined again"" and I'm rushing he asks ""why?"" 

And I scream ""BECAUSE FUCK MY LIFE!!!!!!""

 Laughing like a god damn maniac into the walmart probably giving the nice driver a heart attack or at least putting him in a very bad mood. I'm now in the produce section leaning on some pineapples trying to breath through my mask. The world is spinning and it feels like I'm the only one in it. Tears stream down my face. ""This isnt going to happen again. I cant take it anymore."" I think. ""I screwed up. I'm trying to handle everything but I just cant. I fuck up and my life isnt worth saving."" 

After i ""calm down"" I'm more into a rage mode through walmart. Just any fucking thing could trigger me. Thank god there were no whining children or I could of ended up on r/entitledperson for screaming at them to shut up. I was out of spoons to give.  I cash in my checks which I didnt want to do because I have an overdraft balance I  didnt want to pay off yet because it dipped into my car funds. Just fuming and freaking the fuck out. After that I got a charger and a light for my dungeon of a room.  Get my card onto lyft and drive home at 11:30 am. 

These panic attacks are getting bad. I usually go into my car and scream and cry and drive around. Its soothing to me. I know I cant do that anymore but it hurts. Life hurts. This wasnt as bad as other things I've been though so idk why it triggered it. I'm making a therapist appointment and a doctors appointment monday so I can start feeling ""better""  the aftermath feels like I wasnt even in my body as the freak out was happening. Like I dreamt it. But oj no I was there. I know I was there. I'm gonna call the guy and apologize for my behavior because it wasnt his fault. And I screamed at him. The aftermath makes me feel like the scum of the earth because i couldn't suppress it inside of me. I just physically couldn't. I try so damn hard but how long is it trying till it starts becoming failing? I scare myself with these kinds of episodes thinking it may one day lead me off the side of the road into a river.

depression,"Just need to get these thoughts down somewhere. I’m struggling, I haven’t felt content/okay in so long. The worst part is that I’m so hellbent on trying to figure out why I don’t feel right, but I can’t put my finger on it. I feel like I’m in a constant daily battle of feeling a bit off, then running with that feeling for the rest of the day in my head trying to deduce why/how I’m feeling off. I exercise for an hour and feel a little better, but the feeling returns and then there I go trying to figure it out/make it go away. The truth is either that the feeling doesn’t go away (that I only temporarily distract myself from it) or that the feeling returns everyday, all the time. The best way to describe the feeling is simply, discomfort. I just don’t feel comfortable/content. Whether it’s related to my future goals (grad school/career), my body image, how good of a brother/son/friend I am, generally anything, I just feel either like I’m not doing enough/failing myself in some capacity.

depression,"On Monday I admitted myself into the hospital for ""suicidal ideation"" as they called it. 

I've been depressed for about 15 years, since I was 10 or so. I was finally diagnosed around age 17. It worsened deeply in the summer before my freshman year of high school, shortly after my father was diagnosed with cancer. My life, obviously, hasn't been all bad. But it was a downward slope from that point and I honestly can't recall a time since that I've been genuinely happy. In 2011 my mother began using pills after a knee injury. To the point she'd steal my father's oxy. In 2014 she graduated to meth. In 2016 I spent three days watching my father die. That broke me pretty hard. That same year, a few weeks before my 21st birthday, my mom told me to kill myself and ""make the world a better place"". I didn't listen. But I'd be lying if I said sometimes I wish I had.  I've consistently held on to the naive hope that ""things will get better"". As of yet, though, they've only gotten worse. I've been through several family deaths. Deep, toxic issues with my husband. Postpartum depression after I had my daughter, and much more. 

Most recently I made the mistake of falling in love with another man. A long-time friend. I'm not saying it was right. But the few months we spent talking every day were the happiest I've been. I won't get into  details for the sake of the readers. It would be long. But we were caught and everhtbjng came tumbling down. My husband gave me another chance but I'm not sure I wanted it. The other man said he deeply loved me and would wait. But he didn't. He got back together with his wife and ceased contact with me. 

I feel so horribly broken and lost. He is everywhere around me and I'm feeling the weight of every sadness I've been though so much more heavily. Being alive seems to be just a burden. Some people aren't meant to be happy, I think. 

I hope, whoever is reading this, that life is kind to you. That you find beauty and love and softness in your endeavors. Never give up. You're meant to be here.

depression,"I guess what it comes down to is, I wish I had a shoulder to cry on. 

I constantly hear about how men’s emotions are repressed in our society, and I don’t disagree. 

But... I have never felt like I could express my own emotions either, at all. 

The way people talk about how men are told to “man up” and how they can’t express themselves, you’d think we live in some society where people encourage or at least allow girls to express themselves... this wasn’t true in my case, at all. 

I was raised by a super uneducated family in the middle of nowhere, Utah. Definitely a super patriarchal environment. “Strength” and “stoicism” (shallow bastardizations of those concepts) were prized above all. The absolute worst thing you could be, male or female, was “a pussy”. 

If me or my brother or my sister or anyone else cried, we’d be smacked across the face. “Cry, and I’ll give you something to cry about” 

As a girl, I honestly wonder if my emotions were even MORE repressed than my brother’s. Of course, it isn’t a competition, but... 

I kind of feel like at least in my culture (I still live in this bubble, although I’m living closer to the city in my own apartment now), if a girl cries, it’s immediately assumed that she’s being a drama queen, and nothing is actually wrong. You are screamed at, and laughed at, and frequently hit. If a guy cries, it’s assumed that something must ACTUALLY be wrong. (But don’t get me wrong! A crying boy will be laughed at and criticized as well, but not to the same degree...)

One egregious example: my parents TWICE refused to take me to the ER for several hours when I cried about a broken wrist I got when I was 7 and two broken fingers I got from soccer when I was 11. I rarely cry because I was conditioned not to, but when I did, they still thought I was just “being dramatic” and were shocked when they FINALLY agreed to take me to the doctor and they confirmed my bones were actually broken; I ended up needing surgery on my fingers because they seriously didn’t take me for over 24 hours. My brother, however, has never broken a bone, but once thought he broke his ankle when he was about 10. My parents IMMEDIATELY took him to the emergency room and when they found out he was actually fine, they argued with the doctors for hours, saying their son would never lie and he must be legitimately hurt. I have told this story on reddit before and people have told me that my parents must be narcissists and I must be the “scapegoat” or something, but I simply don’t think that’s the truth, because I have seen this in so many families in my church. Like my parents did a lot of seriously detrimental things, but this isn’t a simple case of favorite vs less favorite child. It wasn’t anything they were doing consciously. Girls are just assumed to be exaggerating, it’s a systemic thing.

Now I must reiterate that yeah I know that men’s emotions are definitely still repressed, boys around here aren’t allowed to cry either. But... 

I don’t know. I guess I really wish I had someone to talk to. Someone I could cry in front of. 

And people seem to imply that as a girl, it’s assumed I have that. And I don’t. And none of the girls that I know around here do either. We aren’t allowed to cry. We aren’t allowed to share our feelings. And we are even less allowed to express anger, or any of our opinions. In fact we constantly have to pretend to be 100% ok with whatever our brothers, fathers or boyfriends are doing, we always have to keep a smile. If we frown or accidentally drag our feet in sadness or frustration or anger, we’re labeled “bitches” and punished. Honestly, my ex and my brother and my male coworkers and my dad have all thrown tantrums quite often and it’s kind of accepted (nobody calls them “tantrums”, but they just get inconvenienced and start screaming until they get their way) and the women just have to cater to them... not to say all of them are abusive jerks, but men are given a pass here to yell at us and scream out in anger, but we women are really not allowed to bring up any grievances we have. If we do, we’re at the least “nagging”, at the most, satanic psychopaths. Seriously the women I know for the most part just walk on eggshells, do anything to keep the peace. In that sense it seems men are actually allowed to express their emotions more... 

And yeah I know that isn’t the case everywhere. This place is all I know, at least well. I am now dating a guy from a European country that definitely isn’t known for gender equality but is definitely not as misogynistic as my town, and I have left and gone to college and made friends from other states, religions, countries etc but this is the only one I know intimately. 

Idk. Like I said... I think every human being craves the opportunity to be vulnerable, to connect with others. I happen to be female and I am in desperate need of that as well and I don’t have it. And this idea society and reddit in particular seems to have is that as a woman I live in some sort of utopia where I can just spout my feelings and be supported, and nothing is further from the truth.",Any other women out there feel like they can’t express their emotions?,t3_gteawo,0

I'm fighting to make progress and be on a better track of handling it better.

But right now, I'm fighting for closeness since I'm alone most of the time. I don't mind being on my own when I have to be. It's just when my significant other is there I want to spend time with them.

I'm so used to us being together and them pushing me in the beginning to do things together. I wasn't so good with people in the beginning because of my pain and issues, so I understood why they did what they did. But now I'm used to that closeness all the time.

Early this morning, my grandpa passed away at the hospital. My grandma was right beside him. He was brought in on Sunday and the doctors told my grandma that he had pneumonia. 
We lost him today at 3:00am. 

My gramps had a good life. 
He was joyous, caring, fun and loving. Boy, was he loved and still is. He loved all 21 of his crazy grandchildren with every single bone in his body. A gentle man, he was. He was a towering 6’3ft and a man of steel, a coach, a father, a role model, a fighter, a change maker and a grandpa - which he absolutely loved being.
I will say this - and sorry gramps - he could not cook at all. The man could boil an egg and toast some toast but that’s about it, besides making a Root Beer Float, which I don’t think really counts. He had a RBF every other day - I lived with my grandparents. Every time my grandma would leave the house, he would give me the face, the “let’s make an RBF” face.

I absolutely adore those memories of him and I, or him, my cousins and I sitting at the dining table or outside drinking the only drink he could possibly make with the sun hitting our faces, not talking but just living in harmony and love. Of course, RBFs weren’t just all, he loved popsicles, animals and gardening. He had a little - not really little - gardening outfit with a fashionable hat, some sturdy gardening shorts and mid-calf white socks. He would spend every single day in that garden of his. Proud of his blossoming buds, his row of tomatoes, his field of corn and his handmade greenhouse. He was 
actually quite obsessed with buying new seeds, every week he would get some more. It was one of his many passions.

He was a dedicated man.

I don’t know why I am making this post, feels weird but also it feels good to get this out. I’m a closed off person to the people in my real life, I can’t open up well... I am also a writer. My gramps journaled every single day, so it’s safe to say I got it from him. For him, it was his way of getting his emotions out, I understood that and I understand why I do it. 

Yeah, I am heart broken. 

I don’t quite know what to do other than cry with my whole body, write sad poems or posts, stare at my fish or just lay down and do nothing. It’s devastating. I live 8 hours away from him, there’s a global pandemic and a civil war breaking out in the States. There’s no celebration of his life because we aren’t allowed. 
How freaking devastating. 

I lost a big piece of me today. I lost my father figure, my grandpa, my coach, my cheerleader, and my RBF partner. I really love this man with everything. 

Guess I ought to buy myself some A n’ W root beer, Byers vanilla ice cream and sit in some lush nature, and cheers to you, gramps.

depression,"

My friend is 20 and we met in university shared student housing.
She had a boyfriend a few years her senior.
Her early life she was abused terribly by her mother and step father. her father commited suicide and she was blamed for it by her mother.


Her boyfriend seemed to be of good stock until about the time she moved to university.
She had unfortunate complications with a pregnancy and lost the baby.
According to her, he was never the same suffering from multiple personailties and blaming her for the loss of the baby.
Recently he has grown violent, paranoid when she is around other men he is jealous and angry. He has even gone as far as to rape her and threatened her with a knife.


About 2 days ago, another friend and I convinced her that it was in her interest and the abusive boyfriends to get him arrested, that way she would be safe and he would get the treatment he needs for his disorder.


She didnt want to go through with it. She felt guilty for all the upset that was occuring, and that she still loved him. She understood what he did, all the implications of it but she just wanted someone to cuddle and let her problems go away.


I relented and said that we should phone the police to discuss what options were available. She revealed only minor details to the police, but this was enough for them to arrest him, much to her dismay.


She has been distrought about this, worrying about his well being and safety, even when he was let out and found out to be home.


She has called me 3 times every day since, it is midday as of now and she has already called me once. I am not with her as I am home due to Corona but she is stuck down there. I have a friend who is close enough that he can chdck in on her, but he is growing numb to it as he has visited 3 times over the past 2 days, over the concern of her suicide.


I do not blame him, i am growing tired too. I have had many convosations, passionate speeches about how she is going to be fantastic and everythjng will get better... but nothing helps... she is in the darkest place she can be right now. I dont know what she wants other than to kill herself and im not there so i just phone up, talk and be useless.


I dont know how to help her. I fear there isnt long before she doesnt call me, and just ends her life. She feels so guilty about the situation.


As of writing this, she hung up on me so i called my friend who has gone round to make sure she doesnt do anything stupid. He is consoling her now. And all she wants is 1 of 2 people, either her Nan (who is dead) or her abusive boyfriend because 'not even my own mother knows me...


Neither me nor my friend know what to do to help. It feels like we are just helping her cling on and that nothing is being achieved. 
What should we do?
I have advised seeing mental help people, the hospital etc
As of now, my friend is calling he non emergency help nhs number and i am writing this.

depression,"Hello there. You're probably here because you're struggling with depression, too. But there have been times in both of our lives where we've overcome some of the obstacles depression presents. So, as a disclaimer, I'd like to say that your opinion is probably worthwhile. There's likely a nugget of wisdom amidst what might regularly feel like failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking some relationship advice. I've been in a relationship for many years now. I love my partner a lot. But despite our connection and time together, I still regularly struggle with mental illness. This strains my self-esteem/identity within the relationship, where I feel like a ""burden."" Like an ultimately toxic person not worth the time investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Being told I'm not a burden only temporarily helps. Basically/essentially asking for that reassurance regularly adds to this overall guilt. It keeps on stacking, I see it happening, and I don't know how to just...accept it. Just let myself be loved, get over it, and focus on the better parts of living. Somehow, every time I need emotional connection/communication/comfort, there's a deep worry that \*this time will push it over the edge.\* We've been together for a very long time, and that hasn't ever happened. But I seem like too much, to myself. I want to ""get over it"" magically, but I legitimately feel badly about having been \*so much,\* it's like I have to compensate. And/or, definitely/absolutely get better (to redeem all of their struggle and time).

&amp;#x200B;

I think the worry stems from ultimately not knowing if I'm going to get better. I keep thinking I might. I keep trying. But I really don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me, if you can relate to any of this...How do you manage that uncertainty in your own life/relationships? What helps you feel like less of a burden and mitigate those burdensome worries? How do you grapple with guilt?

My family also has quite a few other health and financial issues. I can't burden my problems on top.

I'm in my early 20s now and for the first time I moved out of my parents place and live alone about 9 months ago. This was because I never went to university and just went straight to working in IT. I managed to get a decent paying job eventually and decide it was important to learn how to live independently.

Looking back I think this was just me getting fixated on a random idea of escape because I really didn't like my job and wanted out. My entire department ended up getting let go from that job in mid February and I've been unemployed since.

I'm meant to be applying for jobs or working on stuff that will look good on a CV but instead I just smoke loads of weed every day, watch TV shows I don't really care about and attempt to play games I just don't enjoy anymore. I hate it.

I've always just stumbled from job to job and while what I do now is a good job with decent earning potential and I am pretty good at it it's in no way fulfilling and it just hurts seeing people put all this time and work into a project that is for a faceless corporation who couldn't give a shit about you and will give you not recognition for it. And it's not even like you do it for the pride, the only difference in the world it makes is to make someone else even richer.

I now have no idea what I should do next. I'm running out of savings to cover my rent so I could just move back with my parents. I could get another job in the field I don't like which I know will make me majorly depressed in about 7 or 8 months.

depression,"Hi guys! This is my first post ever and I've been feeling a little down lately : (

So let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt how much fun they had in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive and I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and crying, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one even bothered inviting me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled.

depression,"So before i start, i guess what i learnt from this situation is that my happiness has to come from myself and i cant rely on anyone else to make me happy. Others are there to boost it and to pick me up if i get down. 

I recently came out of a weird ldr that lasted 2 months where me and this girl talked everyday, like all day, called often usually for an hour or more. She made out she really loved me i mean she told me that, shed tell me she wanted me, and want me in her bed and wants to sleep with me all the time. Shed send nudes and so would I. We'd sext sometimes and say some lovey dovey shit she seemed to enjoy and i was quite happy to reciprocate everything because i genuinely did grow to love her. She complemented me on stuff no one has said to me before and made me feel special. And i did the same to her. Because imo she was gorgeous. She would make me make promises and reassure her that i was sincere. I thought it was because she was maybe a little insecure and just unsure if i was sincere (which i always was btw) and it turns out she was the one who wasn't sincere. Turned out she had a boyfriend who just doesnt give her any attention and so thats where i came into play i suppose. 

Like i know im only 21 but ive been trying to get a gf for a good part of 8 years now. I do t know if its just the kinda people i attract but its been the same story for me always. People playing with me for literally no reason, i dunno if i just attract sociopaths or something, that could be it? Idk. I feel like a bit of a clown tbh.

U know especially at uni when everyone else around me are getting gf's or one night stands on nights out (not that i want that) but i kinda feel like im just invisible. But im not, like i make people laugh and people seem to enjoy my company (im really not blowing my own trumpet here either btw). I just dont know where im going wrong, i feel like im the same as other people, like im not some alien chimpanzee hybrid species, im just human lol. Idek.

It sucks that the only person who i have ever thought actually loved me, was faking it. I wonder if anything she said about me was true, are my vampire fangs cool, is my deep voice attractive, is my athletic body attractive? Like she says she wasnt lying but yet why should i trust anything she says when she pretended to love me. Like how does that even work? How can u spend so much time with someone and pretend to love them? Like whats the purpose? Just some messed up fantasy in there mind? but theres a real person on the other side, why would u do that?

Anywho ive had 2 ways of looking at it. 1. The stuff she told me is true and i should be more confident in myself and have some self worth or 2. Im unlovable, maybe my depression really effects my behaviour more than i noticed and i am weird af (its hard to tell from the inside because it's just me innit?!) And the only way someone will love me is for them to fake it.

depression,"I'll first start with a bit of a background of myself. I'm 21 and recently dropped out of college after my third year, because of the biggest realization I ever had hit me. What am I really doing in school? I thought I wanted to find a job with my Psychology degree, but now I realize there is nothing I could enjoy as a job with that degree, so what a waste of three years. I really believe now I was just staying in college to avoid the next step in life, working until you die. And then I thought to myself, when could I ever enjoy work when I don't even know what I want to do anymore, so then everything that comes will just be a depressing job. I found myself all of a sudden hating the idea of work, because it is required to live life. That just seems unfair to me. Especially now because I would have to work just to get by with minimum wage probably for who knows how long. What a depressing existence I just all of a sudden realized. I also have been single my whole life so the idea of sharing my time with someone I love seems nonexistent at this point, and I don't know if I will ever find love, because I am very socially awkward when talking with girls and overall just really bad at getting out there. So that to me is some of the biggest reasons to live life; money and love. Without money, you can't survive in the world and without love it's meaningless. So what is the purpose of life when you are forced into a world with a set of rules that you have to abide by to live. You can't just live, you have to work and make money to live. But I have such an urge to not work because of the depressing exitance that working forever gives. It just seems like something that society has excepted and expected because no one can do anything about it. So I don't know what to do anymore if my existence on this planet is going to be forced to follow the norm, and there is no way out of it. Suicide seems like the only way out, because at that point it's over, but I have such a hard time wanting to actually go through with it because I will hurt my parents and family, who seem content with life now. And the next step to not working is becoming homeless and probably dying from starvation or freezing to death one night, that seems worse than suicide to me. There is no way to live on earth and survive without work, and the fact I feel like I will never find love makes it that much worse. I don't know how I can ever feel any different at this point because life seems so fucked up too me. This was definitely a rant, but if anyone has any tips to make life seems worth it, I with take them.

depression,"Hello, 

I reached out on this platform and a few other subs a couple months back. Here is my post. You can see in my post history that I posted it in several subs. I really didn’t think anyone would respond to me so I tried to put it in front of as many eyes as I could. I’ll do the same with this post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f18zg2/please_read_me_i_did_terrible_things_when_i_was_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I didn’t expect to get so much attention and replies. I am eternally grateful for the support and advice I received. And I apologize I didn’t respond to everyone. Trying to work through this gives me really bad anxiety, to the point where I tremble and vomit. 

I still hate my self and still can’t forgive my self. I feel now that my only option to move forward is I have to reach out to these girls and apologize. For the last couple of months I have been looking for them. I made a blank Facebook to try and find them, I was able to find 3 of the 4 pretty easily. For the one who I didn’t remember her name (CB), I went on a dudes Facebook who I knew befriended every person he could and looked through everyone of his 2,000 plus friends and looked at their faces to see if I could find her, and what do you know, I did. 

I will use the code names from my previous post to identify the girls. LC and CB are now married, and CB has 3 children. Also CB is an kinda a conspiracy theorist and her profile is filled with the deep state and Bill Gates is putting tracking chips in us, the works. That makes me nervous reaching out to her. LC is happily married and I’m hesitant to reach out because what if she has already moved on, and my message will bring back traumatic memories. 

Though I haven’t been able to find the 4th, DL, until I get a random call. I get robo calls but not often and no one talks to me anymore, so it’s highly unusual for me to get a call. I don’t know why but I answered this one and when she realized she called me, I could hear the anxiety and fear in her voice. And that’s when I knew it was her. It’s been over 10 years and she still has my number and I can tell what I did haunts her. For a recap she is the one who I met a dance party and while making out I put my hand in her pants without her permission. There is a lot more details about the incident in my previous post. She is also a Mormon. She is happily married with children and has become friends with some of the people I was friends with while in high school. 

Back to the call, she just said she had the wrong number and hung up. Though now that I had her phone number I was able to find her name on google and then her on Facebook. Seeing her face, I know it’s her and I’ve now got the chance to apologize to all my victims. I know I could call or text her, but I don’t feel like that is as appropriate because I’m sure my apology will be a couple thousand words and I don’t want to call because that doesn’t give me the chance to really format what I want to say. 

But I’m stuck in this step now. Every time I try to write out what I want to say my anxiety gets so bad that I shake uncontrollably. My perception is clouded with fear and self hatred. I’m afraid I can’t think rationally enough to compose a sincere apology letter.

I am so afraid that they will admit what I did traumatized them, and I don’t think I can live with my self knowing that. I have only suspected that and it was enough for me to want to put a gun to my chest. I’m also afraid that when I do they will use it as proof and oust me, which honestly I don’t want to happen, but that’s their right and I cannot object to that. If that’s what they feel like they have to do, then I have to support them. They are the victims here, not me. 

When I’m ousted I’m afraid of my friends and families reactions. I have been under the impression that if they knew the truth about what I had done they would understand why I had to kill my self. I’m also afraid that their rejection will push me over the edge of suicide. 

As of now I know I’m too much of a coward to kill my self, I’ve been there, tried that and I couldn’t do it. I love the idea and beauty of life but absolutely hate my self. I cannot continue like this or with my self if I don’t reach out. The way I’m living now is miserable, I want to move on but can’t.

I know this is about me, this is about me wanting to move forward, which is wrong and selfish. It needs to be about them, about what I did to them, how it was wrong and about apologizing to them. 

I don’t want to tell them that I am suffering because I don’t want them to feel at blame. Most of them are apart of the Mormon church and the church hasn’t always handled sexual assault and rape very well. From other Mormon rape victims testimonies, the church would rather suppress these incidents as the blame is sometimes moved to the women. 

But I also feel like if they knew how much I have suffered they would know my apology is sincere and would be more inclined to forgive me. But that right there is wrong. I feel like that is me using my suicide as a guilt trip for their more likely forgiveness. 

I am probably the most terrified that she will confirm what I had done traumatized her and caused her a lot of pain. I think that will give me the push and courage I need to actually go through with killing my self. But I don’t want to kill my self, I don’t want my life to end, but I don’t think I’ll be able to live with my self or with the rejection of my friends and family.
 
I would really appreciate any feedback or advice you can give me about how I can format it.

What my mind tells me is to try and make everything about them, not reveal any of my suffering and purely make my apology about what I did to them and how it was wrong.

But, my anxiety tells me to share my suffering with them so they understand that I am sincere and make them more likely to forgive me. But like I said earlier, that’s wrong and manipulative. 

Also, my suffering might bring them satisfaction as I have caused them trauma. But that, I would understand and be okay with that. 

But in reality, I am in no way able to think straight or rationally. My anxiety is out of control and I cannot get my self out of this depressive pit I’ve dug my self into. My existence is miserable and I don’t want to live like this anymore. That’s why I need your help and guidance.

depression,"I am a fat person. I'm the kind of fat person that most people casually make fun of. I'm the kind of fat person that reddit condemns. I'm the kind of fat person that people refuse to sit next to on public transportation. I'm the kind of fat person that strangers harass. One time on the train, completely unprovoked, a man spit in my face, called me a whale, and told me to fucking die.

I'm the kind of fat person who lives in such immense shame about her body that I do everything I can to stay locked up in my home, even before the pandemic. I work from home, I don't date, and I rarely socialize in person. I try not to go outside. Sometimes I don't even get out of bed. I hate my body and I hate myself.

I live with my parents. Every day, my mother (who had also struggled with weight and obesity, but is now at a healthy weight) gives me a hard time about my weight. I don't blame her. I know it must be hard for her to see me, to have given birth to someone and watch them slowly become such a worthless fat piece of shit.

Every other day she says, ""One day, you'll just snap out of it. You'll get sick of being fat and depressed and you'll do something about it.""

The thing she doesn't realize is that I have that kind of moment every other day. There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not sick of my fucking body, depression, and anxiety. And every week I plan and promise myself that I'm going to ""turn it all around."" But it never happens. Why?

Because for me, depression is a crippling illness. I can't explain it but every time I try to do anything to improve myself, I become overwhelmed and I end up shutting down. And then I literally just lay down for days.

depression,"Hi everyone,  I (14F) was just wondering for some advice from anyone on what to do.

Around a week ago, my psychiatrist wrote me a prescription for fluoxetine (or as you Americans call Prozac), though there was no real pressure to take it (because my form of depression is moderate and I am not an adult). Considering I've been seeing my psychologist on and off for a year or so (with little improvement), I took them once the form was filled out a couple of days after (though before the whole psychiatrist thing I was against medication). Wrong move.

&amp;#x200B;

Within an half an hour or so I felt awful - sweats, nausea and shitty headaches… and then I threw up (which can be a common side effect when being introduced, but I rarely get sick). And it sort of hit me — do I need this right now? I did some research and the side effects aren't grand. I go back to school soon and don't want to deal with this awful sickness for a few weeks. I haven't touched them since, but depression has kept me from my studies and I feel my grades and overall performance slipping away… I can't concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and I feel so much strain like I'm about to have a breakdown. Some of you Redditors yourselves have commented not to take Prozac, but again… school.

depression,"So obligatory disclaimer, first post in this sub, but long time sufferer of bipolar depression and severe ADHD. I am a 23 years old, the only son, and the youngest of my (7) siblings. For what seems like my entire life, I've felt ignored, like a burden on the people I care about, and generally forgotten unless one of my siblings needs my help. Things really took a turn for the worse when my mother passed from cancer and my closest in age sister and I inherited her house. Obviously this was very hard on me, and I fell very hard into drug use as a result. During this period of time, I admit, I probably wasn't the best brother or son, and I took advantage of the kindness of my family mostly financially (never stole, just borrowed. Everything has been paid back in full), but within the last couple years I started to resolve my own issues. Getting closer to healthy has been the hardest battle I've ever fought, and I'm very proud of the progress I've made as of recently. Along with me regaining control of my life, I also got very involved in the trades as a physical outlet and as a short term career. As a result I'm constantly being asked for ""favors"" from my sisters including, but not limited to fixing their cars, fixing everything in our family home, helping them move, literally remodeling portions of their house (60 hr weeks while not being able to take work), and being strong armed into being underemployed by my dad repeatedly. I've never charged any of my sisters for work I've done from them, because according to them I owe them something. I almost never get anywhere near as much help as I give, and I've accepted that, but what I can't accept is being told I need to do more, being told that my sleep isn't as important as the favors they ask me, being told that I'm not allowed to take a few days for my mental health, being ignored in conversation, being treated as a literal child unless they want my help, and basically never being allowed to make decisions for myself without being severely reprimanded. Like it's getting to the point where I can't even make plans with my friends for an hour after work, because ""I've got too much going on at home."" They even try to control how I spend my hard earned money, but don't know how hard my job is (commercial carpenter), and don't care how tired I am when they ask me these favors. I feel like I have no privacy, no me time, and dwindling self worth from all of this. I honestly don't know what to do short of walking away from all of them, but this isn't an option, since the sister I live with and I are the only ones maintaining the bills for our family house. I've talked to all of them about considering my mental health, and how physically tired I am before they ask too much of me, but all of those conversations just result in me being told I'm acting selfish. If I knew becoming healthy would make me this miserable I'd have gladly just stayed a low life loser.

depression,"I went out to a party for the first time in probably about 8 months. Let me preface this by saying I'm young but the years after I graduated high school I partied pretty much every weekend which. I've always had social anxiety so whenever I went out I had to drink. This has led to a couple of embarrassing nights. Nights wherever I've fought, blacked out and done super embarrassing shit, and just pure stupidy. Nights I seriously regret and make me feel like a shitbag human being. So I've stopped drinking and going out. I've been pretty much just working and that's it, well I was up having some really tough times with my thoughts. So I said to myself lets go for a ride whilst in the middle of the ride my phones blowing up and its all my buddies saying come to so and so. I usually make up some bullshit excuse and don't go. Well, tonight I said fuck it and went over, saw people I haven't seen in a couple of months to a year. I didn't drink at all and the night was going well, people were telling me how much they missed me and hyping me up you know how it goes around, drunk people. None of my friends know I'm going through some mental issues, and they're bringing up crazy times that we've had together. Honestly, none of it was bothering me and it actually made me feel better, being asked how come they haven't seen in me so long and all this other shit. As soon as I got home I was just overcome by the feeling of shame and guilt. The shame of the shit I've done drunk, and the guilt of some of the shit I've said to people. I don't know, I know deep down I'm not a shit person. But some of the things I've done fights, being a dick to people, etc haunts me. I've told the people I was a dick to sorry and such. I just can't get away from these thoughts though. Especially knowing that some people only know of me in that light haunts me. I'm ashamed of myself, self-conscious, and anxiety-ridden 24/7.

depression,"I keep seeing discussion on how people with mental illness are toxic and shouldn’t even be touched with a 6 inch pole, but it’s this same exact attitude that leads to emotional and psychological abuse towards mentally ill people.

Not everything bad that happens in a relationship between two people is going to be on the shoulder of the one with depression. We are not magically invincible from being treated like crap the moment we develop depression. When a person starts being toxic towards a person with depression they  don’t go “oh this person has depression, fair enough, I’ll go somewhere else”. 

I wish there more discussion on how mental illness is exploited in relationships. How having a partner with depression make the other person think, “I’m not being a jerk, this person just have skewed perspective on me because of their depression”. That is psychological abuse. 

The “their mental illness is not your responsibility” narrative created an us vs them tension and creates an “other” group that continues to silence the voices of those with mental illness that rightfully demands to be treated with equality and humanity.

Mental illness advocate advocates to de stigmatiz mental illness treatment, but we treat people with mental illness themselves as second class citizens.

Fuck. Even mass shooters were found not to be mentally ill despite people and news media pushing that so hard. Turns out they were completely sane, but hateful men who wanted to kill.

We jump so quickly to pathologies/arm chair diagnose someone else or scapegoat someone’s mental illness because that is much easier from having to take a good look at ourselves instead.","No it’s not my depression, you’re just being really shitty right now.

depression,So this is going to be a long story so sit back and relax. So I met this guy (Nathaniel) in preschool and we didn’t like each other we were always fighting well fast forward a few years to eighth grade and he’s dating my friend and we constantly competed for her attention. So me and him ended up becoming best friends in the process and they broke up and eventually she stopped hanging out with me. Then high school came along and he got feelings for me but I didn’t feel the same and I ended up getting into an abusive relationship that I was trapped in two years later sophomore year he still had feelings for me and I ended up getting out of that relationship. So eventually I started liking him but by the time I started liking him he didn’t like me back but not only that I had told my friend that I liked him and that I wanted to date him and he told me he might date me then things went downhill quick I found out they were talking. So they both told me that they wouldn’t date like they both promised me and I was like OK but I need to take some time for myself so I took two weeks away from them because I was stressed. So when I came back he asked her out even though he told me he wouldn’t and I felt betrayed because those were my best friends and they straight up told me they would not date and then they did anyways but you know they didn’t work out. So now I’m in junior year of high school and I know I’m in high school I’m gonna be plenty of guys but I really don’t know what to do in the situation because it got worse. So it got to the point where he was basically my only friend and we do and talk about everything together and he still has feelings for me or at least he did I’m getting to that. So basically early this year I started dating a boy named Cayleb and he had a sister named Earris sadly they had to move away to another state and I had to break up with Cayleb so I got into a relationship with another abusive guy but me and Earris were best friends and we talked every day and we told each other everything just like me and Nathaniel. Earris and Nathaniel didn’t have the best relationship like they were friends and all but Nathaniel got annoyed by her and wasn’t really interested in her. Well eventually one day Nathaniel asked me out and I said yes because I wasn’t really into him but I knew I could trust him and I felt like I couldn’t trust anybody but him but the next day my ex was trying to kill himself because I was with Nathaniel so Nathaniel said I don’t want to do this if someone’s going to try and kill themselves maybe we should wait and I agreed. Then he came to me telling me he’s obsessed with his ex Tracy still then a few days later he said he’s over her and he was trying to get with me. And we were flirting and he even told me he loved me but he was scared to get with me that’s initially why he got with my friend instead of me in the first place the year prior to this. But you know he was still trying to go out with me and I was gaining feelings for him and I had planned a date with him. I Was actually supposed to go on the date with him tomorrow but things changed and shit came up. Today I was talking to him and he tells me he got engaged to Earris and I’m like well what the fuck you didn’t have feelings for her you’ve been obsessed with me and she’s my best friend. So he told me it started out as a joke and they were jokingly engaged but then they started flirting and he had feelings for her even though they only talked for a few hours and then he decided that he never had feelings for me all along and he just thought he did and he was now going to drop me to go for this girl and this girl knew that I liked him as well and she did the same thing so the only two people I could trust fucked me over and he did this to me again. It’s not even like I usually have feelings for this guy I just see him as a friend most of the time but then he gets feelings for me and I start to like him but then he gets all scared of dating me and such and he stops having feelings for me and then goes out with one of my friends and fucking betrays me. But I can’t drop him because he’s the closest person I have I really want to drop both of them but the one guy is the closest person I have and I don’t really have anybody else but if he’s going to keep toying with my emotions just because he can’t decide whether he actually wants to date me or not like I don’t know what to do. Tells me that he scared of dating me because he’s afraid he’s going to accidentally say something bad and hurt me and it’s going to ruin what we have but he has no problem impulsively dating girls that he’s only liked for a day. Anyways I start talking to the girl Because he had been asking to take me to dinner anyways because he felt bad and turns out she put him up to it so I was like fuck no I’m not going to his dinner why the fuck would I go to dinner just because he feels bad because he fucking betrayed me because he likes another girl that would just make shit awkward so then I’m just like you know what I still care about him but this other girl like me and her are really close and she would drop him and hurt him over me because I’m hurt so I decided that I need to drop that girl so she doesn’t hurt him and break things off with him because at the end of the day I still care about him and I don’t want anybody to hurt him. Usually when a guy does shit like this to me I hurt them back and ruin their month or maybe even a year but every time he’s done stuff like this to me I couldn’t bring myself to hurt him or get revenge. I just don’t know what to do because I’m afraid that this is going to happen again because I’m not stupid I mean obviously his relationship isn’t going to work out but I don’t wanna be any part of that but what if he starts doing this shit to me again what if he tells himself he likes me and he truly believes that he likes me but when it comes down to it he really doesn’t like me and he just hurts me again because at this point I mean him and Earris were the only two people I can trust but now I can’t trust anybody because those are the only two people that hadn’t really fucked me over or at least not in a long time for Nathaniel‘s case. I mean the first time he did this shit to me I for gave him but I don’t know if I can now. And the thing is it’s like I fucking resent him now and I feel bad about that but it’s just he can’t do anything to redeem himself ever like he’s not gonna be able to do anything to make this up to me but I don’t wanna have this grudge between us for the rest of our lives so what can I do to get over this but not distance myself from him or hurt our friendship.,I feel so betrayed what do I do?,t3_gtamfx,0

depression,"My apologies if this doesn’t fit this sub, and also that I’m cross posting it a few places, but I just need to get my thoughts out. I’ve always known my dad was depressed to an extent. That he got anxious. But I got anxious too. My wife suffers from depression and anxiety, and it doesn’t overwhelm our lives. But I learned last night that these things have been overwhelming my father’s life and coming to grips with it is so difficult.

He has been having a tough time at work for a while. But this is a guy who raised six kids. Beat cancer twice. He’s provided for our family and been an example of what a father should be to me. I’m the man and father I am today because of him. Even in my late-30s, I still kind of viewed my dad, a big 6’4 teddy bear, as a super hero. But stress and depression and anxiety and mental illness has boiled over with him. 

We ended up in the ER last night. Of course I couldn’t go in because of covid-19. He was (pardon me if I use a term in correctly) acting manic and going through thought loops, repeating himself, interspersed with crying and yelling. And it’s all because of being treated badly (at least he thinks he is) at his job. That’s it. And when I tried to explain that his kids matter and grandkids matter, and none of us care about how well he does at his job (he could retire today and be ok—granted they would be on a fixed income, but he would be alright), he told me that his job does matter as much as all that, and then he burst out crying. I think that’s when I realized how bad it was. He said he wanted to kill himself, but wouldn’t only because of his life insurance policy (which I guess excludes it).

I wish they could’ve kept him at the hospital, but he claimed he wasn’t considering self-harm, and the meds calmed him down. The doctor said he hasn’t slept for a couple of days and just needed his anxiety down. I was hopeful when I got him in the car all would be well, but it wasn’t. More ranting and crying. And I learned from my mother that this wasn’t the first time. Not something new. It has been happening for years and I didn’t know how bad it was. 

He’s agreed to see a professional Monday. I slept maybe an hour last night. He wants to have a big talk today about ways to go after his employer (I am a lawyer). But I’ll tell him what I’ve told him before: Being crappy doesn’t mean you have a legal claim. And I know how that will go. I’m dreading it. I just wish they had kept him for a psych evaluation instead of needing to wait until next week. I wish I understood how had it had been and for how long. I know he isn’t choosing this, and that’s it’s mental and emotional torture for him, and I feel guilty for being angry at him.

I’m not sure what is next, or how to handle it. I don’t feel strong enough.

But I’m just rambling now. I just wanted to get my thoughts out to some kindly internet strangers. My heart and soul goes out to those who suffer like he does. But like him, you are loved (so loved). I love you, even if I don’t know you. Thank you for reading.

depression,"I recently picked up on Reddit now that I feel I have the time to often check it, and because of that I made this anon-like account for, ya know things that I don't want to be public about me. I know this will get lost in the void of Reddit, but I know it feels slightly better when writing this down. Somehow, it does.

People often say that writing it down like this will make you feel better. Or that going to sleep will make you feel better in the morning, and that things will pass. But it always comes back. And i'm sick of it.

Let me try to put this in words that will make you understand... and I really hope (but doubt) anybody I know actually see's this, because i'm gonna try to make this pretty descriptive...

In January of 2018, I was a Freshman at a charter school that went from K-9, so there was no real hierarchy or higher status above me at this school. For a long time, I was known as the kid who would be loud and disruptive, and always trying to be funny. It worked sometimes, but I began to tell around 8th grade that people were sick of it, and I felt hated without being told so. 

I don't know what happened, but one day I just broke. I came to school after Christmas break with suppressed emotions and a quiet demeanor, which I know must have seemed odd for my peers. I often stayed silent, with my head down, and just working on school work to keep my mind off what I was feeling. I didn't eat, instead I would either put my head down in the Lunchroom corner, or sit outside, rain or snow, on a single bench and just watch a field of nothingness.

Every day, I would walk my way home, and avoid talking to my father, who almost always stayed home, as he is a retired vet who has medical problems and such. My issues with him would take a long time to talk about, he's not abusive or non-loving, he's just not right to me, and I don't like being around him. 

Nonetheless, I would do whatever chores that were needed to be done, and just lay in bed watching YouTube on my phone, trying to keep my mind off things. When my stepmom comes home (who I should mention is a really good mom, and I love her. So don't think she's bad at all...), I would try my best to pretend i'm busy, and when I have to talk, I act happy and normal, however I did say I was often tired. I went to ""sleep"" pretty early those nights. And I remember at one point or another for some reason I began watching clips on self harm, and suicide. Something about those topics always were interesting to me on a psychology standpoint, and the next thing I know I was screwing out the razor from my pencil sharpener, and I began cutting my arm. It felt, painful, but it did feel exactly how other people  describe self harm, it translates the mental pain to physical pain. Because it was winter, I had no problems hiding this from people around me. We had to wear a school branded jacket all day in class anyway, and I've been known for preferring to wear hoodies in the first place. 

Sooner or later, I began thinking about suicide. I remember some nights where I was researching about what pill hurts the least, as I wanted to die, just with no pain. Now I understand it's basically impossible to die without some form of pain. Every night, I contemplated and tried mapping out plans on how to kill myself. My Dad's medical problems ensured that we had a surplus of medication all over the house, so it wasn't difficult to sneak a bottle of Tylenol past my parents. For a while, I would carry a bottle in my bag, and whenever I was feeling really fucking bad, I would pop one in my body, making a system that I thought would outcome to; ""if i'm feeling such pain all day, the more pills I take, the better chance I have of dying"". It was a stupid and flawed idea, obviously.

While these weeks were going on, there were obviously some people who reached out to me. Some teachers asked why I was so quiet, and I just told them I wanted to work harder. While other students, some I didn't know would have cared about me, reached out to me as well. I don't want to say that these people really ""hated"" me. I was never bullied there. It's just the people that I thought I was annoying were more just disliked by me. I guess not so much though, as even a girl that I thought really hated me because of something I did two years prior, she was the first one who asked if I was okay. I would go from class to class, and she would sometimes confront me and try to understand how I felt. I knew why she was doing it, because I know that she dealt with the same issues.

She was the only one that I felt really cared for me, and I didn't understand why. I remember there was a day when she saw my arm, and it got me really scared that others would hear about it, or worse any teachers. Today, i'm pretty sure no teachers knew about it, but I'm quite sure that other students knew, in some way.

Over a span of two months, I had two (albeit weak) suicide attempts. Nobody knew about them, but i'm sure some could have thought that that's the path I was thinking of. While in this depressive state, I realized my grades were becoming really good. Most likely because of me wanting to suppress my thoughts by working. Yet, I was not feeling any better. My best friend began coming out to me at lunch and asking to please talk to him, but I ignored him. I felt so bad. I felt like I was putting him in corner, and forcing him to befriend other people, which is kinda what happened. He more started talking to the people that were kinda my friends. You have to understand that at this school, there were not a lot of students in the grade, so just about everybody was a part of one big clique, split into little subgroups. We were like a family.

Here on out is where I made my biggest regrets in this story.

I feel that I put the people that I loved lives in danger.

I was not in a good place.

But for now, I really need to stop typing, because this is getting too long, it's late, and i'm already feeling bad enough as it is.

For anybody (I doubt there is anybody) who read this whole thing, thanks for trying to understand.

If I feel like this again, and for all I know could be tomorrow night, I might continue whatever this is.

Know that there is no happy ending to this story, because i'm still not in a good place. Maybe not as bad, but still bad. In fact, I think the past three years have ruined my life. But maybe I could let you know how I did that later.

Please don't comment on this reassuring me that life will get better, or that i'm a good person. You don't know that. For all you know i'm a child killer. Just know that I love you, I love you for reading this, and I love you for existing. I will refuse any love back, because I don't feel I want that.

Everything just hurts.

depression,"As the title says, I'm doing OK. I'm not great, I still struggle but I just wanted to say something to all who are suffering like myself. 
I've worked hard for so long. I'm 29F and I was diagnosed at 15. I didn't have a great life growing up, my dad was physically abusive and my step dad was verbally. I'm sure he would have escalated to physical abuse but it's hard to get away with it when my own brothers and HIS own kids warned what would happen if he did. I was told I wouldn't have kids when I was 16. My bio mom didn't raise me, but i was never really allowed to ask and the whole story is another chapter. 
When i graduated high school i joined the military. I buried my depression to prove to some of my family i would amount to something one day. 
Today i have a wonderful husband who sadly deployed at the moment. I've been going to therapy for the past 6 years regularly but due to covid the last time I saw my therapist was in Feb. I got to see her yesterday and filled her in on the past three months. It included a hard fallout with my MIL and SIL and it led to me cutting them out of my life with hubby's knowledge and understanding. 
My MIL never worked for anything in her life. Her father took care of her till he passed. When we had the falling out, she had the nerve to insinuate that I have used her son to do what I have, and it pissed me off so much. And I got to thinking about my life since I left for the military. 
I didn't have a drivers lisence and therefore no car. I changed that on my own. I got my license and purchased my first car shortly after. I got my AA with the tuition benefits I recieved from serving in the military. Yes my husband has helped me build a fabulous life, but I served my time in the military and I earned my AA on my own. We bought our first house together last year. But as I stated above, my husband is deployed and even if he isnt over seas, he is constantly gone elsewhere. I have had to pay bills on my own, clean the house, take care of our dogs, and grocery shop and maintain my grades in my classes, which I did. I cannot rely on my husband due to his commitment with the military but that's ok. I'm also the only one of my moms 7 kids who has never had to move back in with her after high school and the only one (who can have kids) who doesn't have kids. 
Im not 100% happy and OK but I am getting there. I still struggle and I still have to fight to get out of bed sometimes. But I'm doing it. And I'm doing it (somewhat) on my own. My husband cheers me on and encourages me even if hes not physically with me. It's taken a long while for me to realize how wonderful he is and has been these past 9 years together and he pushed me to start therapy. 
But I want to say this: if I can fight and keep fighting, so can you. You can do this. WE can do this. Together we can fight to see the next day and work on us.
I'm doing OK and that's OK.

depression,"I guess I’ll start a couple years ago. I’ve always been a little more moody and irritable and sadder than most people as far as I could tell, but it wasn’t until just a couple years ago I started to realize it might be depression and not just edgy teenager shit. In November 2018 I broke up with my girlfriend (my choice) and ended up getting a crush on a new girl. January 2019 I became officially radicalized and became an anarchist-communist, which woke up something else in me. I realized just how shitty the whole world it is and I just became increasingly depressed. Around May and June I started visiting a therapist for anxiety and “”minor”” depression, and my crush and I began talking. She then lost interest in me, I started stressing about college coming up, and I got a super shitty part-time job, which all culminated in me being super suicidal. I went so far as to go to Bass Pro to try and buy a gun, but I chickened out. Told my therapist, then had to tell my dad, and I got hospitalized more or less voluntarily for a week. I was feeling good when I first got out, but it’s gone downhill since then. Luckily in the fall I met another girl in my class, we’ve been dating since January and I love her so much and she’s definitely been helping more than I could ever say. Even still, I’ve become more and more depressed and outright suicidal. I know exactly how I want to kill myself but I can’t ever get the courage up to do it. I still want to live, at least partially, I just wish I was someone else in a different world. I’m an incredibly shitty person and I wish people would finally realize I’m not worth loving, even though I love feeling loved. I know I don’t deserve their love. I’ve always had a super irrational phobia of both veins and alcohol, blood and drugs, etc. And yet as I’ve grown more suicidal, most of my fantasies now involve me getting drunk and driving off a bridge, slitting my wrists, shooting myself in the head, overdosing on medicine, hanging myself, just getting high and drunk as shit so I can finally get the courage to finally fucking kill myself. I just want to be dead, but I don’t think I do. I want to be happy but I feel like I can’t, so I’d rather be dead than depressed. And I upset my girlfriend tonight and she doesn’t want to talk to me (it’s only been a couple hours but I’m incredibly sensitive to all kinds of pushback and I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for hurting her), and I wish I could just cry to let it out, and I wish I could tell my therapist or psychiatrist or girlfriend or dad or someone what I’m going through without hurting them and without being hospitalized again. I just want to not be here, not like this, and there’s nothing I can do. I’m so lost.

depression,"First of all sorry for the weird title but I couldn't sum it up better.

So I noticed the last few weeks that my depression has gotten better, to a point I want to meet friends and generally get out of the house more.

I'm also medicated and in therapy which kinda helps, I guess.

but more baffling to me is how I can accept my depression now.

For years and until recently I would call myself out for *faking* my depression to get attention.

despite seeking professional help a few months ago and my therapist making it very clear that, in fact, I have major depression I still would struggle with those thoughts on a daily basis.

My new mantra is, I'm not thinking I'm faking it to get attention anymore,

instead my new thought process is more something like this ""You are a depressive, manipulative asshole that uses his illness to get the attention he needs"".

I only noticed this a few hours ago and it really confuses me, like am I actually accepting that I'm depressed? 

Or Have I faked it so long that I believe it myself now?

I guess if it is the former I could call that progress? 

However If it's the latter I'm just running in circles and will end up in that repeating cycle of self-loathing mantras.

depression,"1. It’s okay to feel bad and to cry it all out. Take the time to let yourself feel the emotions instead of bottling them away. I might feel this way for awhile and I might want to cry for so long but I know one day I’ll wake up and it’ll be enough. I’ll be able to move on and be strong. 
2. Use the people who want to support you in life. This seems like such an easy one but for me I never brought up my issues to anyone because I didn’t want to be a bother to them. But I’ve seen how that just makes me drive people away because I get resentful and in my own mind, when in reality I’m the one not trying harder to communicate how I feel because it’s hard.
3. Things happen. All the cards can be played right but it still doesn’t pan out to what you want it to be. It absolutely sucks and I can’t do anything about it. I gave it my all for so long and it feels like I’ve been betrayed. But I know that life is weird and full of twists and turns and everyone gets lost for a bit, they just need time to find their way out of this maze, just like me.
4. It wasn’t your fault. It toke me so long (I still feel this way honestly I’m working on this more) to realize that everyone has their own perspective on the everts in their life and it doesn’t mean that you weren’t good enough, or attractive enough, or smart enough or whatever. It just means that life works in weird ways and it wasn’t meant to be. You can still grow and cherish these experiences, because they make you who you are now. 
5. Give the world some love. I didn’t know it but after I finally talked to my friends about issues I have, they all said I was a very special person to them and that I would do great things in life. I’ve never believed it myself, it’s so hard to want to believe in yourself when everything is falling apart. But I guess I still gave my authentic self to people I cared about and in turn they saw who I was as a person. Sometimes it’s just nice to be nice to strangers or friends. Maybe they need a little encouragement and in the end you both feel better for it.

depression,"I just want to start off with some background. I've made posts here before on a different account at a different stage in my life, and this stage is...Sickining-ly similar. I have been dealing with depression for almost a year now because it seems like no matter what, everyone/thing I love dies. I say too familiar with cancer and what it does. I've lost 2 aunts (both of which I loved dearly) to cancer, 2 uncles (1 I loved like a father, one I didn't know very well) to cancer, one uncle to murder, (Culprit never caught), I lost my mother at 4 years old during surgery after a car accident, (Drunk driver. Never caught.) And my dad was in prison for the first 6 years of my life. He currently lives in a different state. We don't talk much. I live with my grandparents, and as much as I hate to say it, they're not doing too well. After my mother's death, my dad took time to cope. At this point he was still in prison. When I was 10, he met a girl named Sarah, and they got engaged. I found out he and her came to visit us. For the first time in a long time I thought we could be happy. Be a family. 2 months later they divorced after she cheated on him. That's some backstory, I could tell you way more but I'll spare you the details. Every time I close my eyes at night, I see them. All of the loved ones I've lost. At the immediate sight of my mother, I tear up. It's at the point where I'm intentionally sleep-starving myself so I don't feel like I want to kill myself. Being honest, I probably would have if it hadn't been for the birth of my half sister on 15/1/20. My father is currently in a relationship with another woman. I recently received the news that I'll have another sibling in about 8 months. I know the pain of loss all too well, and I could never put my family through that.",I'm exhausted.,t3_gtcc7o,0

depression,"Between the riots, the horrific  brutal and sad murder that preceded it, the covid-19 deaths, our insane president, the continued ping-ponging between ideologues of both sides acting increasingly crazy, and the media but seems intent on exacerbating it all: the end result is I can't even concentrate today. It feels like our country is faced right now with half a dozen or more catastrophic problems that we are failing to successfully overcome, we're not even succeeding at treading water it seems like. and it feels like there's a lot of people who are nihilistic and in fact want to see us delve further into chaos and violence and hatred, who are intentionally exacerbating the problems and fueling the fire, trying to further escalate the chaos and hatred. I feel overwhelmed with the negativity that seems to permeate the air. Is there anybody else in the same boat? you don't have to go into detail or elaborate it's just nice to know I'm not the only one who is preoccupied with it all to the point that trying to pull myself away from it and move my attention elsewhere has not worked so far.",Are you feeling it?,t3_gt1g4m,0

depression,"I’ve been suicidal since I was a child. My life has been a roller coaster of bullshit and unfortunate events. My family is a nutcase circus show, I’ve been abused, I’ve lived through poverty, I’ve been beaten, molested, lied to, played, taken advantage of, my own father stole money from me. So did my own mother. I had to shoot my own dog in the head when I was 14. I had no friends, none aside from 1... he is still my best friend. I binged drugs non stop for 3 years straight, and just for the cherry on top GOD STRUCK ME DOWN WITH TYPE 1 FUCKING DIABETES AT AGE 17. Every family memory I have is bad, every friend memory I’ve had was while high on various substances. My one and only girlfriend left me because she was “bored” and was cheating the whole time. The last time I cried was huge. It was the last time I genuinely felt something really.. really good. It was the day I ended my drug addiction. Cried for hours but the feeling was really good... I haven’t felt pleasure since, even orgasms don’t feel good anymore. I just work, and smoke weed. The weed helps.. it really fucking does. Life is just always boring and I just wanna lay in bed all day. Nothing is fun, nothing is good. I just live my life day to day... not even feeling sad anymore just bored and discontent. This isn’t a post asking for help... because I don’t need it. Life keeps moving and I AM GOING to get better. I don’t have any secrets to living with depression. I don’t have any special way of continuing the journey. I just do it. It’s the only way. Depression doesn’t just go away because you want it to. It goes away when your heart is in a good place. I’ve lived like this since childhood, teenage years where hell and that’s when the drugs went hard. The only feeling on this planet I crave is physical affection.. I’ve only felt it once. From my ex girlfriend, aside from her... I’ve never been shown affection in my life. I dropped pills the second I felt that high... it matched the feeling of warmth and oxytocin that I soooo craved. That I am not strong enough to use... it will take me away quickly. I just live, don’t survive but live. Don’t lay in bed, get up and do shit. Don’t sit there thinking negatively, doesn’t mean give yourself narcissistic thoughts of bullshit but just keep distracted. The only way to beat depression is to live with it. Eventually it fades. Life is a long time, I promise to all of you depression goes away. Trust me, I’ve been through so much you couldn’t imagine some of my memories. Besides, you can never feel joy if you haven’t felt pain. Keep pushing to all you ppl who are under a lot of emotional torment. Depression is tiny compared to you. Don’t let an emotion own you... your mind is a powerful place and what you feed it makes powerful change. Life keeps moving and so must you",I’ve been sad for so long I’m not even suicidal anymore..

depression,"Every day seems like a struggle. You’re right. Everything seems hard and everything seems pointless and impossible. After all, every day I think to myself why? We are all going to die anyway. No one will remember us. We just turn into bones and are buried underground. I try to help people okay, this is why I want to be a psychologist. But maybe all my friends are right. Love is a lie. A pretty lie we want to believe to stop feeling lonely in our lives, to stop feeling in the pit of sadness that some of us feel most of the day. We need a distraction and maybe we fake happiness in order to do this but either way, I can't fake it anymore. I can't pretend like anything will cheer me up when all of this has happened. I hate arguments. I hate drama. I hate stress. Most days I feel unbelievable guilt over stupid things, over people being childish and not understanding things. You tell me you love me. But how can you possibly tell me that? You don't know me. The things you think of me are the only things you want to believe, I'm the figure you hope to find in the future. Soon then you will realise but until then you want me to hurt over and over because of all of you loving me and then to tell me it's my fault. I never wanted any of this to happen. I never wanted to be at fault for anything, I just wanted to be happy. I wanted to have fun in quarantine and I wanted to try to smile for once in a while but all that happens is I seem to feel sadder and sadder each day. But no one understands, no one believes me, or I'm being dramatic. Probably all three of those things. But I can't keep pretending like this isn't hurting me, it isn't affecting me because it's all I think about. All I do is hurt people, and they blame me, then they don't. I deserve the pain, I deserve the hate, I deserve to be shouted at. Why is everything so easy for everyone else? The things I feel are over dumb shit that won't matter in a year so why do I feel all of this suddenly now? And why is it only me? It feels like whatever is making me feel like this all together is a mask, or a dark fog clouding over me. It's consuming me, but its nothing. I hear all these stories of people's lives, of all of your lives, and it is so much worse than I could possibly imagine. You are all strong people but I am not. I feel stupid to even be thinking like this, I don't deserve it when you have gone through so much worse. My pain is pathetic. I am pathetic. Why am I sad and stressed over such stupid things? Why do I overreact to everything? I wish I didn't care. I wish I was heartless. Some say that is the greatest personality trait but no it's not. It makes me feel guilty. Overwhelming guilt, it feels as if I've killed all of you, all your emotions are dying because of me, and because of everything, I do. My actions seem to be like murder to your mind. I'm sorry for hurting any of you emotionally. None of you deserved it, you all deserve someone who isn't like me. Someone who doesn't randomly feel like the world is against them. But I just feel like that's what I deserve. I don't deserve love, I don't deserve anything. Yet I complain about not having everything like money all the time too.

depression,"I’m 14 and I think I’ve developed bipolar depression. My dad has always been bipolar and he also verbally abused me a lot. Websites say that it can be caused by abuse, trauma, family genes, and stress. Recently I have been really stressed with school so that might be the cause along with my past. Soccer is my dream but now I feel I’ve lost all my feelings for it, I also lost my feelings to be successful and lost all my motivation. I feel trapped, like I’m such in a deep state I can’t get out. Sometimes I want to die and all I feel is nothing. When I see websites I fit every description on the depression side of bipolar depression.

my brain doesn't function properly anymore as brain fog has swallowed me whole. I cannot think worth a damn and I feel as though my mind and my body are disconnected entirely. I mentally black out as i say and do stupid shit only for my conscoiusness to snap back into place after the fact to live with the consequences. I feel like I'm making excuses and that's because I am, but thats truly how it feels day in and day out. particularly with my boyfriend.

my brain fog has frustrated him the most besides myself. I am in a constant state of zoned out and he constantly has to reel me back into reality to save me from shit as serious as crashing my car or as mundane as running into people on the sidewalk. I also constantly don't think before I open my fucking mouth and as a result say hurtful things when I'm mad at him or say just stupid shit in general and embarrass myself. 

it doesn't help that I have a massive guilt complex that stems from childhood. he has gotten more and more frustrated that I cry every time we argue, so he's stopped arguing and just let me approach him when i calm down. but I can't calm down because while he's on his computer mildly pissed at me I'm destroying myself in our bedroom mentally screaming about how much of a massive piece of self sabotaging shit I am and how much I hate myself and how I need to hurt myself because I don't deserve skin I don't deserve muscles I don't deserve anything because I keep making these dumb decisions and I'm terrified that I'm ruining his life and making him feel the way I feel. obviously I'm not and he doesn't but in the moment it feels that way.


all of this is amplified to be 100x worse with this fucking quarantine going on we've been fighting so much because I'm stressed out all the goddamn time with everything going on and I keep unintentionally taking it out on him because I have no one or nothing else to take it out on. its truly driving us apart and I'm so heartbroken and consumed with guilt.

Dear xxxx, 

I really wanted to help you. I'm not sure what exactly I'd help with, but I think the desire came from me wanting to turn you into the idealized version I had. I don't understand exactly what I had in mind, the only thing that makes sense to me is making you into someone who made me happy. This was selfish of me, I'm sorry for that. I know I have been difficult to deal with, I've made a lot of mistakes. I'd be distant everytime you dissapointed me. I can't blame you, you never promised me anything, it was all expectations I thought you'd accomplish.  Over the time I've spent getting to know you, I've discovered you're an internalized racist, annoyed when anyone other than you expresses discomfort in their life. You lack compassion, you don't try and help anyone unless it benefits you. I messed up, I regret meeting you. My life would be so much easier without you, I know it's a selfish thing to say, but frankly, you most likely feel the same way, and I understand. I know this sounds like it is meant to talk shit to you, maybe it is all this is, but man, you really make my life difficult. I don't know what to do, I don't like you, I wish you weren't in my life. In my eyes, you're pathetic. I hate seeing you, the fact that your only goal in life is to have a woman to fuck and to appear masculine is pathetic. You're not masculine, you're the prime example of a fucking waste of space. No amount of height and dick size will ever compensate for the worst personality. I'm not sure if I loved you, I might've, or I might've just been bored, lonely? I know, I myself am a shitty person and I've written multiple of these letters to myself, I'm not justifying the person I am. Even so, I still feel a need to write this to you. If I think about it, I did feel love towards you, I'm not sure why it was there in the first place. You didn't offer much to me, I can't say you even made me happier than I was. If anything you robbed me of any happiness and self respect I had. It was my mistake to get involved, I'm sorry for dragging you into my life. It's going to get a bit gross, but this is my letter, so whatever. Sometimes I feel like vomiting when I think of you. I think of the way you used to touch me and the awful kisses you gave me. Your tongue, it tasted awful, I just didn't know how to say it. To be honest, I'm pretty sure mine was probably bad too, I don't know, but you seemed so eager to taste it all the time, it's hard to say. I'm disgusted, I don't know why. I know people do that stuff all the time. I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to be intimate. I didn't want to share my body with anyone else. You groped me and I couldn't say no. You saw me naked and I couldnt say no. I don't think I'll ever get that back, the feeling of being in control. I said many things to please you, I asked for things I didn't want because I knew you wanted to give them to me. I can't believe I practically made my life purpose at the time to serve you, to make you happy, but even then I dont think it worked. I can't blame you, no, I don't blame you. I put this on myself, I just wish I never met you. Most of this is my fault. I approached you, I talked to you, maybe I was lonely, I just wanted to help you be a better person, I guess. I still dont know why. I'd like to take this as a learning experience, but what did I learn? I dont think I've gained anything positive from the experience we've gained together. I'm sorry, I really am. At night I pray to God that he forgive me. I know I messed up, meeting you, getting to know you. I pray he give me peace of mind, no more resentment. I don't hate you, xxxx, I just wish I never met you. You look up to these idols, these masculine figures, wishing you could be them, flaunting your looks, claiming to be handsome.

It's pathetic, you excercise for the praise, you don't care about your body. You don't care about your health. Playing sports was never about being healthy, it was about the image. You wanted people to think of you a certain way, it's the only reason you bothered to play sports. I'm sorry you were made to feel that way, that people will only care about you if you can pass a ball around. You make me upset, I agree, this letter is very shitty and hateful, I just can't help myself, that's how you made me feel towards myself. You used me for my body, you claimed you loved me so you could use me as your status. I lost most of my friends because they couldn't believe I'd date someone like you. I thank you for that though, I figured theyre toxic friends anyways, but I should've seen it. People don't like you. I ignored them because I claimed I was in love. I dont know if I was in love, all the emotions I have towards you are ruined. I will never be able to comprehend them. I can't sleep at night because of you. I don't want to wake up every 2 hours because I see you in my dreams. It's been more than 2 months since I've seen you and it's still hard to deal with just the idea of you.

I was constantly picking my nails cause I was always nervous and stressed. I was so lonely all the time. My grades were shit. I never really did any homework or anything. I felt like shit, but I never told my parents. I lied to them about having friends and being happy.

During 6th grade I had a few more friends which made it a better year. I had people I could talk to. The problem in 6th grade though, was that I had gained A LOT of weight, and I hated how I looked. I got glasses that year too, which didn’t really make anything better. My grades were slightly better, but still bad. I rarely studied, and I almost failed math class. I had no motivation during this time, and I even talked to my mentor about it. Or maybe she talked to me (I think so). I didn’t have any confidence, and I really hated how I looked during 6th grade.

7th grade started out good, I had a lot of friends which made me like school a bit more. I had started to lose some weight, since I was fat. This then quickly turned into an ED and all I thought about was food and exercise. I don’t really know why it went like this, I guess it was because some stuff went wrong before this. 

There was a guy who I had a crush on during the summer (we both kinda liked each other, but it never became a thing). One night my friend told me she apparently liked him too now. This made me have a panic attack in my room (then bathroom floor) at 2 am, cause I still wasn’t over him even though I told her I was :) 

Another one of my friends also found out she had a tumor in her leg, but it wasn’t dangerous. It still scared me a bit though. 

Anyways, I went to a ward (I don’t really know what to call it) for my ED in the end of February, and I missed the last term of school. It really lowered my grades, and I felt so worthless. I had gotten decent grades during the first term, and school was actually going okay for the first time ever. But that didn’t really work out.

Last year I started 8th grade. I had one friend in the beginning, and then made 2 new. One of them ended up switching schools though, so that was kinda sad. Everything was going okay, but I was a bit behind in school. I still did okay though (trying to be positive). My mental health started declining again during the winter though. I was having suicidal thoughts almost every day, and I felt so fucking worthless (still kinda do if I’m being honest). 

It went away when the spring arrived, but that was when my obsessive and compulsive behavior began to escalate. I’ve had it (but only mildly) during every winter since 4th grade, and it’s gotten progressively worse each year. This year it kinda escalated, and I can’t really stop now. But, I’m seeing a psychologist in June, so I hope I can start taking medication. 

TL;DR:
Anyways, I’ve never had any motivation to do anything in school during these years. I’ve never been the one to start a conversation with anyone, I haven’t had the motivation to do it. I don’t see a purpose in doing anything, and it’s been like this for years. Why should I sleep if I don’t feel like there’s a reason to wake up for school? Why should I study if I’m just going to disappear one day?

depression,"I've always been insecure about my looks, especially my the shape of my nose. The anterior angle of my nose is an instant downward slope, and this is accompanied by a deviated septum and sometimes a physically painful feeling in my nose which just makes the whole ordeal all the more painful, emotionally and physical, also I sometimes have trouble breathing sometimes through my nose, oh and did I also mention that I have Chronic Rhinitis (Nasal Discharge) that makes it crippling for me to exist in social situations without looking stupid.

All of this is very overwhelming, it's been a let down for me in the past but recently it has gotten more to me and it absolutely just makes me wanna put a bullet in my brain for good.

The confusing and painful thing is I've never seen anyone with my nose profile ever, which probably explains why I feel like an alien all the time, like I don't belong. Maybe if I had an ugly nose that someone out there in the world had I would feel a little better that I'm not alone, but no I had to have been born with the most unique and ugly nose. (I don't have the biggest nose in the world it's kinda medium sized but still ugly looking).

I'd say I def have Body Dysmorphia, but if I remember correctly BDD is only for people who think that they're ugly when they're NOT.

And the thing is as well when I smile (the most humane thing a person can do that costs literally nothing), my nose takes a very ugly (more so than it is) shape because it moves down with my mouth as there is no support from the anterior angle.

Even the least good-looking person out there probably has a normal looking nose, unlike me.

Surgery or septoplasty are definitely out of the question as I literally have no money and it's very expensive where I live especially, and since my parents divorced from a very long and miserable marriage and I live with my mother, it's become even more out of the question (also I should mention that my father doesn't pay for our expenses anymore as well, and my mother is a stay-at-home).

I never had friends, never had any meaningful relationship or connection with anyone ever growing up, might have been of my ugliness or maybe it was my social anxiety or was it the lack of energy to make friends? Who knows..

I have been crying to sleep every night, I cry a lot even during the day and I'm just so so tired from this life and I wanna finally get a relief.

depression,"I'm currently 18 years old, so I feel as if I may be going through teenage emotions but it feels much larger than that. I'm a male so I feel that I'm not as prone to emotions as a female, even though I take after my mother much more than father. Honestly maybe I just feel the need to ramble.

I'm a normal kid, I have always got a long with everyone and I can talk to anybody. I can be apart of any crowd now problem, but I can never feel 100% emotionally connected. As I have grown up I've became the person people come to in my family for advice, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. I always do what I can but that puts a huge weight on my shoulders. It all started mainly when my parents were struggling with addiction back and forth and I was the one to finally step up and do something about it. Long story short I struggled with that for a couple years but now everything has calmed down and went somewhat back to normal. Lately, this has what made me realize I don't feel ""normal"". I don't feel sad or depressed (all the time) and I've seen therapists. I just always feel numb. I had two family members die in the same month and never felt to urge to even cry. It somewhat scares me because I feel like I have no sense of emotions and don't feel happy, sad, or any other emotions about the things I should.

Because of this, I think they've cared less about how I feel or maybe they think I am a strong person when in fact I have a vulnerable side wanting my life to end. 

Today, my family was in the livingroom watching TV. I went downstairs to get something. My mom's a neat freak and we're required to wear slippers downstairs.

depression,"Even though I keep my life in pretty good order, I eat healthy, I sleep regular, I have a job, take classes, have goals, have hobbies... I'm cynical about life. 

I dont have a religion and so i know life only has the meaning you give to it, but I cant give it any meaning that makes me happy. If I try living in the moment, every, single, fucking, time, I WILL fall back on old habits. I will stop taking care of myself, I will eat poorly, experiment with drugs, break things out of anger. 

I cant indulge any hedonistic pleasure because it just puts me on the path of self destruction. In other people's eyes I'm doing great right now. Like I said, i have my shit together, and i can use my willpower (though it takes all of it) to just keep marching forward but nothing in my goals makes me happy. 

Music used to make me happy, i was even a music major for a while. I still practice but feel nothing, I listen to my old favorites and explore for new stuff and it just all starts to sound the same. 

Never had sex or a girlfriend but every girl I meet is a psycho and manipulative or so needy that shes not worth my time. Sex doesnt seem any more enticing than masturbation, which I also limit and RARELY do with the help of pornography - once again I will become addicted and have quit. 

It doesnt matter that I can take care of myself and be a ""healthy person"". Life has no meaning and I dont enjoy it. It's a bother to socialize with people and listen to their problems but i do it, and i offer help and follow through. People help me and it honestly only makes me feel guilt because I know they must deeply care about me but I just force myself to because I dont want to fall into a recluse state. 

The only times I feel happy are when I say fuck it and go drink a 15 pack of beer and chain smoke cigarettes. This will put me on a few week long downward spiral where I start to lose grip of things, then I have to reschedule my shit and resummon my willpower. And in the end was it worth it? Just to get fucked up and make a fool of myself. 

It feels like it is worth it though when I look at my potential future and cant visualize anything that would satisfy me. Not even if I could fly or shoot lazer beams from my fingertips would I feel happy. No girl could ever satisfy me, no friendship could distract me from our inevitable demise. Fixing the suffering of mankind would increase other's opinions of me, but not my own. 

I've slowly been improving myself to be ""healthy"" but I honestly miss the old me from 5 or 6 years ago, the drug addict who felt EVERYTHING and fought for causes because he believed in the end it all meant something.

Heart-wrenching grief, soul-searing pain ripping at the very seams of my being, solitary confinement with rules that cannot be bent. A spiralling rut that I won't ever escape, for it makes me forget who I am. With each day that passes the color in my eyes fades into dull decay. Bound to chains, chained to hate, locked in place. Hopeless and powerless in the face of my conscious' deepest and darkest pits. Shadows cast across the floor, reflections of the past amidst the tears.

That was fine in and of itself, but after like 4 days I started having these scary upper body seizure type things that scared the shit out of me. I texted him after another 4 days of these seizure things and told him and he still wanted me to stay at 40mg with no explanation, but I dropped it down for 30mg anyways because I was terrified. No more seizure things thankfully. I feel like he doesn't care about my well-being.

Also, it's not like I'm a suicide risk or anything. I still struggle of course, who doesn't, but it's not like taking 30mg instead of 40mg is a big risk to my mental health, I'm managing at 30mg just fine.

depression,"Disclaimer: this will probably seem like a sap story, but I'm seriously here to vent and to get some support. Please don't hate, I'm on the edge rn. 

Not going to say my exact age, but high teens. Female. 

So I have been struggling with mental health for as long as I can remember, but it really started about a year ago. 

Some backstory and explanation so things make sense:

My father passes in 2015, therefore I lived with my sister and mom. I took the death in a negative way, and spent my time alone and got really depressed. Then I started to get trust issues with my family cause they were taking it so well and I wasn't (was pretty selfish of me). Therefore, I wouldn't really talk to my family. In about 2018, I stopped talking to them all together, and I would only vent/ talk about my emotions and how I was feeling to my close friends. I started doing that for about a year. In about 2017, my mom got a boyfriend. Me and my sister were forced to go their place every night; and lets just say that we don't get along too well. Well, in about the mid 2017, I wasn't feeling great mentally, and I stayed in bed for about an extra hour and a half. They tried to get me out of bed to look at a fox, but I refused, and apparently that was disrespectful. I told my mom's boyfriend that I was feeling extra depressed that day, but he kicked me out for a while. I was ""just being lazy"", and ""looking for attention"". To this day, I don't think he believes in mental illnesses. After I moved the the boyfriend's house, my mom and boyfriend get their own place, me and me sister got our own place. Both on the same property. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where things start to get wild: 

After staying at my mom's place after I was kicked out, despite my protests I was forced to go back to my mom's boyfriend's place because it turns out that we were moving there. Oh, boy. It was going generally fine, as I was mostly avoiding him, but after he shot the family dog for running away, I kinda cracked. I really shouldn't have as I knew what would come of it. I still feel shitty about this but I still think I did the right thing here. I tried to tell them that what they did was wrong, and that it really scared me. Then I got real pissed and shut myself in my room for a few days. Remember how I would only ever talk to me friends about my emotions? Well I did that. That's something that I truly regret, and is probably the reason why I've tried to kill myself so many times. Here's why. 

My mom's boyfriend took my phone during that protest, cause I stupidly left it lying around. After looking through it, he found my support group chat and read everything. I was dragged into an angry confrontation. There's a lot that happened, but here is the basic rundown. 

In about an hour into it, I think I started developing selective mutism. This means that whenever I'm really anxious, I freeze and I am physically unable to speak. 

I was told I was an attention whore. That I only keep my friends by ""making up stories"" to make them pity me. That I'm malicious, abusive, and and psychopath. 

Was told that the only thing I will ever succeed in will be lying to the people I love. 

And that anything other than the truth is unacceptable, and I would have to tell them about everything I am feeling. 

So, I did just that. I told them that I was suicidal. And I told them why. BIGGEST MISTAKE. 

I was thrown out of the house to word ""abusive"" being yelled over and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I was watching everyone else on the property have fun and grow bonds while I couldn't leave my house. This continued until I left for 6 weeks for cadet camp (summer of 2018). I came back, and was devastated at what I came back too. I come back, and no one even looks at me. Not even my sister. I say hi, and it goes ignored. I have been gone for a month and a half and this is what I come back to? I work my ass off doing an advanced course with the military and this is my congratulations? I get a medal for being the top cadet and I don't even get recognized my my own damn family? This broke me a little bit. 

So I was alone in my room for the rest of my summer. With half of the stuff I own going missing while I was gone, It went by slowly. 

After that, about once a week someone would try to talk to me. But I couldn't talk. That select mutism wouldn't let me. And I couldn't tell them that I even had this because I couldn't physically. Each time they talked to me, I was scared that something worse would happen to me, and I couldn't see them without my anxiety rocketing. In January this year they started threatening me because I wouldn't say anything. I started at simple punishments but have escalated to being threatened of being thrown out, the things I use for coping being thrown in our wood stove, and my contact with my friends being severed. 

Today was probably one of the last times I am going to be confronted. All of my communication with anyone not on my property has been cut off. I haven't vented to anyone since that initial talk about it. Tomorrow, wifi is going to be turned off and I won't be able to talk to anyone. I've tried to kill myself multiple times, but I think this is where it ends. I won't be able to stop myself this time. Today's talk really hit me hard this time. 

If I'm going to go out, I at least want other people to know what I went through and why emotional abuse is not a joke. Parents, if you see your child with signs of severe anxiety, depression, or mental illness(s), please help them. Emotional abuse will probably end my life. Stay safe out there. &lt;3

Pandemic aside, my world is getting so small. My entire life is made up of playing the same 10 or so video games, and listening to the same 5 bands over and over and over again. The only thing in my life that has not become disappointing as I age is eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's getting worse too. Now not only am I restricted to these games and artists, but I'm becoming more seasonal as I get older, so now I can only play certain things at certain times of the year. I'm stuck on a certain game series because it's the ""right"" time of year to play it. I'm desperate to move on, but playing anything else right now would feel wrong and cause me to go dissociative. Same with music, I can only listen to one band right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't discover anything new. I try, but I've just developed this revulsion to new things, and I'm becoming this cynical, bitter person that I despise. I'll try to go and discover some new music, but I'll end up stuck listening to a different band I've maybe not listened to in a while, but have already played to death anyway.

So now I'm just beating the corpses of the same few games over and over and over again until I hate them too.

The past many years seem to be based on a particular pattern I had for about 2 or 3 years, when I was basically a full NEET. I was a borderline alcoholic, I cried constantly, and I felt sick and miserable all the time. Back then, my days consisted solely of playing whatever games I liked that came to mind, waiting for my parents to go to bed before going downstairs and watching TV for a while before going to bed and waking up late afternoon. The result was, I basically played this kind of rotation of games and music, the same 5-10 throughout those couple years - and every year since has been based on those few terrible years.

depression,"I'm 21 (F) and I've been struggling with mental illness for 6 years now. I've been in and out of hospitals (I've been inpatient twice and partially hospitalized twice) and have tried so many medications, a lot with bad side effects (seizures, complete lack of appetite to the point where I developed an eating disorder, hallucinations, etc.). Still haven't found a med that really works for me, except for Adderall which helps sometimes.

No one's ever been able to quite figure out what I have diagnosis-wise, I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I definitely have that, but other than that it's been suggested to me that I have type II bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, OCD, complex PTSD, etc. My present therapist has me down for bipolar, which seems to fit but as a lot of you guys know, isn't set in stone. I know that diagnoses are nebulous and the definitions blend together a lot of the time, especially when ADHD is involved, but I really wish I had a label w/ which to name this thing is I'm dealing with.

Anyway, I just graduated from college, and I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I've been so bad motivation-wise bc I've been so depressed. I've literally only applied to one job in the last two weeks and every time I try to apply for something I just can't. I think a big part of it is that I really didn't think I'd make it to graduating college alive, and there's a big part of me that just can't handle this level of sickness anymore. If my depressive periods keep coming back and I have to keep suffering through them, is there a reason to keep living? I feel so messed up at this point that it feels like I'm just putting myself and my family through more pain. 

Two days ago I took the entire bottle of my anti-anxiety medication in one go in the hope that maybe I'd be sent to the hospital or something (I wasn't really thinking, just wanted the pain to stop). Nothing happened, literally just felt a little drifty for the rest of the night. I have a big stored-up pile of meds from failed medications that I tried, don't know exactly what they'll do but I think they would do the job good enough. 

I'm just so tired of the pain. Every day existing on just feels like a mighty labor, like I'm Sisyphus pushing my boulder up a hill just for it to roll down and for me to start again. I'm not really particularly good at anything nor do I have any real interests, I've spent my entire teenage and young adulthood so far just trying to fight this thing.

When I was 14 I became suicidal and tried to commit suicide several times, my worst attempt was when I was 18, which was a turning point and started a journey of healing, failure falling back into depression, getting back in tracks, getting my life together, failing again etc... It took me 12 years to learn to like myself and three more to live the life I always wanted. I am finally genuinely happy. 
I went trough this without therapie and without guidance or someone who understood.

I have a  brother (35)
He was always ashamed of me, because I was weak, as he would've said that. He told me to just suck it up and get my life together. He told me, I was just lazy.  We were never close, and all these years I saw him maybe once or twice a year, but I loved him nontheless.
A year ago he and his girlfriend of 10years broke up. And it hit him real hard. Since then we saw each other pretty often. He and my husband are on good terms, so he comes for dinner almost weekly and our relationship improved aswell. 

Yesterday he told me, He got depressions. I knew it since before Christmas. I knew it because I saw the signs I am way too familiar with. That's why I made sure to call him once a week to come for dinner. I didn't want to talk to him about it before he was comfortable to talk to me first. 
I really want to support him, I don't want him to go through the same like I did and I don't want him to feel, how I felt.

The first thing I told him was, that it's nothing to take lightly and it's not a weakness. I told him that I love him and that he could talk to me whenever he likes.

depression,"This is a throwaway. I’m an early teenager in late middle school. I started feeling shitty about myself at the beginning of 7th grade. I think it’s because the summer before it, my parents had a huge fight at Disney world(Ironic right?). My mom was screaming about getting a divorce and me and my brother were crying. Ever since then, once in a while my parents would have a fight (luckily, none physical just verbal). I’ve gotten used to them. I feel like I cause the fights indirectly because I always do a little thing that sets the fight in motion. (Example: I ask to get/do something, my parents disagree and get into a loud verbal fight, the fight topic goes to something else). I do a bunch of stupid shit at school, and I feel like my parents are severely disappointed in me every time they find out. I feel tired all the time, I don’t want to do anything but play games. I constantly think to the shitty things I did and how I’m just a burden to my parents. I hate how I look in the mirror.

depression,"This might be a little long, if you read: cool, if you don't: cool. (No TL;DR) Also this post isn't a joke of any kind, I'm being pretty serious just FYI

It's somewhat strange exactly what I'm addicted to and I'm not even sure how common the addiction is. So I'm writing it out here to just type something out/use this as journal, work out what I'm going through by writing it down and see if anybody else is going through the same thing

So: I'm addicted to feeling depressed. More specifically heartbreak. It's a little complicated, but I'll try to simplify with a little backstory.

So cliche, but I've always been rejected when it comes to romantic relationships/are always unrequited. I've never been in a relationship because of it and I keep getting more cynical each time I realize I have a new crush. I immediately shut my feelings down and wait it out until said feelings are gone. Not a healthy way to do it, but it's effective, keeps me guarded and keeps the bar low. Anyways, romance and unrequited love turns out to be my favorite genre(s) when reading webcomics/manga or watch movies, etc. I never realized that I absolutely revel in the romantic endeavors in each story like that. When the fictional relationship goes well, I feel sad and think ""that'll never happen to me"" and get heartbroken. And when they go sour or they have unresolved/unrequited feeling for a person in story, I think ""I know how you feel"" and get heartbroken all the same (Just for clarification however, when heartbreak is happening to me in real life for a real crush, etc, I don't revel in it. I know, complicated blah blah) 

The thing is, though, I never realized that I had always been practically *actively* searching for things to read/watch that give me that feeling of heartbreak and keeping myself in that kind of state deliberately. It's almost like I feel as though I don't deserve that kind of happiness  one gets from romantic relationships. I love my friends and family and they love me, those relationships I have there are solid and good, but romance is a different category.

Tiny story within the story that kind of relates: I *almost* got into a romantic relationship with someone. I told them how I felt because my roommate was egging me on and encouraging me. They said they felt the same and the relationship felt like it was about to start, which was a *great* feeling. I could feel the doors finally opening to let me in, it was going to be my first ever relationship! But then I felt the *strongest* gut feeling I've *ever* felt in my life: ""This is wrong."" My head and heart kept *screaming* this at me *the* moment the relationship was established. It was so weird! At that moment, once I felt the gut feeling, it took over my entire body and mind. *Any* attraction/feelings I had felt for this person seconds before were *immediately* diminished, and I mean immediately. They were just gone, and the gut feeling had taken over everything that was left. ""This is wrong"" ""This isn't right"" ""You have to get out of this now"" It's like my fight or flight switch had been jammed to flight and was stuck for some reason. Unfortunately, I knew I couldn't lead this person on and I knew it would hurt me even more if I continued, so after only a day and a half I called it off. (It was mutual, so don't worry) Straight after calling it off, I relaxed so heavily. I didn't even feel any heartbreak, just relief, like I had been carrying a five year long weight on my shoulders for just that short amount of time. I have *no idea* what happened and why I felt that way during that time, and so extremely at that. Can anyone help me determine what that might have been?

Anyways, back to being addicted to heartbreak, Once this new year started, I realized that I have to be better to myself, and I had been doing okay until quarantine/covid. Begin stuck in isolation isn't anything new to me, that'a practically how I live my life on the daily! But something about being isolated by government mandate and bound by the fear that you or your loved ones could die does something to a person and makes every day hard, especially for someone who's already most likely got an anxiety disorder that they should probably get professional help for. 

Being stuck in quarantine made me finally realize that some of my problems were stemming from my addiction, especially health related problems like my memory and focus. Recently, my memory's been pretty shit and it's scaring me. And also my focus has shifted from being super aware to my surroundings and being able to multitask like nobody's business, to having to focus on what people are saying one at a time. When I'm reading something for example, someone could be talking straight in my ear, and I subconsciously tune them out so that I can't even hear them. I always have to backtrack and ask people to repeat themselves now, it's also scaring me.

Once I finally got it through my head that something was wrong with the way I ""like"" being heartbroken, I researched a little bit and found that depression can affect your memory. I also found that several hormones released when someone is heartbroken can be pretty damaging to their heart, especially when those chemicals are released frequently (which they shouldn't be), like it's been for me (which is another thing I've been having slight issues with)

So, I had a quiet and quick intervention with myself and decided to go the route as if I had a smoking habit: to go cold turkey. Since it was affecting my physical and mental health so drastically, it was time to change something, and since 2020 was the year that I was going to change my mental health around, why not still make a baby step with something somewhat manageable while stuck? And so far, I've been doing pretty good on that aspect! I haven't been thinking too hard about my love-life anymore (still have the cynical outlook on it however, never gonna find love, blah blah). I know I don't *need* to have a romantic relationship with anybody, but they are envious sometimes. And I haven't been actively searching for stories to bring me down! Actually...confession. I've had this post in my drafts for a few weeks, coming back when I felt like it to keep adding more, and just now before coming to finish up this post I almost gave into my urge to read something to make me feel heartbroken. 

I finished a show today that had two main characters get together happily, and I felt the familiar feeling. It stuck around and made me a little depressed, and once I was finally in my room alone from the day, I started looking up stories. But as I was getting ready to read the first story I'd picked, I thought back to this draft saved and realized that *I can't keep doing this to myself*. Actually, I have the story I was going to read still open in another tab. 

With my addiction I know I'm holding myself back and keeping myself from growing by keeping myself in this state with these feelings, but it's also that I've been in this state so long that the feeling of heartbreak is so comfortable and easy to be in that I just slip back in without realizing what's happening. I'm going to try harder to keep myself from destroying me any further. I have many things to work on, but this is significant to me and I ~~hope~~ know I can better myself.

depression,"This life is absolute horse-shit. No matter how much I achieve for myself, my friends, my family, and everyone, they will always find a way to ABSOLUTELY FUCK ME OVER FOR SOME GODDAMN REASON. I'm almost at my limit. 

I built myself up since I was a child since because my father is an asshole and hasn't taught me anything about life. I grew up making my own set of morals (which is to be nice to people who are nice to everyone or something like that).

All of my ""friends"" are apparently jealous of my achievements in school even though I didn't think that much of it. I never bragged about it. I always kept lowkey. The only ones bragging about it was my family with their unnecessary pride in MY achievements. They always leave me out when they hangout. I'm always the one left out. I'm the one taking all the blame for being ""sMaRt"". I'm not even that smart. I was just trying to please my mother. Everyone has high expectations of me always, and it's very heavy and crushing.

I stuck with computer games since I had felt safe playing it. It was my coping mechanism. But even that was taken away from me as a child by my family. They always said I have to study more or play with my friends. I can't play with my friends. They all hate me. I'm always studying by my own. I just wanted something to make me feel happy and safe albeit how small it was. Is it that wrong to want to do something that makes you happy? 

Because of it all, I started to skip classes, started drinking, smoking, hanging out with the wrong people. Call me weak if you want. I didn't have much of a choice back then. I believed that they understood me. In reality, they just wanted my money. After I realized that, I got even more depressed. 

I started to resort to dating as another coping mechanism. But I didn't have a nice body. So I often got rejected at that time. And if they did go out with me, the relationship was short lived. 

My grades finally dropped like hell. I almost repeated a couple grades. I didn't know anymore. Everyone was saying that they were disappointed in what I become. I didn't give a f***. Deep down inside, I was glad they were disappointed. 

I decided that I would change myself for the better. I quit all my vices and started working out. I think I did well, but people still point out the time I fucked up. I didn't know what to do back then. I'm tired of everybody I know. My asshole father always says ""if you're so smart then why are you a fuck up during highschool?"". He didn't even graduate himself. Meanwhile I always hear rumors about me from other people. 

How much more do I have to do? Do I have to have a lean-ass body before I get respected? Do I have to achieve more so everybody in my snob-ass family won't hate me? I'm just tired of trying. 

I had a dream as a kid. I always though things would work out for me if I tried enough. My efforts didn't mean jackshit. Maybe I just have shitty luck and was meant to sad.

depression,"Ive been very on and off about music in the past. I honestly only listen to a select few songs for a few minutes at a time when Im having manic episodes of euphoria. But I cancelled my Spotify account last year. 

First I dropped hip hop. All the trap / rap I was blaring didnt have any meaning to me. All I hear whenever I listen to those songs anymore are a bunch of millionaires bragging about all the dollars they stack or all the beautiful women they fuck. 

After a while if paying attention to the lyrics, I realize that I didn’t relate to any of the themes. Many songs I actually enjoyed but for the most part it felt like I was only bumping that stuff in order to appear up to date with pop culture. 

Then I realized I dont relate to or particularly enjoy songs of any other genre.  Fame, Wealth, Success, Love — all themes that I dont relate to or even understand. So none of the lyrics of practically any mainstream song hit home. 

In fact I actually get depressed when I hear songs being played about those things (and pretty much all music is about that stuff now). Just walking through a grocery aisle is hard for me sometimes because of all the upbeat music playing in the store. It makes me reminisce about important moments in my life that could have been beautiful and cherished memories but instead ended up being less than I had hoped. It makes me think about how undesirable I am and how much happier everyone else who can relate to those themes is. 

Same thing with movies. All I see are Hollywood tropes, cheesy acting, corny storytelling, and very often themes about love and empathy that I cant relate to.

My fiance is still working... He didnt get laid off... And he is working from home...  Ive been such a piece of shit... Not doing much... But he doesnt even notice when i do anything small.... He keeps asking in the worst ways to describe whats going on with me... But i cant. I just break down crying and here i am again doing exactly that.... What do i do? How do you explain this to people you love? I just feel like im not a person anymore and i cant go on like this!!!  Now with the riots here too... It just feels like life will never go back to normal and im losing it,Cant explain my feelings to my SO,t3_gt2btf,0

depression,"Because it's what I've done in the past years. I feel like my mind is blank, ever since I've been feeling empty. I can't find ideas, I can't think properly, when people ask me basic questions like : ""what's your favorite color?"" I don't even know what to respond to them. I feel stupid. 

It's tiring. Because it makes me feel selfish, and I just hate it. I used to be so much better, but now I just can't think by myself. Social anxiety has won. I'm so scared of ending up alone, with no kids, no husband, unmarried.

I'm tired of holding on when there's nothing at the end of the tunnel. Unless I dont change it is never going to change.
It kills me that friends miss me when I don't even notice I've stopped talking to them for a month. It scares me to think that if my cats died, I'd cry but it will feel like it doesn't really affect me.

I'm just exhausted of not feeling anymore, of not knowing who I am, of not knowing what to do, and handling the truth, that I've become a piece of shit, is too much for me.

I know I still have worth. I used to. I liked learning about physics, I liked learning about science, I liked learning about improving my photography. But now I'm just frustrated because I know I need to get the fuck up of my bed and earn the things everyone has.

It seems so hard to rebuild what I've lost and what I lack. I'm still young, but I feel trapped. I don't feel valid. 

I need to learn how to drive, but I don't even find the motivation to do that. I need the motivation to go to school too, but it's not for me, and yet I want to make my parents proud. Fuck this. I need help. I can't do this alone. I don't even feel comfortable around family. I feel constantly judged and unvalid.

It feels more boring than scary. You just wake up in the underworld and you don’t know when you are going to be able to get out. Your critical mind tells you that it will be temporary, but another part of you is convinced that the underworld is reality and that is how is going to be forever. Not only that, is even convinced that your whole past has happened in that underwhelming boring and gloomy reality.

Then one day, you wake up and you don’t feel that anymore. And it’s even difficult to recall the feeling of doom and gloom you felt in the underworld. You are ok now, but you also know you’ll pass to the other side again sooner or later.

depression,"I want to preface everything by saying, right now, I don't want to die. 

A few days ago it was a year ago that I tried to kill myself. Thankfully I failed. I've only told 3 people about what happened. My mama found me but thankfully I don't think she quite realised what my intentions where. It's also been 2 months since I stopped doing cocaine. It was kinda imposed by the whole global pandemic/lockdown situation but hey, I'm not complaining. Whilst I certainly wasn't a rampaging drug addict or living some next Requiem For A Dream lifestyle, it was getting a little out of hand again. 

Anyways the reason im making this post is because I still feel fucked up. A few days ago the voice inside my head started telling me I should kill myself. I started seeing how I would do it. It gave me no fucking peace. My life is generally wonderful. I'm fighting this shit. At the start of lockdown I could barely do 10 press ups, now I can do 75 in a row. I'm exercising daily. I've had a real creative hot streak several times these last 2 months. I've cut my drinking from a lot everyday to maybe a beer or two a day. I'm somehow financial in the best position of my life. I have friends and family who love me and I love them. I fucking love my dog man, I don't want to die. 

But, I'm still in pain... I slipped down the stairs earlier and I bashed my knee and it hurt for a bit. I guess that's what sparked this post. I could feel that pain, it felt acceptable. I could identify what was hurting and why. This is different tho. I don't think I'm depressed. Two winters ago, I was heavily depressed. Maybe the worst hole I've ever been in. I couldn't get out of bed for months. I shut down completely. I fought my way out of it and just as everything was sunny I tried to kill myself, over nothing and pretty much out of nowhere.

That's how I've been feeling again with these fucking voices in my head man. I'm tired all the time. I'm tired of having this goldmine of a life but having this raincloud follow me around everywhere. I'm on a little bit of citalopram, the doctor thought it might level me out a bit. I don't know if the pills are working or not.

depression,"Probably why I'm here, seeking consolation from strangers on the internet. I've been what I call passively suicidal for several months now. There's probably a term for it already. Like, I probably won't do anything to actively harm myself, but if I'm outside and see a car speeding toward me, I wouldn't get out of the way either. It's nothing new for me. Feels like it happens every 6-8 months. And for a large portion of my life, I had a support system in place. Therapists, psychiatrists, friends to turn to. Now I feel like I don't.

I lost my job with decent insurance last August, and the first things to go were my therapist and psychiatrist. I simply cannot afford $100+ per session when I'm not working. But for a while, I was able to make it work by practicing techniques they taught me and going to certain friends, with their consent, when things got too bad. But my friends have seemed less and less interested in helping me as time has gone on. 

I'm pretty heavily introverted, but despite that, I had a decent amount of friends. I had 7 people that I could semi-reliably rely on. Usually it played out that if one wasn't available, another would be. I always respected boundaries, I would ask if they were in a good enough head space to handle talking to me, and if they said no, I never tried to guilt trip them over it. But then 2 of them moved out of city; one about 3 hours away, the other halfway across the country. 1 has never been too great at this sort of thing because her brother killed himself when she was a teen, and I always respected that. 1 seemingly disappeared after some really personal issues involving two women and two children.
Another 1 was one of the two women I just mentioned, and she kind of blames me for introducing her to that friend. 1 got a new boyfriend, who didn't like that sometimes my texts would upset her, and he threatened to kick my ass if it happened again. And the last 1 is my wife, who's been my rock for many years, as I've tried to be hers. But last night, I told her about how I was feeling, and she sighed. It was that kind of exasperated sigh, similar to the one you give when you see your dog making a mess on the carpet again.

My family is no help. Mom's approach is to lecture me on how good I've had it compared to other people, and Dad's basically a bolder with glasses. His Dad was never emotionally available for him, so he never learned to be emotionally available for me and my brothers. My younger brother is working in another state, and I had a bad experience with my older brother that involved a lot of whiskey and a rifle, so we don't talk much.

I've had bad experiences with hotlines and text lines. I've been put on hold more than once, and the one time I tried a text line, they called a wellness check on me using information I didn't give them.

depression,"I feel so sad right now. I just don’t know what to do w myself. So many things are bothering me rn and I j don’t know how to function. Below is a list of shit that’s on my mind:

My gf texted me today and told me her mom has scabies, and that I can’t come visit her again until I get tested for scabies since I was w her a couple weeks ago, that way her family doesn’t get it again. It’s such a huge inconvenience since doctors offices are packed rn bc of covid. Plus, my anxiety ridden father is gonna freak out and get onto me for being around someone w scabies, as if I could help that.

Its the weekend so my parents will be home for the next 2 days, which also means that they’re gonna drink tonight. They’re such a horrible influence on my mental health and I hate being around them, especially when there’s alcohol involved. They’re also obnoxiously loud until the early morning, and make it so hard to sleep/feel at peace.

My engagement ring came in the mail today. It’s too small, so I have to get it resized, which is a huge pain in the ass, since there’s no jewelers open rn bc of covid.

I also have to pick up my brother from work tonight at 11. His dumbass still can’t drive, and makes no effort to learn. I’m so tired of driving him around, especially since he’s 22 years old.

At the same time, I have to take my aunt home tonight, since she’s coming over to drink w my parents and can’t drive home.

I also miss my gf like hell. She’s 31 weeks pregnant and I hardly get to see her bc we live 2 hours away from each other. I won’t get to see her again until 2 weeks from now.

I’ve been working a lot lately to save up money for an apartment. It’s so exhausting, working 40 hours a week at a grocery store. It’s so taxing on my body, especially since I have to wake up at 4 AM 3 times a week. And it’s such manual labor, my back and legs are often on fire. I’m always so tired, plus I have to fight for my hours bc they’d rather give the hours to new employees than me, who’s worked there for almost 5 years.

Since I’m saving my money, I can hardly spend on anything I want. I’ve been wanting to play doom eternal for a while now, but i can’t just shell out $60. So I’ve been trying to learn how to speedrun one of my fav games, dark souls, but that’s really all I have to do.

I’ve had very little hobbies lately. Everything is so boring, and I get little joy from anything nowadays that doesn’t concern my gf. She’s the only one that makes me feel anything. I tried to go camping w my friend the other day, and all I did was eat, drink, and stare at a campfire until I fell asleep.

I’m also rly tired of hearing about the riots from my family, especially my dad. He’s super racist, and sometimes I wonder if he was waiting for BLM to do something just so he can complain about how much he hates black ppl. Additionally, he’s always making everyone feel miserable constantly because he’s controlling, manipulative, micromanaging, obnoxious, disgusting, and mean. 

My family hasn’t been supporting me through my gf’s pregnancy either, which makes things all the more difficult. Every second my daughter, gf, or marriage gets brought up, I get lectured.

depression,"Extremely lost post, so sorry about that, tldr at the end. Sorry in advance if there are grammar mistakes. English is not my main language. Thanks in advance for reading. 

I am a 26 year old woman who has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression last year. Who at the moment lives sorta with her boyfriend in his student home (one room where you eat, live, sleep and cook, the shower and toilet is shared with 13 other students). I have a student home myself, but I do not feel at home anymore there, My room is even smaller than his, and my housemate that lives underneath me has a girlfriend whom he likes to have sex with extremely loud. I already tried saying anything about it but my ptsd gives me flashbacks and I remember saying to my brother to walk the dog and he just beat me up till I bled because I asked. This happened multiple times with my brother, my mom and her boyfriend. Im afraid to even ask the simplest things of adult males due to this.
I also cannot really be alone for to long or I lose myself and stop taking care of myself. But I have to get back to my student home pretty soon, otherwise my SO will lose his home due to the fact im continuously with him and as soon as they think we live together (what we are indeed doing for my own sake), he will get kicked out of his own home. 

This all escalated when corona virus hit. I still had a job mid March (this was in a shop where we sell tabacco products and lottery tickets). Untill I got symptoms and I asked my boss if it was okay for me to stay home to protect my boss (above 65 years) and all of the regulars (who are mostly also above 65 years). She did not take me seriously. She thought I was bluffing. So her idea was to stop my contract just till I was better. When I felt better they would just activate my contract again.

Well jokes on you, fast forward 4 days. The symptoms got less and I felt good enough to work. I called my boss and she just blunty told me she wasnt going to activate my contract anymore, since not a lot of people come to the shop at the moment. She decided to close her shop till she could open up again.

That was a lie. My parents live close by my job and they told me the shop was still open. I tried asking her for reason but she kept ignoring me all the time.

So she told me to ""just"" get a settlement payment, I was entiteled to get it anyway, due to corona. Fun part, this was in march and I am currently still fighting for my settlement payment, so that I can pay my rent and bills.

I will try to explain it in english, its the dutch goverment I will try to explain.
So you basically have WWpayment and Assistance payment. WW is the one mostly people are entitled for when they lose their job. Assistance payment is when you have no right on any settlement payment, so that's basically the last option anyone has.

I ofcourse went for WWpayment since I thought I had the right for it. Turns out, because I switched jobes last December, I do not have the right for WWpayment. I worked at the shop for 12 weeks. You need to work at least 16 weeks to have the right for a WWpayment. So I went and try to get assistance payment. I had to wait a full month before it was my turn to try and get it. When they blunty told me that I had every right for a WWpayment and hence this whole roller-coaster began. They both had said no.

I was rejected because the job I had before my last one (its one where I worked more than 16 weeks so its normal the goverment starts looking at the most recent job that can give me the right for WWpayment) I quit on my own accord and its a very strict rule with WWpayment that you have no right if you quit yourself, because that way you make yourself jobless, hence no right. BUT. 1 week before my last day at that job, I had already signed a contract with my last job, hence I was never jobless and made sure I had an income. I changed jobs because the job I worked at (kinda like wallmart I guess) was asking so much of me mentally and my therapist told me that it could help if I went and got a job that would be more at ease for my mentally state and thats why I switched. I told this to the agent (the one that takes care of my objection) and he simple told me that he could not use that since my therapist did not really ""force"" me to stop, she just suggested it. 

They told me to submit an objection against the decision of the WWpayment. An other fun thing, the end decision of my objection could take till September.
So today I sent an email because it has been 2 weeks since my last contact with the status of my objection and the agent that has me as his client called me back right away, which in a positive way was very done. But he told me that it would be extremely difficult to get me a situation where I have the right for WWpayment. But he will try to get a decision out by next friday.

I am so afraid that when I go back home, I will lose myself. I have had issues with money in the past (my nmom would not help me when I was 17 and full of debt because I could not find a job at that time) and it made me make decisions like stop buying food, just so I could pay a little bit of the bills to keep the debt collecters away. I am extremely afraid I will do it again and stop eating because bills are more important and I will never want to go back to when I had debt collectors on my doorstep. 

I am so so lost

TLDR; I got fired during the corona crisis in march, still fighting with the goverment for a settlement payment, while my boyfriend gets kicked out of the house if I stay any longer with him, but if im alone, I will lose my self sanity and stop taking care of myself just to be able to keep debt collecters away.",I lost my job during Corona crisis and slowly losing it,t3_gstuh8,0

depression,"First I should mention, I'm autistic.  I was diagnosed with the condition formerly known as Asperger's back in 1999 in my senior year of high school, while before then I thought I was just extremely shy.  

I grew up in a mentally abusive environment at home thanks to my asshole father, who also has been a hoarder since I was very little.  As long as I remember, there has been shouting in my house.  Mom and dad argued constantly.  Sometimes dad would get too mad and start throwing a tantrum, where he'd throw everything he could and break things.  He never got physical with either of us, but that's a small comfort. 

My mom supported me as best she could, but she was very overwhelmed and often said she had TWO children to take care of.  She never really taught me many life skills, but I do believe she was mentally stunted herself.  I taught myself most of what I know today.  Mom was a caretaker her whole life, first with her own father and older brothers, and then with dad and me.  She was very - not *conservative*, but let's say ""*trapped* in the past"".  She simply couldn't learn how to operate technology, like cell phones or a computer.  She liked using land lines with dial tones and (if she had to) library reference materials.  I'm surprised she could drive sometimes.  Now while I say that, she still let me be a tech savvy.  She took me out to buy my first computer (which I said I can do homework on, but we all know I just wanted to play Monkey Island on that thing)  We spent as much time together as she could, with her having a job and having to keep dad calm.  It's true she felt the brunt of his mind games and mental attacks.  

It killed her in the end, when she was having her second knee replacement surgery, she picked up a rare blood infection from the doctor not cleaning the surgical tools properly.  She got sicker and sicker, until her kidneys and bladder failed. Dad became very unhinged at the thought of losing her, and his ""nice guy"" facade he puts on for friends and neighbors vanished.  The police were actually called to remove him from the home.  They had riot gear on because dad told the State investigator who called in to check up on me that he was in the living room ""playing with his guns"".  So then he was gone, I was left home alone with dad's hoard, and I was taken by a friend to visit my mom every weekend.  She had given up on her own recovery, refusing to eat or go to therapy.  And the last memory I have of her is as a near-skeleton who was shouting for her dad to help her.  This was in 2018.  Her dad died before I was born, pre-1982.

Nothing was left to me, there was no money paid towards my future, and the house I grew up in needed to be sold to pay for dads new living arrangements at an Adult Protective Services facility.   

Before I could leave, I had to get help from family friends in finding a new family for my two cats because I couldn't take them with me.  The last memory I have of THEM was my female cat and her panicked wide eyes and mewling sounds of sadness and terror.  She had never been caged before, and I had to keep her in one so she could be moved to live with her new family  She was panting heavily, panicked.  What might have been worse is seeing my little munchkin cat.  His older brother died a year ago and they were inseparable, to the point he refused to eat his food, instead searching the house for his brother.  I was the one who coaxed him to eat, calmed him down at night when he was crying, and then he finally, *finally* started sitting on my lap.  Oh but no, sorry, we can't be together anymore, I'm sending you away.  When the lady came to pick them up, with my girl mewling and pleading, the munchkin just sat there n his cage, not reacting, not crying.  He just stared.  It was very out of character for him.  It was as if he just mentally broke.  Like he couldn't comprehend why this was happening to him.

I lived in a hotel room with my dog for a year.  I fought tooth and nail for my dog.  After what happened with my kitties, I didn't want to lose him too.  So eventually a hotel was found that allows dogs.  

Of course, because it's me, it didn't last.  We stayed in the hotel for almost a year before the State found a place for me to stay.  It didn't take animals so I also had to betray my dog too and give him away.   I made a promise then and there if I ever got my own home, I would **never** ever have any more pets.  How could I just replace them like that?  I was already enough of a monster.

More recently, my dad died of the virus, but I shed no tears for him, especially with how his guardian contacted me.  They asked me if I had anything I wanted to say to him.  I told them I'd think about it, at that point I figured, okay, I could either yell at him finally, or forgive him.  But it didn't actually matter, because about an hour later the hospital itself called me saying they've been trying to contact me until his guardian gave them my number, so they can tell me my dad passed away over the weekend, which was 4 days ago.  One last attempt at mental manipulation from beyond the grave.

I'm still having anxiety attacks and mental breakdown where I start pacing the apartment, angrily cussing myself out and just yelling at the top of my lungs, which I'm very surprised the neighbors don't hear.  Until I finally get a therapist, I'll go along with diagnosing myself with CPTSD.  Or maybe I'm just crazy, who knows anymore?

Of course I'm triggered by what's happening in the world right now, too.  Yet I feel too mentally old and tired to do anything but pace and scream.  I hate being informed, but I don't want to *not* know what's going on either.  I feel peoples pain, but I'm too weak to help.  I have barely enough money to support myself.  I'm scared of arguments.  I don't drive.

I have had life goals that I feel in my mind are too unrealistic for me to ever achieve, including owning my own home and having friends that I can invite over for summer barbecues like my mom used to do.  Except I don't want to live a long life in this world, so I don't think there's enough time to achieve my dream at this point.  I wish I could have started earlier.  I think most people avoid me because I can be a downer.  It's depressing to hang out with me although I do enjoy having friends around, what little I have.  I try to be happy for them.  Smiling and laughing gets exhausting so quickly though.  I just wish I had more than I do right now.  Everything happens slower for me.  My friends all have their own homes, are married with kids.  One is a single mom who just had a patio put up a few days ago.  I want to be happy for her, but I'm jealous.  Why is everyone else so much better off than me?

There's so much more, but that's all I have the energy for right now.  I think depression is the least of my problems, honestly.",I am a tired wreck of a person.,t3_gt46o3,0
depression,"Hi, hopefully I can get some feedback. I don’t know what it is but I just feel like a failure. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the right thing. But don’t have the right mentors or leadership to actually take that next step. after reading this, I’m sure that a lot of you won’t think there’s an issue. It could just be me and I just want to be held at a higher standard.


To begin I’m currently a junior in college, 3.0 classes going great. I secured a internship which will continue this upcoming semester. Also plan on going to grad school when I’m done in New York. The only issue is that I feel like a failure, the only reason because I don’t have a job. The bulk of my money comes from either savings which I have around 2000 and money I get from either a FASFA check or from family to help while in school. During this summer it has been hard, my mother is supportive of me but brings me down on multiple occasions and just makes me feel like shit. I may be emotional but the things she says hurts my feelings and makes me feel like I should be doing better in life. 

Looking for a job has been a priority of mine, my sister recently got a job at a local supermarket. While I’m still looking for a job, but I’m having no luck so far. I have told her that I have enough money to not have to worry about getting a job right now in this economy. I don’t need anything right now to begin with. I want to change his mindset, I don’t have a problem working but the fact that I can’t get a job when the summer rolls around is bothering me

She always brings up the fact that I got fired from my previous jobs, due to little things like being laid off and racist managers. Everything seems to be my fault at the end of the day. I want to change this mindset within me. I’m a happy individual but when I get around my mother and start talking she makes me depressed even though I love her dearly she’s the only parent I have in my life. 

The question being what should I be doing at 22 that I’m missing out on because of thinking I’m a failure. This may seem like a brag post but it’s not I feel lost in life and that I should be doing something different right now.

Most of my hobbies range from hanging out with friends to reading and playing games. So me being in the house an entire day makes me feel like I’m wasting my life and should be at greater heights at the age of 22. As I have stated this may be a mental issue I have, I have no idea maybe anxiety about life.",I feel like I have no purpose in this world at 22... I need a leader in my life,t3_gt43ay,0

While this is going on my grandma is stressed out all day everyday to the point where her blood pressure was insanely high. She might have to go to the hospital as well. Also my dad got a call from his doctor and we figured out that he might have blood clots in his lungs.  My whole family has been down and I don’t want to make them anymore sad so I came here to talk.

depression," I am depressed since a very long time, years I think, with ups and downs.  

Two weeks ago I decided to try to do things and go out. I forced myself to start exercising so I went walking everyday for one hour, biking in the park. I started to search a job too, meditate more, start yoga again, try to avoid social media and internet...

Sadly it is not that easy. I don’t feel better inside. I thought doing lots of good things like that will help me emotionally but I had more anxiety (specially in the park when I see happy and noisy people everywhere) and troubles to sleep since then. Maybe it is adaptation, i hope so. 

Anyway today. Today I went walking in the street going to nowhere and found a little church in my neighborhood. It was opened and there were nobody in there (middle of the afternoon). I sat on a bench and felt really good. I was here, and just fine. I am an atheist but staying in a place like that makes me feel very calm. It makes me think how little I am, in this planet and space, how there were actually a lot of people who suffered century’s ago. I actually cried. It was relief. Lots of places have this effect on me like museums, huge landscapes, some libraries, nature.. but it is always crowded or hard to find in a city.

Churches are empty in afternoons most of the time. The light is amazing. The stained glass windows are beautiful. There is real silence. You can sit, or not. You can meditate. You can think. You can pray. It is huge, quite impressive. And it is fresh these days during summer.

depression,"School is the only thing stopping me from committing suicide, I don't know what I will do without it. I just can't stay all day everyday with my parents, my mother screaming profanities at the smallest thing and hitting me on a daily basis, and my father who hasn't answered my texts in three weeks. (I only see him one day a month).

My mother already said I can't hangout basically with anyone (only once a month and with people she approves, only one in my whole fucking school). And, I won't have my phone until I finish all of the ""homework"" that she gave me, because she doesn't like the fact that school didn't.

Also the only teacher I genuinely cared about and that I thought cared about me has started ignoring me. We used to text a lot during quarantine because I liked speaking to her and she's a good listener, but a month ago she stopped answering, so I asked if she was okay and she said yes. but she hasn't spoken to me since. I wonder what did I do wrong. She hasn't asked me how I am in weeks, and I'm tired of emailing her randomly and rarely getting a reply. I really hope that at least she's happier now.

depression,"Mid twenties. Never want to follow up on anything. I just want to take life and do the bare minimum...but you can't really do that. You can't really do the bare minimum. Not if you want a place to live. I don't know. I pick one or two directions, maybe three. I just can't stick to anything. I get one thing done, one little step, and everything in my being, everything in my mind, everything in my body, just wants the work to be over with. There's always more. There's all the other steps you have to take to get to where you want to go. Each and every grueling step...after every achievement wishing that was just the end of it. 

I don't feel like celebrating. Nothing I do feels inherently good or worthy of respect. I just feel tired man. But I can't just take a nap. There is shit to do. I got plenty of stuff done this afternoon. But still, there is shit to do. There is always shit to do. 

I'm tired of continuously learning. I'm tired of studying. It doesn't matter what the end goal is. To have a life for myself, to make a decent income. Sure I could start a business...if someone else that wasn't me was there to give me the answers every step of the way. I'm just not that creative or free-thinking. Just the thought of deciding how much it would cost to get started doing something, or to start learning in a subject....it's enough to want to go to sleep forever. I want to study for as ASVAB, but I don't have the motivation to put in all the work I need to in order to do that. It's the same thing with studying anything. I just don't want to learn anymore. 

And I'm a coward. Too much of a socially anxious, conscious piece of shit. I'm not man enough to find clients for myself. I'm not man enough to put myself out there. I'm not man enough to build relationships with people. I try to put on a mask at work...I don't want to do that either. But I don't have a choice. 

I just don't have the energy to adapt to life's demands. I just get so tired. I just get so tired from thinking about anything, whether it's the future or the task right in front of me. It all just makes me so tired. I wish I could just slip away peacefully in my sleep. I heard a highschooler who just recently graduated on the radio today saying not to take the time you have for granted, that you have to enjoy what time you have left. But I don't enjoy it. There isn't a way for me to enjoy it. Everything just makes me so tired. I don't want to follow up on anything in my life. People tell me I need to keep my future in mind. I don't want to think about the future. I don't want the future to come to fruition. I just want to sleep. 

I wake up and work out. I try to be efficient and get my goal in for the morning. I usually fail at this. Not getting everything in I wanted to. Because I need to dedicate my time to things where it's actually needed. But I barely have the wherewithal to follow up with those things either. I barely had enough energy to leave the house again earlier in order to pick up the car I just bought with all the money I got from the government. That's a good thing; I needed this car. But I don't know. I'm still so tired. I got the damn thing and just went back home. There were things I needed to get from the store afterwards. Not really needed, more like investments in things that I could do to make money. But I'm so tired. I'm so tired of thinking about how to chase money. That's all there really is to most of life. Chasing money. Dreams come second. Might as well not have any dreams at all. I guess I really don't have them anyways. Goals I mean. I can tell myself, oh, I want to accomplish this, or oh, I want to accomplish that, but none of that is actually true. None of that is really true deep down in my soul.

I'm stuck in arrested development. Stuck in an endless, sad, pathetic nostalgia ride. It was video games. And music. And thinking about my old friends. My old love interests. The fun I've had in the past. No reverence for the presence or future. Just being inside in the air conditioning or outside in the sun inundates my entire being with nostalgia; a feeling of safety, safe places, familiar people, a lack of true responsibility. Would an actual adult ever want to go back to those days? Where they had less freedom? Perhaps.

I'm also not going to disclose the reasons I can't for fear of self-incrimination (like I said it's complicated.) It has to do with my job. If there is a better reddit I should seek wisdom from, please suggest it in the comments. 

To start off, this is going to be a long rant of word vomit. I've never EVER talked about this topic with anyone, even my mom or older sisters. I'm not very good at speaking or writing or any of those types of subjects. Was always better at math and science. I'm a 27M so it's been 20 years since this happened. I grew up with no older brothers or other male role models in the house or around us. My mom never remarried or brought guys around. It was just us, but I don't think I've ever been happy or even know what that is. Sure I've had happy moments, but once that moment is over it's bad to the slump. Here lately though, probably the last 6-9 months, I've been on a huge self-help/self-improvement kick and I'm ready to try and tackle this part of myself (at least anonymously with total strangers so there's no judgment, or at least no judgment I'll care about.) 

So to start off I'm gonna say I don't remember much from my childhood after that incident up until maybe 7th grade, so 12 or 13. I remember the day vividly. I remember coming home from school to cop cars surrounding the house, and not knowing ehat was going on. I remember the funeral. I remember not crying at the funeral. I remember running away from home sometime after, though I can't remember my thoughts or reasons at that time as to why. I got put in the Big Brother/Big sister program after, but I don't think I understood why at the time and didn't really connect with the people because of it. Since then I've been a pretty cold person, short of the occasional sobs during sad movies. My aunt (mom's sister) died of cancer when I was 14. Didn't really feel bad at all (my mom's side of the family is all pretty close and so are us cousins). Basically I'm curious if I'm less capable of empathy(sympathy? idk which) because of it. With women I'm extremely affectionate, caring, and giving though. I tend to put their needs first. I've read stuff that said sometimes children growing up in single parent homes try and fill the void of the other parent with a s/o. I've always been either dating someone, or trying to date someone. Right now I'm consciously single though. Taken myself off the market. If that is an issue I want to fix it and not put that burden on someone else. I've also been addicted to porn, masturbation, and impulsive sex that leaves me feeling empty afterwards for as long as I can remember. Probably porn since I was 11, masturbation at maybe 12 or 13, and then sex at 14 with the first woman willing. Also trying to conquer this at the same time. Like I said, a huge kick. A few months ago one of my sisters tried to raise the topic with me and I immediately shut down. On the verge of tears. Just wanted her to stop talking. I couldn't even think about it. I think I made her feel bad about it, and I'd like to be able to discuss it with family members eventually, and apologize to her.

Basically looking for someone maybe experiencing/experienced the same situation willing to shed some insight. I'm horrible at putting my thoughts into words so I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out (also working on this and trying to write my thoughts everyday in a notebook).

depression,I've been depressed since february and have kept it to myself until a couple weeks ago. I told about it to my two best friends and now it seems like I'm wearing them down with my negativity. One of them first wanted to help me but then I told her I'm hopeless and now she's ignoring me and doesn't seem to care anymore. The other friend called me out yesterday saying that I don't care about her since I only talk about myself and that I don't appreciate her advice since I keep talking back to her and only come with negative comments. I just can't be positive and I'm letting them down. I wish I had someone to talk to who wouldn't judge me or tell me to be positive or ignore me and who could handle all my negativity.

depression,"So I've been wanting Nintendo Switch for quite some time now, but didn't have the money and had too much uni homework to earn any.

My life is just so fucked up you know. I've accomplished nothing I'm just doing stupid unnecesery mean things ugh. What the fuck did I do in my life ugh!

I was borned as kind little boy. Grew up like normal, had friends but got bullied. Moved to high school and got bullied. Made a friend who I got a crush on while being suicidal. 

Shit got fucked up bc I started to annoy her with stalking and shit while also dealing with my puberty fuck ups with some dutch youtuber with 777k subs. Bc both felt unjustified. The girl shouldn't have left when I was in a bad mood. The stalking wasn't even to hurt but to get my friend back only after expressing what then was supposed to be my 'dark past'  what made me become a online stalker to annoy her. Bc I tought she was bad advertisement for me and new people I met.
For some fucked up reason I became a right winger and I can't get it out of my head I fucking can't. I also started threatening with terrorism at my worst time in life.

I got reported 2 times 3 crimes. ID fraud, Threaths and online stalking (in my country you get punished like normal stalking) nothing happened after my mental breakdown. I was worried that I would go to prison. Never happened bc of the nice cops and my confession I guess

I have therapy started in april 2019 and will stop in september. I made 3 friends I they will be gone in 2 months.

In a this time I have made 5 friends and will end with a total loss of 6.

I'm afraid my dad will go out of the picture. Once he is gone. My brother has moved on. My cousin, my aunt will be old, my nieces from Denmark are all the way across fucking europe.

I will be a lonely stupid fucking man. I should rot for real. I ruined my life. I did, I always blame others for it. Always, that one time I blamed myself... I started blaming others bc I was done with it.

I can't get my fucking life back I can't do shit. I won't kill myself bc I can't. I just can't. It's a unkown force that tells me NO. So I obbey and Idk why bc I have reasons.

depression,"TL;DR I was on the verge of killing myself. Best friend called as I was going to do it and saved my life.

To give background over the past 6 months I've been dealing with severe depression. I mean to the point where I break down every week and lose control of myself. I've been relying on my friends basically completely as they just want to help pull me out and help. I started the process to get help. Ive gone through a couple different counselors but I actually found one I liked finally. I have an appointment this coming Tuesday. Well this past tuesday I completely broke down and wanted to end it all. My best friend stayed on the phone with me all night so she knew i was safe. I had even written a suicide note. After Tuesday the feeling never really went away. I continued to feel like this and just bottled it up until it all came out last night. All my thoughts of self hatred, all my thoughts of how much i wanted the pain to end came out. And for some awful reason I read my note from the other night. And I decided that it was time to end it all. For real this time. I sent out one goodbye text to my best friend and kinda sat there for a few moments completely ready to do it. Completely ready to end it all. And right as i was going to do it I got a phone call. It was her and I even tried to ignore her call. But she kept calling. We talked on the phone and i was in a really really dark place saying some really awful stuff. She had someone in her family call 911 for her so she could stay on the line with me. And i realized this during the conversation and even got angry at her for doing it. Soon enough there was a knock at the door and my cousin was standing there. Hes a cop in our city. He heard the address and details come over and raced over to be there first. We sat outside and talked for a while. He decided not to take me against my will since I am actively trying to get help. But he also made me go somewhere I wouldn't be alone. So I called her back and just cried on the phone for a few hours. If she hadnt called me when she did i wouldn't be here today.

depression,"First time posting to reddit. Not even sure I’m doing this right. I’ll try to keep this post as condensed as possible. Just need some advice. 

2 years ago me (23m) and my girlfriend (22f) had our first child. It was unexpected and with really no preparation for this, we had to move into her moms house together to raise our child for awhile until we got our lives on track and could move out and live on our own. 

Since I found out about the baby coming, I started dealing with depression, anxiousness, and all around worry. This would happen on and off for the first 1.5 years of my daughters life and whilst it was a bit of an obstacle, it did go away and things started getting better. Recently though, things took a bad turn for me. I was laid off from my job due to the covid pandemic. Within a week of being home, doing nothing, my depression quickly came back. Feeling of uselessness, wanting to give up, just overall feeling numb to life. Passion was gone. This is where I need some advice: because of my on and off depression, my girlfriends family look at me like a piece of trash. Her mother has called me a bad parent behind my back (which I’m not, but because some days I just need to take a step back and have time to myself, she considers me to just be slacking and lazy). It’s gotten to the point to where we pretty much both avoid each other. This past weekend me, my gf, her sister, and friend all had plans to go out on a boat ride. The night before these plans, I had a bad panic attack and pretty much sat up all night by myself in the dark just stuck in my own head, the next day I told my gf that I wasn’t feeling like going out on the boat. This in turn caused a lot of issues. My gf didn’t want to go without me, I told her she should go and enjoy herself and that I would just work through this slump, but she insisted. She messaged her sister and told them we wouldn’t be going. They showed up to our house anyways. Angry at us for cancelling last minute. Her friend was also angry for the same reason. And now it’s all awkward between my gf and her family. They think I’m dragging her down and what not, that I’m controlling her. When in reality, me and my gf are very happy with each other and she just wants to help me get through this. Not one time I have I asked her to do anything for me and I’ve made it clear that I will not because I don’t want my issues to get in the way of her life. Both her friend and her sister are in school to be registered nurses. Both of them talk on social media about how important it is to check up and help friends with depression, but it seems like since my depression has inconvenienced them, they’re angry with me and want me out of their life. I feel bad about all of this and it’s making it hard to recover. I don’t want to pull their family apart. I don’t want them to dislike me. I plan on marrying my gf one day and I’d like their approval. And you’d think since they’re studying to be nurses, they would be more open minded about this. And now I’m really worried that since they’re acting like this, it will cause my gf to also be against me. And the last thing I want is to lose her. How do I deal with this? Is this something I should just let blow over? We actually plan on moving out within the next month so it will get us away from the family for awhile, and maybe that will help in some cases.

depression,"I've been considering posting this for a while, and always change my mind once I have a good day or two in a row and figure everything's great.

All in all, my life is pretty great, I'm not mad at that. I still have a job right now, good friends, a new girlfriend, a nice apartment, and often lots of exciting things going on in my life.

But still, I find myself laying in bed or on the couch frequently, feeling bad or angry at myself for where I'm at in life or past mistakes. I won't drag out a story, I'll keep that for my therapist. I've put in 2 years of talk therapy which has helped a ton, gotten out of a horribly toxic relationship, and cleaned up my life a ton, but this mix of anxiety and depression does truly limit what I'm doing in life. Problem is, it's mostly the past that leaves me feeling guilty, the present that makes me bored and hopeless, and the future that gives me anxiety. This isn't new either, it's been off and on and generally growing over the last few years - my last relationship really fired it up though.

I've missed work, I give up or postpone career goals, make excuses to not hang out with friends, or engage in self destructive behaviors out of disappointment in myself. I've started to wonder if going on meds for a year or so would help me to break out of this.

I'm currently on TRT which has helped quite a bit, but hasn't fixed things. I exercise very regularly, eat decently well (trying to get back on track there), and take much better care of myself than I used to. I have noticed I readily go for any substances that boost mood or lower anxiety - it's taken a lot of work to battle this, and I think it's a symptom of this rather than a cause.

I was on Parnate (an MAOI) years ago to get out of a rough spot, and while it didn't come without side effects, it got me out of a really rough spot. I tried other meds when I was younger, but I'm one of those people who believes MAOIs are the only ones worth a damn. I briefly tried Nardil but only gave it 2 days and was mad it made me tired. Considering how it'd impact my life if I gave it another shot.

depression,"(NSFW, because of some morbid imagery near the end that may trigger someone. This kinda goes all over the place, as I suck at structuring posts.) 

Just venting I guess. I’ve been off and on depressed for a few years now. It gets better for a little bit then can randomly spiral back down. 

I’m not good at holding down a job, so I live with my parents for free in a big house they happen to own. I don’t pay many bills besides the power bill, so I have spending money saved up. I thought that buying a bunch of instruments (I’m musical) would help make me happy, it does temporarily and then I just forget about them sometimes.   I went and bought a bunch of Switch games (which are expensive, physical copies) thinking they’d make me happy. I barely play them. 

I just feel stupid, ya know? I’m a young woman, live in a beautiful home in a pretty place, I barely work, barely pay bills, I don’t have kids. Single. Don’t have to worry about relationships. 

There’s literally people living in a damn ditch somewhere probably eating raw meat trying to survive and feed their children, and meanwhile I’m here sulking about never being happy. Why does it always have to be this way? 

I know that everyone has problems, and I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others all the time. 

I guess I’m finally understanding what people mean by “materialistic things can’t make you truly happy” or whatever. I’ve been able to buy all the things I previously wanted (but couldn’t afford before) within the last couple of months, and I’m still off and on depressed. 

I feel like I have a ton of potential, but I’m wasting it by sitting here in my house day by day doing absolutely nothing. 

I’ll go weeks or months without cleaning, sometimes food in the fridge rots so badly it starts liquefying, dirty dishes piled up in the sink, dirty laundry piled up. I smell like shit most days because I don’t feel like showering, or brushing my teeth. It’s too hard. When it was real bad, I went a month without showering. It just seems like so much work when it really isn’t. My mom used to get pissed and disappointed when she’d come here and see that nothing was cleaned and the dishes were piled up, but now she doesn’t say anything anymore, as when I was confronted about it I’d just start crying since I felt useless. 

I barely eat, since I don’t like grocery shopping and going out. I just eat whatever scraps are laying around, snacks in the cupboard, or whatever my mom happens to bring with her. 

I continually have bad images coming into my head that I try to push out... since I live here by myself 20 mins away from the closest town, I picture myself dying in my sleep or something and my body starts rotting in my bed before someone finds me. My parents sometimes only come here every few days, or sometimes once a week. I just keep imagining them walking into my room and finding a cold body. 

I sort of forgot about those recurring thoughts, but then the other day my mom and I were having a deep talk, and she started crying when telling me that even though my dad doesn’t show it, he worries about me so much that he’s on the verge of tears sometimes. And I’ve NEVER seen my dad cry in the 20 years of my life. 

My mom said he worries that he’ll come here and find me dead in my room. Then all those recurring thoughts came back. 

I’ve become so desperate to fix my life, I started turning to Christianity again, but no matter what I do nothing helps. I get terrible nightmares almost every night (if not a nightmare, then a really vivid dream). They rob me of proper sleep and the imagery is so gross and disturbing that I always remember it and it makes me cringe during the day. I can remember almost every single one of my vivid dreams to this day. Apparently that’s kinda rare. I don’t remember every single detail? But I remember the plot and the people in it, the places, etc. 

Anyway as a desperate attempt I’ve been trying to quote bible phrases and psalms before I go to sleep, I say them out loud and everything. But the dreams keep coming. In a lot of dreams I get raped by shape shifting demons. One dream in particular I was about to be raped by my father, and when I tried running away he started pelting me with stones. I was all dirty and was only wearing just a little night gown that was in tatters. I can still remember that dream as it was traumatizing. 

I’ve had a relatively good life, I was never sexually abused by my parents, was never abused in general, had a pretty normal childhood. NO IDEA why I get these sick dreams. Must be just from depression and anxiety? No idea. 

I’ve been to therapists, spoke to a psychiatrist, took meds (I don’t take them anymore, they don’t do shit). Mental health care is also really hard to come by where I’m from. The waiting list to see a therapist is usually long, and they don’t even do anything. There’s a psychologist that travels up here once in awhile but the waiting list is months long. The need for mental health care here is so strong. They probably aren’t even worth it anyway. 

I’ve tried most things. Nothing helps. I’m not as suicidal or catatonic as I used to be, but still depressed and anxious. I’m actually able to shower and brush my teeth a bit more, do laundry a bit more, clean a bit more. So that’s good. But the nightmares, recurring thoughts, and sleep schedule are still messed. And I’m just still depressed in general.

depression,"7 years ago I met this girl. We were great together, she was everything to me. Before her I was lost, doing drugs drinking and breaking my mother’s heart. But after I quit. I wanted to be there for the girl. We were together 7 years and last month she told me she doesn’t love me anymore. I did everything for this girl and I tried so hard to keep our relationship going. Even after she cheated I forgave her because I loved her too much. Before I left she said she was sorry for everything and for putting me through what followed. What followed was pain, depression, sadness and anger. She also said she will not do anything to hurt me more like go out or posts things that she’s already moved on until I heal and can move on. I’m still in pain, I can literally feel sharp stabbing pain in my heart. I can my sleep, I can’t eat and I can’t concentrate.

depression,"My dad (58) has always been there for everyone, no matter what. He's always been positive and just there for you, either for mental support or to help with any home improvement project you can think of. There's no way I would have ever thought my dad was severely depressed based on how he acted around me. I think he hid it because he wanted to be strong around his kids. 

About a year ago he was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer. I forget the name of it, but it is rarely fatal if managed properly with routine check ups and phlebotomy's. He's been on top of this and is doing great with it. Dr said he should live a normal life provided he continues to come in regularly. Then, after 25+ years working in a very physically exhausting job, he was asked to retire. This hit hard  but he bounced back and now has a pretty cool job he seemingly enjoys (granted much less income, but he also has his retirement which is not too shabby). Now, in hindsight I can absolutely understand why he would be depressed. He was honestly very positive about it around me and seemed to be taking everything well. His behavior seemed 100% normal. He was social with everyone, joked around, still acted like himself in every way. Didn't think there was a problem AT ALL. I honestly always thought it was crazy when people would say ""wow, we had no idea"" when someone commits suicide, because to me there HAD to be signs, but I understand that completely now. It's scary that someone could be in so much pain in their head but never display that to other people. 

The other day my dad wrote three notes; one to my mom, one to me, and one to my sister. He left documentation for his life insurance policies, tax documents etc on the table, left his cell phone at home, and left the house with his gun. My mom came home from work and found everything, called the police, and called me to come over. We got a 302 so that if the cops found him and he was alive, they can detain him. It was the most hysterical and stressful thing I have ever gone through. I thought I was never going to see my dad again. A police officer came over to update us on the search and while he was on our porch my dad pulled into the driveway. I was so relieved I literally hyperventilated.  

We went over and hugged him and cried, and the police officer explained that he had to take him to the hospital and was required to cuff him. My dad seemed surprised and insulted that we could do that to him. I think he expected to come home and just talk with us and everything would go back to normal and we could just forget this happened, which is ridiculous. Right now he is still in the hospital and being required to speak with counselors, but according to him they are telling him that he doesnt need to be there and is ok (I think/hope this is a lie to get us to let him come home early). He is very good at coming off as perfectly happy and rational, but I hope due to what happened these counselors can see past that. 

I spoke to him on the phone and he seemed like he understood what was going on and why he was there, and expressed to me that he also understood why we had to do that and was willing to open up and allow it to work, but when he speaks to my mom he says that he's angry we have him in there and contradicts that. I think he feels like he needs to not express himself to me because he doesnt want to be weak in front of his son. I really wish he could get over that and talk with me. He's been there for me my whole life, I just want to be able to be there for him now. Also, once he gets out of the hospital he has agreed to see a local (and fantastic) psychologist and has admitted that he needs to talk with someone, but we will see if his willingness continues.

PLEASE tell me how I can help. What can I do? Can I get him to open up to me? Should I even try, or just let him know I am here for him and dont push the issue? 

I have my BS in Psychology and from my neuro class when I was in school I remember that the hypothalamus (mood regulator portion of the brain) literally shrinks during  depression and regular exercise (in addition to standard treatment) helps cell regeneration in that area and begins to restore neuro connections and the exercise also releases serotonin which helps a lot. I actually got really into fitness years ago when my then fiancee ended things and it REALLY helped. My dad is already in relatively good shape, do you think pitching us exercising together would be a good idea? Maybe it can be a way to help him without asking him to become vulnerable with me?

Well, I got no choice -- only half of a month is left and I had to do something. But I'm dead inside and can't do it anymore. I feel sick from everything connected with IT. My eyes are aching from constant staring into computer. I'm suffering of problems with sleeping.

I never had a dream to be a programmer, but I had to do it. Just because my parents wanted me to do it. I wanted to be a programmer and even almost recieved my second higher education. But I will not recieve a translator's diploma without IT specialist's diploma. So, If I'm gonna fail my basic diploma, I'll fail everything. And after that...

Today I was texting some old (silenced for months) contacts (total count 2) for learning material of a class in university and in these contacts was one (let's call it o1), who is still a friend of another lost contact, which was hurting me recently and blocked me before I even could defend myself (let's call it t1). (I get overwhelmed in such situations quite easily, didn't really know where to begin with because these aggressive text-messages were bombarding me. So I froze and were only able to answer to some unnecessary points, even didn't explain my answers well enough until it was too late.) But I don't mind the lost contact (t1), because it was the fourth time I got very toxic messages from this person and I don't want to experience this ever again. But the hurting words last and won't go away. I didn't figure out how to get rid of them yet.

Now I feel like these words will chase me forever because I got a rude answer from the one old contact (o1) who is a friend of the lost contact (t1). I was texting my question to another old contact (o2) who I know had this class too and got a kindly and helpful answer with learning material. I also know that this old contact with the rude answer (o1) is normally also very kind and helpful.

depression,"Hi, I'm 23, autistic, have a mild physical disability, I'm in college for Business/Accounting, and felt down and depressed (no clinical diagnosis) for a while now. I have had unrequited romantic feelings for someone for about a year now... they had once hinted that I needed to be more of an adult for them to even have a chance to take interest in me, so I've been trying to work on getting a driver's license since September.

I have given up on actively getting them feeling the same way for me, but I still feel so strongly about them that I still want them to be a part of my life as a friend... but it seems like they've stopped even caring about me as a friend. They say otherwise if I ask, but I know how I feel.

So I decided to get a job to be more worthy of their time as a friend, to give myself some purpose during the summer while I only have one class, and to help my mom out with some of the bills. It's retail, so I'm barely making more than minimum wage an hour, and only about 20 hours a week, but I thought it would be a great start to get used to working.

It has been horrible. My boss is nice and so are my co-workers, but I feel woefully incapable of being able to perform anything at my job. I'm slow at stocking freight because I can never find where any of the products go. I'm slow at checking out customers at the register (and I even had a scare about being short one day, but I ended up just miscounting my register and was $0.03 over.) I'm even painfully slow at fronting and facing items on shelves. I ended up having to work a 14 hour day too. I ate some food at my break but I was also running off of no sleep.

Worst of all, last Friday, I was assigned to unloading the truck. I was slow at that too, like everything... plus I started getting increasingly winded and eventually could barely breath. I would have thrown up if I had eaten any breakfast or dinner the night before. I barely got halfway through before the assistant manager swapped me out to the register.

20 hours already feels like too much... and now because a new hire bailed, I'm going to get more hours this week. My boss and coworkers can't pity me for my performance forever, and I'll get fired if I don't have a mental breakdown and quit on my own. I couldn't only get about two hours of sleep tonight either.

I feel like a complete, abject failure. If I can't handle this, I probably can't handle any job. It's obvious why that person never wanted to be with me, I'm a perpetual child who can't support anyone.

SSRIs only made extremely apathetic and emotionally blunted but at the same time didn't help my anxiety at all - not even 1%. Vortioxetine was the same plus it gave me horrible stomach pain. Mirtazapine was the same, but also made me extremely lethargic. Wellbutrin at least helps a little with the amotivation and apathy, but it makes the anxiety a little worse as well.

depression,"TL;DR: My friend, who is a minor, is very depressed and is struggling with suicidal thoughts. She refuses to call any hotlines. She attempted suicide yesterday. What can I do as a friend to help her?

I'm 16 and my friend is 15. We live apart, and she still lives with her parents. My country is still in lockdown, although it's slowly opening up, but this whole thing has been hitting her hard.

Yesterday she told me she wanted to kill herself, and had been wanting to for a while. She had a panic attack through text after that, she couldn't breathe very well, and then she started feeling lightheaded and ""sleepy"". I told her to try and describe her surroundings and focus on her breathing while I asked her questions. It turned out she had eaten close to nothing the entire day, so after she calmed down I told her to go eat something more. She's had trouble keeping food down lately, so I told her to try to eat something liquid, like a soup, or just something light. I've yet to check up on her today, to see if she managed to eat something or not, and if she's feeling better, but I plan on doing so.



How can I help her? She refused to call a hotline yesterday, and she's, in general, shown a disregard for professional help. Is there any resource I could get her...? I really don't know anything. If you know any numbers that don't take personal information and don't act on it, then I'd really appreciate it. I'm in Portugal. Yesterday I spent the entire night searching but I couldn't find anything. She's been more alone at home lately, and I know that I might not always be there for her when she needs me.

I think she hasn't been taking care of herself lately, not eating enough, not taking her meds, getting little sleep, things like that. She jokes about it, and it's worrying me. Would it be patronizing of me to remind her...? She also drinks, and she takes hard meds. It worries me. She says she's been trying to cut on her drinking habit, but I don't really press it. Is it okay if I ask her about things like that?

If she feels suicidal again, is it okay if I ask her why she's feeling like that?

I'm not getting any help from mom and dad to pay for it but I know that they want to go to college, they don't care about my problem. this morning was made worst when I was trying to eat something before helping around the house and was yelled at for not doing the work right away.

this is normal and going on my whole life and years and years of it has killed my self-worth and honesty I don't why I should continue trying to stand up for myself when everything I saw is shot down. and school was awful with this going on to on top in was bullied too and again pairents didn't care about saying I should deal with myself and dress ""normally "" and hide my hobbies.  to this day I still do hide hobbies feel like im not loved anymore or until my life goes somewhere good, what the point of trying to fight when your self -worth feels like it was never there.

depression,"I have a 14 year old and an 11 year old girl.  The oldest has been hospitalized last month for attempting suicide.  She was diagnosed with depression but has since developed signs of anxiety, severe nightmares, ptsd, and has gotten an eating disorder.  She is attending a day center specifically designed to help with her eating disorder and her depression and she is on medication for her nightmares and her depression.  

Yesterday I got a call from the police where she had mentioned in therapy at the day center that she was sexually assaulted by an ex boyfriend.  I took her for a long drive to talk and she broke down and told me quite a bit.  She told me about her trauma and I was horrified.  She says she doesn't feel like she is getting better and she doesn't feel like she can.  She is such an empathetic person who always puts others needs above her own and always has.  She suffers so that others can be safe and happy.  

She told me yesterday that her sister has confided in her that she is depressed too.  I once thought that my kids told me everything, but now I see that I have no idea what they are going through and they don't want to confide in me, despite my attempts to tell them that they are safe and that I am here for them.  I want so much to help them, to keep them safe.  It feels like everything I do is not enough, or backfires.

I don't know if I'm actually depressed, but I feel guilty all the time for a reason that I don't feel like disclosing. Sometimes my head hurts so much. I can't even handle texts. This lockdown has created a huge toll on my mental health. I exercise regularly. I started meditating too. For a moment yesterday that everything was about to be okay, but it is the same today.

depression,"Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents. 

To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later) 

The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"". 
She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.

Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped.
Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")
 Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old.
Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!)
Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams.
Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses.
Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"".
Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.

And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story. 

Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house. 
But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.

I haven’t gone outside for fresh air in 3 days. 
I hate myself for not being able to accomplish a single thing on my to do list.
My poor husband puts up with it all. He’s supported me fully our entire 6 years together.
Cooking, cleaning, cheering me up when I need it or even just attempting to.
Today he snapped. I hadn’t left the bed once and when calling to ask what he wanted for dinner he muttered- “why can’t you be a better wife and just surprise me for once”. Those words shattered my heart to pieces.

He instantly called me back apologizing. To be fair he’s never snapped at me before, but wow did that sting. He’s the most productive person on the planet. Runs a business, active with charity groups, avid gym goer / social butterfly. And then there’s me- his “lazy” wife. He’s never called me lazy but I know he thinks it. He’s hinted at it so many times as some days I’m incapable of doing something as simple as cleaning the kitchen. He’s the son of 2 gourmet cooks so of course his food is amazing. He plates the food and goes the extra mile. Being depressed means just getting out of bed is a victory. Cooking something easy and putting it on regular plates. To him, it’s minimum effort, but to me it means I rallied to achieve it. When I’m in the midst of a depressive episode I already feel worthless and like I’m holding him back. Tonight just confirmed that. 

Edit: All of your kind words and support have truly touched me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me feel not alone.

2nd edit: I got laid off because of covid which is what triggered this episode. My husband is really supportive, but I’m just being hard on myself for not finding a new job already. I just feel like a failure and took it really hard as I left a job to accept a new position in March (terrible timing lol) only got to work there one week in person and then got laid off over zoom with all the other new hires 1.5 months later.

To start, I'd summarize my family background by saying I was diagnosed with ptsd as a result of it. That's kinda all I wanna go into there. Now we're here and I'm a college aged adult. 

Basically I feel like I've spent my whole life hurting and because of that I'm terrified of doing anything the might cause any person the slightest bit of harm. I'll obsess over it. Today, I accidentally cut a car in line at the drive thru. I felt like shit the entire time through the line that I left money to help pay for their order with an apology for cutting in line. I know that seems like the normal and good thing to do but I don't feel like I do it for the Right reasons. Not to be a good person and say sorry but to alieve my own stress because if I didn't say something then it'd bother me for who knows how long. 

Now take this situation and apply it to my friendships. I get so scared that I said or did something wrong at the drop of a hat. I'm sensitive to changes in tone and posture so I'll notice but not say anything. Then I let it fester and worry until my apology to that person, if the instance needs one, becomes more about me than them. We might arrive at the conclusion that our friendship is okay but I feel like I did something wrong still on a personal level. Of course, sometimes it's not ok though and they no longer want to remain in contact which I think is fair.

This leads to me internalizing and feeling like I'm in a cycle of being a bad person, a person who hurts people. Then I want to hurt myself because why live when you hurt other people? I can't cope with that. 

I don't know what's wrong with me or what to do about it. I've seen therapists actively, I'm not single (so I must not be The Worst Ever), I have great academics and do well at work.

A thought pops into my head. Will I ever be like those stars? That even though they have vanished millions of years ago they still light up the night sky? After my death, will I shine a light on what remains? Are we all here for a reason? One star calls my attention the most, the largest star.  Alone, without any other star close to it. They pop into my head, I can't help but smile. The star brings their memory to me. I remember all those ""I love you"" even the ones I did not utter. What I would give for 5 more minutes by their side. The cycle of life does not allow this. I thank God for every moment I had with you. Every laugh, every hug, every kiss. I hope to one day create that same impact. Tears begin to caress my face, with a breath I regain my composture. My dream is to one day find the same love you did. So strong that you death was only weeks apart. I hope you are ""the eternal love"" together. That love of which I have distanced myself and hope to return to one day, but most importantly I hope to have someone to share it with. My heart becomes filled with peace. ""She"" pops into my head. A feeling I have not allowed myself to feel in a long time overpowers me. I leave in the hands of God what must be. I do not know what the future holds but I hope ""she"" is in it. I silence my thoughts, I savor the night and hope to keep it in my memory forever. In the solitude of my roof, I realize I'm not alone, I am with myself. My true self, the me I wish the whole world could know, the me I wish ""she"" will get to know. I hope I'm good enough for her, even though I most likely haven't met ""her"" yet. I wonder what she must be doing while I right these words. Is ""she"" thinking what it would it be like to meet me, like i'm dying to meet her? Up until now I am sure I have done nothing to deserve her. I do not know how much is left for that destination, in the meantime I hope to enjoy the journey. The sun is beginning to rise, I hope this day brings wonderful things to her, things she can tell me about one day, just like I'll tell her about tonight.

 Heme aqui, viendo el cielo en la madrugada. Mi mente vacia, pero llena al mismo tiempo. Viendo las pocas estrellas que la ciudad me deja ver. Aunque probablemente esas estrellas ya no esten, su luz parpadeante aun llega a mis ojos. Asi como aquella estrella se desvanecio, su vida se acabo, asi acabara la mia. Una pregunta no se va mi cabeza. ¿me tocara ser como las estrellas? Que aun cuando ya murieron hace millones de años, aun alumbran el cielo nocturno. ¿Sera que yo también algun dia, mucho tiempo despues de mi muerte, tambien me toque alumbrar?¿Sera que realmente todos estamos aqui por una razon? Una estrella en particular cautiva mi atencion. La mas grande que puedo ver. Solitaria, sin alguna a su alrededor. Llegan a mi cabeza, no puedo evitar sonreir. La estrella me trae su recuerdo. Recuerdo todos los te quiero, los te amo hablados, y los no hablados. Lo que daría por 5 minutos a su lado. Pero el ciclo de la vida lo impide. Agradezco a Dios cada momento que me regalo con ustedes. Cada risa, cads abrazo, cada beso. Espero algun dia yo causar el mismo impacto. Las lagrimas empiezan a acariciar mi cara, con un suspiro recupero mi compostura. Mi mayor sueño ahora es encontrar el amor que ustedes tuvieron. Tan fuerte que su muerte solo tuvo semanas de separación. Ahora espero esten gozando juntos del amor eterno. El amor del que me he alejado y espero algun dia volver, pero mas que nads, tener con quien compartirlo. Mi corazón se llena de paz. Llega ella a mi cabeza, un sentimiento que no me he permitido sentir en mucho tiempo se apodera de mi. Dejo en manos de Dios lo que tenga que suceder. No se lo que me espera en el futuro, pero espero ella, sea cual sea su papel en el, si es que lo hay, este en el. Traigo silencio a mi mente por un rato, saboreo la noche y espero guardarla produndamente en mi memoria. Aqui en la soledad de mi techo, me doy cuenta que no estoy solo, estoy conmigo, mi verdadero yo, el yo que quisiera que el mundo conozca, el yo que aquella persona especial va a conocer. Espero ser lo suficientemente bueno para ella, y estoy consciente de que probablemente aun no la haya conocido. Me pregunto que estará haciendo mientras escribo estas palabras. ¿Estata pensando en como sera conocerme asi como yo muero por conocerla?

depression,"I'm new to this, and Reddit in general, but I'll try to put this in words. Basically, a while ago after a failed attempt at suicide, I just kinda made a promise to myself to never try it again because my mom had depression before me and I was afraid that If I succeeded she would try it too. I also have two little siblings and a few cousins living with me. So I know I won't or at least shouldn't try to kill myself again, but it feels like my body gets heavier every day. Like I know I have to survive and keep getting through this, but it physically hurts to stay here.

I'm already on meds and see a therapist occasionally, but It keeps getting worse.

Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better, and I try to believe it. It's probably true. But it's been years. And when I'm not just plain tired, I'm very irritable. I don't want to get mad for no reason- and for the most part I'm good with controlling my actions for it, but I hate being mad. I just realized I'm rambling. Oh well.

depression,"Growing up, I never quite understood why I wasn’t holding a parent’s hand, but my own. I looked up to see I’m right outside the house, like a stranger observing through a window and figuring out what this was, if this is what a family was supposed to look like. Whenever I’d enter, I am indifferent. The odd one out, both literally and figuratively, I was the fifth and the last. I was given away early on. I never truly knew what or who I was when I have lived all my life forcing myself to believe that I was needed, wanted. That my main job was to calm them down, to keep them smiling at me, and just stay out of their way. It’s embedded in me to not cry when no one else is crying or not be angry but be grateful instead, or stop questioning things when they’ve given you life. No one mentioned anything and that left me unprepared. Now that I’m an adult, it’s really hard to be honest about what’s inside of me — my feelings, my thoughts, my wants and needs, my own choices — just to know who I really am before they molded me into someone who always acts like nothing that happened ever hurt me.

People and things keep happening and they leave with parts of you that you’ll never get back. I tried getting perspective to keep myself sane, you know, to practice gratitude and kindness again and again towards the little things even to those who don’t deserve it. That never worked because I was just trying to by-pass grief. I knew grief too well, and in mourning, you numb yourself. You disconnect yourself. Maybe that’s why I love watching films. I always wanted to disconnect myself from reality, and hopefully, if an unexpected scene gives me a chance to cry about every tragic thing from it, then I could finally feel something and connect that to everything that has happened to me for at least a few seconds. Most of the time I’d just feel bad that I ended up not crying at all, and punish myself for being too vacant again.

I retreat once more because thinking about it makes you never want anything like that to happen again, but then it keeps happening right? Two decades in this world made me realize that you can mourn a loss that has or has never been yours. If you look at it in another way, it’s also a little life that’s ending. And it starts and ends again. I’ve been mourning the death of my youth for as long as I can remember, and I’m not even half of the way out of the lives I’ll try to exist to. I tried healing a lot of times. I turned to vices, to pleasure, to pain — both people and material things. I just wanted to love love. I had so much love in me I don't know where to put it to. Nothing seemed to work. I volunteered, did art, willingly gave it away, and every time I hoped it would boomerang. I kept asking why it never did nor lasted. Why can’t it happen right just this once?

Is there a greater word for exhaustion to describe this heavy cloud around me? I can't see through it. I can't just make it go away. I needed it to stop. At times, I bury my head into my pillow, suffocating myself so I could get my brain to process this. Not wanting to do or be *anything*. It's so hollow here that if my soul would scream into my ears, my body would just echo it back. Rarely there'd be a tiny light that burns to remind me more that I actually want to live, but I’m so scared of doing it that I don’t end up living at all. The cycle repeats. I am aware of this, and most would say that’s a start, but what do I do with *that*?","It's so hollow here that if my soul would scream into my ears, my body would just echo it back.",t3_gsoy0k,0

depression,"Sorry, this is a super super long post but other than my therapist I have nobody else to talk to about this and I haven’t been seeing her often. I don’t actually expect anyone to read everything. It’s just that I’m having one of those nights where I’m struggling to fall asleep. This is my 4am brain dump. 

When I was young my parents didn’t make a lot. Mom worked for minimum wage and dad didn’t make that much more but they saved so much just to give me more opportunities. I went for all kinds of classes to try things out (piano, swimming, art, skating, etc.) In school I did really well and was one of the top of my class every year. I’m an only child so anytime there was anything to be done around the house I would be the one to do it. Such as translating and taking care of important mail, sealing the driveway, repainting the window trims, mowing the lawn, shovelling the snow, installing light fixtures, repair of any item or electronics, fixing the fence, etc. I learned to do so much throughout the years so that I could help out my parents. 

Then came the end of high school where I started to get depressed and really bad anxiety. It was so bad I’d start crying in class in the middle of a lesson. It was super embarrassing but I couldn’t help it. The school social worker would meet up with me every week and further recommended a place for therapy. The people were nice but long story short I hated it because I felt like they thought I was crazy. My grades dropped and I couldn’t get into my top pick for university so had to settle for a different one. 

Skip to now and I’m supposed to be graduating university this year, except... I’m not. It was supposed to be my last year but my depression and anxiety have gotten so bad that I took a medical leave for the school year off. My friends, family, and boyfriend, to this day still don’t know about this... yes, I hid it from them since September 2019 and pretended to go to school. I really wanted to be honest and come clean but I couldn’t do it. Every week my therapist and I would work on building up enough courage to tell them and gave myself a deadline but it would keep getting pushed back. Now with the pandemic going on, it’s not suspicious that I’m not attending a graduation ceremony. 

I was prescribed Prozac almost a month ago but it hasn’t been helping (doctor said it takes time). If I could have it my way I would just leave this life. The pain I have to hide every day is so exhausting and becoming unbearable. The only thing keeping me here is my grandma. She helped raise me ever since I was born and she’s 90 now. I would take her out shopping, for food, help her shower and wash her hair, etc. My mom does a lot but I know she’s tired so I do the most that I can. My grandma is very dependent on me which I’m fine with because I love her so much. I know taking care of her doesn’t only mean physically but also an emotionally which is why I always talk to her and make sure she knows she’s loved. She would be really hurt if I were gone. 

I had so many opportunities growing up and my parents sacrificed so much for me, moving to a new country without knowing anything or even speak the language. From a young age it seemed like I was ahead of everyone and more mature since I had to grow up fast and help my family out with things around the house and in everyday life. Everyone mentioned how my future seemed so bright, yet here I am with no university degree, no job, no direction in life, no purpose. I’m always scared that what if this isn’t “high functioning depression” and that maybe I’m actually just a lazy fuck who is sad for no reason?? I know killing myself would hurt my family a lot but the pain and guilt just eats away at me every day and I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

In terms of suicidal thoughts they've definitely come up more frequently in the past few days than before. But, I just think about how my problems shouldn't feel like real problems.

But now I feel days go by and there’s nothing in for me but the money. I feel every day is the same, I am overloaded with things I don’t want to do, waking up too early (I get around 3 hours of sleep per day) and I have no friends, I don’t get any texts at all, and I love a guy who doesn’t, or will ever love me back.

Also, I have a lot of moments of feeling not real. Like, just fleeting moments, mostly, but every now and then it'll last longer. It doesn't really bother me, because I know it's pretty common with depression, but that lingering feeling is kind of uncomfortable.

Also, I just lose track of conversations a lot. I forget what I was saying or what the other person just said. It's getting irritating. I feel like I'm being rude, but it's not intentional.

The point is the privacy oe lack there of because my sister doesn't understand what that 8s apparently because she just kind of started to rummage through my stuff. And this is where I started to panick because at first it was just my shoes and stuff that I had left out and her making a mess. She who is older than me by the way and my younger sister who is like almost 4 started messing with my stuff abd managed to lose my hair brush which is hard because i dont have much in my room and there is a bed spring underneath my bed. It was just small stuff like that but then it turned to opening stuff. No big deal and then she went into my closet and i started go get nervous. And even now I am still shaking. See a while back i wrote this note to nobody in particular saying how i didn't know if I believed in an afterlife or something like that but that even if I did i had nobody waiting for me and maybe I could be the first and help everyone else. I hid this note in a box ontop of my book shelf which wasnt big. And she took the box down to look in it and i full on panicked and basically told her to get out and that she always does that because she does. And I could not tell her to get out before because my parents are always telling me how I am always rude to her and how i need to be nicer to her.

I'm a 23 yo guy with a lot of dreams and very passionate, I finished my master's degree in December 2019, and I've decided to move out to another country to pursue my dreams. I was in the midst of gathering the necessary papers and learning the language of the new country when this pandemic started and lockdown happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't bore you with the details, but long story short, everything stopped and I found myself sitting home doing nothing for the past 2 and half months. Every time the lockdown ends, they extend it another month or so and each time I get further away from my dreams and this has caused depression and anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was ok at first, but the last week was tough. It's like I've been traumatised. I'm scared, I'm questioning my existence. I don't find joy in anything I used to love. I don't feel like doing anything at all. I fear the night because, for some reason, those feelings intensify during the night and I struggle to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, I know this is mainly due to the situation and not being able to do a thing, but will I ever go back to my old nature? Will I get my interest in things back? my dreams and passion? is this going to stick around forever, or will it go away and how can I make it go away faster?

My dad’s job moved us to Detroit when I was six and all I can remember is that since that move everything went down hill. My relationship with my mother grew worse as the years went on, and although I wasn’t the perfect child or teen she did not give me much motivation by telling me I was doing chores and having friendships ‘wrong’. My dad since moving, because of the tense relationship between his side of the family and my mom, grew angrier and angrier. It even got to the point of if there wasn’t telling and screaming in the house I would shake to wait for it or even spur it to get it over with. But this was when I was in my teens. 

Now as a senior in college and more relationship experience to go on, my mom and dad have mellowed out anger wise. But their words are more vicious than ever. Unrelated, I started developing symptoms of depression and that leads to the major depressive disorder that I have today. Due to the world situation, being in a place a long time isn’t the best. 

So I give all this backstory to ask for help. I recently went through a major depressive episode two days ago. I couldn’t sleep or eat and all I could really do was just sit and stare at the wall for hours. Now I’m feeling a bit better, but I just had a talk with my dad. He said that he is sad too, which he has told me before, and that he gave up a life that he was leading (a bachelors lifestyle of going to the gym and looking good) for my mother and I. He said that it doesn’t help that his daughter is depressed and that he has to do the lawn chores, which I do regularly help with but not during my episode a couple days ago I will admit, and that he is on the brink of being done with my mother. 

I’m asking for help. I don’t know if he truly means to blame me. I wasn’t planned and my parents weren’t even married and my mother was supposed to not have kids on account of a condition. But when he talks about the past he lights up. Then when he gets into his life and profession, he spits disappointment.

depression,"I don’t really need any advice, but I need to get this of my chest. I’ve struggled with undiagnosed depression for about the last 5 years. Last summer I went through a bad breakup (due to me being depressed and not meeting their needs), moved out from living with my roommates, and started living by myself in an apartment. I had no friends and saw nobody all day. All I did was work. By the time I started to feel better and started hiking and exercising again, it was almost winter and seasonal depression started kicking in. Finally around the end of January I got some motivation back, started exercising again, and would go hiking on my days off when I could drive over where there was no snow. Then at the beginning of February, I wake up in the hospital.

I had worked all night, drove my coworker home and had just left his place. I was told that about a block after dropping him off, someone had fallen asleep at the wheel and T-boned me going about 50 mph in the middle of the city. I still don’t remember a thing. I had a pretty bad concussion, fractured 5 ribs, had a punctured lung, and fucked up my knee somehow. I stayed in the hospital overnight but was released the next day. 

Since I’m a waitress, I obviously wouldn’t be able to work until my ribs were healed, which I was told was going to be 4-6 weeks. I’m a fairly active person and I hate sitting still, so that was going to be hell, but doable. I was in a ton of pain, and my knee hurt worse than my broken ribs, even though the x-rays didn’t find anything. But I figured it would get better with time.

Finally 4 weeks after my accident, with my knee still hurting terribly and not being able to straighten, my doctor ordered an MRI. Two weeks later, I met with an orthopedic surgeon, who told me that I sprained a ligament, had a bone bruise, had a huge amount of cartilage chipped away almost to the bone, and had torn my meniscus-which would need surgery or else I would never be able to straighten my leg again. Luckily, I was able to get surgery scheduled for 2 days later since most elective surgeries had been cancelled (the only good thing to come from the coronavirus).

The surgery went well, but I was in a ton of pain and was stuck in a brace and on crutches for 6 weeks. I could do all of my own basic care but couldn’t make my own food or even reach my foot to put on my socks. Luckily I had moved in with my sister and another roommate a couple weeks before my accident so I was not alone. But I still hated having to be taken care of and not being able to do anything.

Quarantine didn’t help with this at all. I just kept thinking about how much hiking I could be doing or that I could be playing tennis, and I didn’t have any friends to talk to even if there wasn’t a quarantine. I had nothing to do for 6 weeks other than watch Netflix or play video games, which I get bored of very easily. All I could do was think about how terrible my life was and that I may never be able to play tennis again and I’m only 22, and that it was someone else’s fault. I’ve also gained a lot of weight due to not being active and stress eating, so that makes me feel even worse about myself and have lower self confidence than usual.

When the 6 weeks were up and I could finally walk again, my life was starting to turn around. I could make my own sandwiches (Small victories)! Walking was more difficult than I thought it would be because I lost a lot of muscle in my leg, but I made improvements and a week ago I walked 5 miles with very minimal pain. 

But within the last few days, my knee has been very painful. It was right around one of my incisions, so I passed it off as scar tissue blocking my knee and getting caught. I had an appointment with my surgeon two days ago, and it turns out that it’s probably not scar tissue, and he thinks I re-tore my meniscus. 

I only just scheduled another MRI, so I have no idea whether or not it is torn, but I can’t help but feel the worst outcome is going to happen. The pain does not feel normal, and it feels like I’m going backwards. I do not want to get surgery again, when I’m already almost back to normal. I feel like every time I get back up something bad happens and I go back to square one. If I got the surgery again, I’d have to be on crutches for 6 more weeks again, and go through all the same stuff in PT. 

I obviously want my knee to get better so that I can be active again, because that’s my only real way of coping with stress and making me happy. It just sucks that I can’t do the things that make me feel better, so I’m spiraling downward. I know this is just temporary, but there’s also the possibility that I’ll never be able to play tennis, run, or do other things again. And that thought just kills me and I don’t know what I would do if that happened. I also don’t know how to lose weight when I can’t do anything active, and because I’m gaining weight, I feel like shit about myself all the time. I’m not suicidal and I could never do that to my family, but I can’t help thinking about how easy it would’ve been to just die in the car crash.",My Life Sucks,t3_gspmwr,0

depression,"I often ask my friends who are struggling with depression and anxiety: ""Are you getting stronger?""

A response I often get is, ""Yes… but…"" - and that's where I proceed to cut them off.

When you're going through mental health, it's often easy to forget just how far you've come. How much you've made an effort to face the day despite your personal fabric feeling disintegrated due to the crippling effects of mental issues. There are no buts. Are you getting stronger? Yes. Take that as a win.

Give yourself credit where credit is due. It's so easy to desire to be in a better place than where we are today. It's dangerously futile to keep chasing a goal that continues to get further and further away from you. Feeling a tad anxious about that? Don't be - the only reason a goal is getting further and further away is because you're getting stronger and stronger. Day by day. As you get stronger, it is only natural for your desired baseline to be further away. And plus, this gives you more room to continue to grow into a better individual that you have the capacity to become.

It's hard, don't get me wrong. And yes, cutting off people before they continue on with their ""Yes… but…."" is quite harsh but I truly do mean this from a good place. I want us to recognise that saying yes to getting stronger is a win. That's it. That's all you can ask for, perhaps at this stage in your progress.

Give yourself some time, give yourself some admiration for your audacity to have the courage to face the day. Inheriting whatever mental demons within us aren't something that we asked for. They're the cards that we've been dealt and now we're just doing our best to play the best strategy possible.

Perhaps, just perhaps, a good strategy is recognising the successes of the day by day - take this as a win.

Since the beginning of quarantine, the hopelessness of never truly knowing when I will see him again is killing me. My fiance and I are long distance. We had planned to visit in May so my parents can meet his and we could look at wedding venues. Well that didn't happen due to the virus shit. Now I may not even see him in July when we were supposed to go on an annual vacation with my family. 

Sometimes the sadness of never seeing him again makes me break down and just cry, telling him how much I love and miss him and how I hate all of what is going on. But recently, i feel like i can't cry. I get sad yeah but i just can't cry and it frustrates me. Shouldn't I be crying if I'm sad or am I just too depressed to even try to show emotion?

My fiance has during my breakdowns been reminiscing and reminding me of how we got together, how since we've been together our lives have become better, that though I don't feel love that I still show it in other ways, that he knows I love him and understands that I'm struggling right now. 

I just.. I'm wanting to feel those feelings again, and feel the love again from him that I know is there but I push away, I push him away, but he doesn't plan on leaving me no matter what, he's committed to staying by my side and supporting forever which is a comfort but I feel like I'll be burdening him, he could find someone better who could actually show him all the love he deserves. I love him but god it's so hard to feel it or even try to create things to show him I love him, I've been trying to crochet and cross stitch with the intention of giving them as gifts to him but everytime I try to continue with them, I just wonder like what's the point?

I have had a lot of adverse situations in my past. I was sexually exploited when I was around six. I lost my best friend when I was around thirteen. My father was diagnosed with cancer at around the same time. 

After a few years, when I was sixteen, something magical happened to me. I found another friend. A girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever known. Eventually, I developed feelings for her. And she did too. Problem is, her parents were...conservative. They didn’t like the idea of romance. So, they barred me from her. Now, she is deathly scared if she receives even a text from me.

I miss her a lot. A few months ago, I started seeing a therapist. Doc said ‘She was a plug for your overflowing emotions. Now that she’s gone, your mind is in the void again.’

What do I miss? Kissing her. Holding her as near to me as possible. Laughing with her over things. Talking about philosophy, and then immediately shifting the topic to The Office.

depression,"Um hi. I'm kinda new to Reddit, and this is actually my first post so I hope I'm doing this right. I'm sorry in advance if this post turns out to be me being dramatic. So, I'm a 14 years old girl and I was born in China and moved to the US at age 3. I'm a divorce child, and I haven't seen my biological father in years, and I'm fine with that. But because of that, I've used to go to therapy for 9 years old. I've stopped about 2 years ago. So from the beginning, I've been used to my parents yelling and stuff. Because of this, I have also moved to 7 different schools and 5 different times. After the divorce, I saw my dad kick my mom after showing up to her workspace. They've called the police on each other twice. They really hated each other, and I started to hate my dad more and more since he would always subtlely tell me to hurt my mom. Once I was in a Chinese New Year Festival with him and he bought me a confetti cannon. I pointed out there was a warning label to not point it at a person's face, and when we got home, he told me to shoot it at my mom. I did not. Soon, my mom met and was engaged to another man (let's call him Dan) and for the first few years moving in with him, he was awesome. We were an actual family. Of course, there were bad days, but it was light and things were always resolved quickly. I haven't heard of my biological father for a long time, and I was finally locked down in a school where I had a group of awesome friends. I was still pretty young, so I was really happy. But then things started to change. My parents decided they wanted a baby, which was awesome and I got a baby brother. He's really cute, but I think me and him, as well as the pressure of debt, stressed both our parents to change. We moved to another state away from my first ever real friends and they told me to suck it up and make new ones. I was in 6th grade at this time. This was one of the harder times for me. I became sadder, and my parent grew more irritated with me. I still don't know what happened, but I guess it was my fault for it. Soon, I got into more fights with my parents and started to just stay in my room. I feel like my mom was always stricter and less emotional than others. She always told me ""crying is for losers"" so she would always get mad at me for crying. Dan didn't really help me and often did nothing. I couldn't even cry in my room because my mom would say she would hit me if I didn't shut up. Me and my mom would fight about even the littlest things. Some examples are:

\- On multiple occasions, when I'm feeling extra down and my mom said, ""What's wrong with you?"" in a cold tone and tell me there's nothing to be sad about.

\-Said I was ugly many times because I was self-conscious of my looks.

\-Said I walked like a duck and like a man

\-Recently I wanted bangs and asked my mom about it, and she said I would look ugly and disgusting with them. Then she decides to cut my hair and when I asked bangs again, she cut a big chunk of my front hair. It was terrible and I was crying saying how I was going to get bullied in school. She laughed in front of me when I said I was going to get bullied.

\-Curse at me all the time on the simplest mistakes. If I accidentally spill juice, she will call me a fucking asshole and stupid. Those are just some of the words she would say. To this day, there hasn't been a day where I wasn't cursed at.

\-When I started cutting myself, my mom screamed and cursed at me, threatening she was going to send me to a madhouse multiple times.

\-Once I had a suicidal panic attack, and I was on the floor crying with a knife. She started yelling at me, screaming ""fuck you!"" When I told her I wanted to kill myself, she said ""Do it! Fucking do it! Go kill yourself!"" and stormed upstairs leaving me alone crying. This stuck with me.

\-When I asked my mom to be more compassionate and that she was hurting my feelings, she gave me the silent treatment for multiple days.

\-Multiple times when she was mad at me and I was crying, she curved her hands out like she wanted to choke me and said ""I want to kill you right now"".

\-Once she hit me with a wooden comb on the leg, leaving a mark.

\-She told me I was ""just like my father ""so many times, knowing that I knew she hated him. Also threatened me that she would send me back to his house(which was in another state).

\-Insulted me a lot. ""You're a fucking disgrace"", ""You asshole""

\-Told me multiple times that I made her want to kill herself and I was the reason she was going to die young.(this also stuck to me)

\-Laughed and rejected my plea for another therapist saying I was fine

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some I could think of right now. I really don't if it is my fault they're like this because they blame me for it. She gets mad easily. Yesterday, I asked if I could make ice cream sandwiches, and she just glared at me and said: ""are you fucking kidding me?"" My baby brother was with her a wanted to make them when I mention it, and my mom said that I was brainwashing him into doing what I wanted. She gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the day, She just ignored me and ignored my existence basically.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to Dan, my step-dad.  Now for this, I don't know if it's true, but I feel like he likes my baby brother more since he is actually his son. He's 5 now and a little devil lol, but we have good times together. I know he's just 5, but sometimes I just feel like Dan blames me for everything and never my brother. Here's what I mean:

\-My parent overly spoils him. I guess this is me being jealous, but my little bro thinks he could do whatever he wants. He shoots me with his nerf guns at close ranges, kicks me, and once, he even bit me so hard, he almost ripped my skin off. Whenever I complain about him to my parents, they would only say ""He's a baby, of course, he will do that. Your 13/14 years old, suck it up."" But the thing is, when my bro does the same thing to my parents, they will go beserk. Start cursing him out too and put him in time out. If he did the same to me, they would tell me I was a baby.

\-Dan would assume and blame me for things I haven't done. Once I was with my bro, and he got hurt because he watching where he was going and hit his head, and start crying. Dan would automatically assume that I hit him it something and yell ""Get the fuck away"" or ""Did you fucking hit him, you dumbass?""

\-Sometimes I would joke around or ask my parents a question only to have them call me stupid or tell me to shut up. That's why I never really talk to them about stuff.

\-His nicknames for me is ""knucklehead"", ""scumbag"", or ""dummy"".

\-When I say to him I was emotionally stressed and upset, he would say ""Oh grow the fuck up"".

\-Both my parents curse at me so much that my now 5-year-old brother starts calling me a ""stupid ass"" and my parent would laugh with him. 

\-Little mistakes that I did would end up me getting yelled at for being stupid and useless.

  
Again these are just some of the things I can remember off the bat. And although I'm mostly the one they are angry at, they sometimes curse and yell at my brother too. Another thing is if my parents are mad at my brother, they would be mad at me too even though I did nothing wrong. BUT if they were mad at me, they would not be mad at my brother. I know they talk behind my back, I'm not stupid. When I'm in my room after dinner, sometimes I can hear them talk about me and laugh. They're also not that supportive of my hobbies. I'm learning Korean, Japanese, and Chinese as a hobby, and they both tell me its stupid even though they know I'm so passionate about it. They judge my friends even though my friends are more compassionate than them. When I tell them that, they say that family is more important. Once, I got money for Christmas, and I decided to spend my gift card on amazon, my mom wouldn't stop complaining about me wasting my money and said that she wouldn't provide for me anymore and to buy my own stuff. (Note I was 13 with no job or allowance). For my grades, my parents weren't happy when I got a 91% average for ELA. 

My parents aren't the worst parents. They buy me stuff and provide for me and make delicious food for the family. But I wouldn't call them the best, either. Honestly, I'm scared of them to the point I'm kinda paranoid even when I'm not around them. I've memorized and learned their footstep sounds and how hard they stomp to decipher if they're mad or not. At school, I'm always scared of going homes because occasionally my mom would barge into my room for no reason when I'm away and always find something she didn't like. Even, when I'm hanging out with friends, I'm always at a lookout for a red Mazda car because I'm scared it could be my parent. I'm also scared of loud noises like a hairdryer or vacuum, but I don't know if it was because of them. When I'm with my friends, I'm always scared I did something wrong and that they actually didn't want to be my friends and were fake. When my parent calls me to them, I'm always scared if I did something wrong. 

When I see TV shows, movies, or videos of families, they always look happy and nice. They joke around, hug, and say I love you to each other a lot. My family never does that. But I don't know. Am I being dramatic? Is this normal for families or not? Am I the cause of this? Please help me. I really don't know what's right or wrong here or if I'm being whiny and sensitive to this. It's gotten to the point where I don't know if I'm actually depressed and anxious or looking for attention. Am I the bad one here? 

Thank you for reading all of this and I understand if I'm the problem here. I just really wanted to get it all out and find out the truth. Please help me, I really want to know if this is normal and what to do. Again, sorry for making this long, and I appreciate any advice from you guys. Thank you again.",Please help me!

But then I can’t make myself do it. I tell myself that if I just try a little and work to improve my portfolio I’ll be able to find a job, and then I can move on and be happy again. But I just play video games instead.

I want to have somewhere that's mine: a garden to plant my plants in, and where my cat can go outside and run around. I just don't get paid enough, my wife doesn't either. 

We decided to not have kids because neither of us have ever made enough money to realistically afford the out of pocket expenses that come with raising children. Among many other reasons: (the world generally going to shit also seemed unethical). 

So the house is really important. It would be a constant project, something that we can make our own, and grow in. Instead of throwing away thousands of dollars a month in rent for nothing to some jerk landlord who doesn't give a shit if the pipes leak all the time, or overcharges for parking. 

But it hit me today that just when we might be able to save some money: the economy tanks, one of us gets laid off, we need to pay for my medical treatments (epilepsy and melanoma yay) or something else. We just won't ever be able to.

I have had therapy for a year and a half or something, but it was like one appointment every 4 weeks until I was transferred to another therapist where I had an appointment every week. I went to the first therapist, because of self-harm and when I finally had the guts to tell my mother about it, she suggested I see one, I was fine with it. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, at that point I had been cutting for over a year (it isn't that long, i know), but one of the reasons I was cutting was because I was so lonely and it made me feel much worse than I already was. But by the time he had diagnosed me and transferred me to another therapist I had found new friends, I didn't have any friends for years before that, so it was a huge change in my life for me. I started going outside and I felt better for the first time in a long time, so after a few weeks with the new therapist I wanted to stop the therapy.

One of the main reasons was because I didn't want to drive almost an hour every week to go to therapy when I could've been outside with friends, but the main reason was because she brought up alcohol and it made too uncomfortable (I had my first ever drink when I was 11, but i only started to drink regularly when I was 13 or 14), I didn't realize it at the time though. I did a last test, she told me my results indicate I should continue therapy, but if I really wanted to stop I could.

That was about one and a half years ago, I have been better in general, but the last 6 months espacially my depressive episodes have been getting worse again and I think I have also developed a serious alcohol problem in the last two years (at least I think I drink too much and every online test told I'm at a dangerous level of alcohol consumption). I am pretty sure that I drink a lot, because of depression and the drinking then also causes depressive episodes.

I have been thinking about going back to a therapist, but I am not 18 yet, so I think I would have to tell my parents one way or another, but I really do not want to have to tell my mother something like that again. The last time the look on her face devastated me and I really don't want to cause her any pain and I don't want her to worry too much about me.

Should I just wait till I am 18 to go to a therapist on my own? Should I just go now without telling my parents? Or do you have another idea?

I move so slowly that my chest hurts or my breathing fluctuates suddenly time to time. I gave my heart to everyone I've known, only to be betrayed and emotionally abused. The only one I can seek refuge to is my boyfriend. However, I feel so much guilt putting all of my emotional burdens on him.

Recently, I left my band because of toxic relations with my drummer. I was in that band for 5 years, all the hard work I invested and hoped for, only to end violently. I had a teaching job, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought. I taught music for the first year, but the shortcomings of the US education system put me in the bottom of the barrel. I worked in public areas or shared classrooms, was promised to have enough supplies to teach but barely made my own materials, angered students in that I couldn't provide practical musical instruments, and was terminated by my school district. They didn't mention why, but my assumption is that I was not fit as a practical teacher working in their conditional settings.

My parents are very emotionally and verbally abusive. They assumed that some of my behaviors was because of the people I hanged out with or that my issues stemmed from not listening to my parents. In reality, I did nothing wrong. They're the ones that guided me to do teaching because they don't believe in my talents as a musician in a band. Even when I'm terminated, they told me to go back in working in education, no matter how much money it will take. To be honest, I'm too burned out to go back to school, and my experience as a teacher was so terrible that I do not want to pursue it anymore. Also, for years, I have so much resentment towards my parents, to the point where I can't even tell them I love them. They are cold, insensitive, and unloving people. I got more affection from crying with a pillow than I ever would from them.

At this moment, I share a room with my boyfriend in a house. It is crowded and full of bugs but it's doable for now. I am unemployed and seeking musical opportunities. My relations with my friends are so chaotic and full of drama that I erased all of my social media. I'm planning to change my phone number and fall out of existence.

We talk and text everyday for months. Plan for me to come visit in June. I start to notice a change in the last week or so. Our relationship feels more friendly then flirty. I catch him recapping his weekend and his wife comes up more often. He keeps talking about a show I should watch. He says ""We watch it every night"". He never spent time with ""we"" at night. So, because I care, I say ""I think we should do this. I think we should cancel our trip and I think we should consider being friends. I think you're falling back in love with your wife and marriage is going well. That's a good thing. I don't want you to feel like you need to carry on with me unnecessarily."" He paused and then said he's been really torn. I told him not to feel bad for having an improved marriage.

I already knew why it improved, I wanted to know if he knew why. So I asked him. He said he thought she had been seeing someone. I laughed and said ""No, that's not why."" So he asked me why I thought so. I told him for the last several months he's had an outlet to talk to about things he can't with her or anyone else really because his family is so tight knit. So he gets all this off his chest and when he gets home, he's a much nicer, more relaxed, happier version of himself. That's why she likes him more and is paying him more attention. I told him to waste no time and seize the moment to be a good husband. Buy her flowers, kiss her on the cheek and tell her you love her.

After we hung up. I cried. I cried so hard. I wanted him to bring me flowers, kiss me on the cheek and tell me he loved me. I told him what I wanted. And she's going to get it. Never in a million years did I think my attempt at having this affair, just this one little thing for myself, would backfire and improve my cheaters marriage.

I haven't had many things in my life that were just for me. Not even a few. Every time I try to seek out just a tiny bit of happiness, it's like the world or God or whatever tells me ""No, no, remember, you aren't that kind of person that gets those things. You get the fucked up life. Don't forget what you were born into and raised with and moved out into and so on. You don't get nice happy things. You only get fucked up things that break your heart, or what's left of it. You really should have learned by now to stop seeking happiness. It's only going to shatter what's left of you. Give it up.""",I just wanted one thing for myself...,t3_gsnko7,0

depression,"so before all this, around August and September of 2019, my life was great. I was on a weight loss thing, i was supported, i had an amazing best friend who I loved, I took up a martial art and I loved life and myself. 


Fast forward to now. I'm writing this in bed. All the weight i lost has been put back on. My ""best friend"" has practically left me, taking my heart with her. She isn't there for me anymore. My martial arts club is closed and I can't motivate myself to do any of the challenges they set. And all the while I'm just laid in bed without hope. Bored senseless. It's torturous and soul sucking. I don't feel loved anymore. 

TL:DR I feel like crying because I had the world, I used to be so happy and positive and now i can hardly smile. My life has gone to shit and nobody checks up on me. My bestie is gone and now i feel so neglected. Days just go by and i'm just wasting away. I spend my days like a dead body decomposing.

depression,"I’ve always seemed to have been dealt the worst card in the deck or atleast it feels that way. When I was in high school my mom passed away of cancer, that was 9 years ago so that doesn’t bother me the way it used to, time heals yada yada. The one thing that has come from that is that I crave affection, I feel empty when I’m single which is probably either normal or weird, I don’t know. 3 years ago a relationship I valued ended because we started to grow and think about what was next, I wanted a family she didn’t. That sucked but neither of us would be happy so it was for the best. I proceeded to enjoy the freedoms of being single and casually dated off and on no big deal but then 2019 happened.

 I worked with a girl named A she was cool and I really enjoyed her company so we started hanging out outside of work, I found out she gave up her baby for adoption and I respected that ( I already knew cause workplace drama when a pregnant lady goes missing and comes back not talking about her baby you know something must have happened.) I took it slow, did the right things, but she chose to sleep with another dude in a different department like I wouldn’t find out and she tried to get me fired when I called her out for cheating (I’m well liked so she had 0 shot at succeeding. In a hilarious plot twist, she got hit by a forklift and I was THE ONLY witness so I lied and said she walked out in front of the guy. When she got sent out for a drug test she found out she was pregnant again with the other dude. Eventually she quit when the whole department turned on her for being a hoe.) 

I met another girl at work during this time and her name was K. I was hurt by A’s actions and I really let me guard down with K, I let her in and she was classy, smart, and I genuinely trusted her, I started to fall for her but Then she broke up with me with this classic line that really bothers me, “You didn’t do anything, I’m the asshole, you’re a great guy, I’m sorry.” I found out she left me for her ex. I’m broken, I was screwed over twice, I feel robbed, I didn’t do anything to either of them but it was totally okay to rip my heart out like I didn’t even matter. I found out through K’s mom’s friend at work that K’s dad passed away and I reached out cause even though she doesn’t care about me, I don’t want her to quit schooling or her sister to go off the deep end. It felt like the right thing to do. Why do I give a shit about people who gave 0 about me? I don’t expect a response, why should she? It really hurts that even when you do the right things, treat people the way you want them to treat you and it all just gets spit back in your face. 

I just want the relationship that I had ripped out from under me but I don’t think there will ever be a next one. It feels like I’m just stuck here in this house alone, I have a roommate but they don’t get this feeling. To everyone else it’s not a big deal but for me it’s a huge deal, being in a relationship matters to me, it means life is moving forward and I’m taking the steps to get to the end goal of a family, you can’t get there by sitting alone.

You get up at a reasonable time, make yourself a nutritious breakfast, work out and try to convince yourself that you're having such a good day. And none of it works.

It feels like you deserve that emotional payoff, doesn't it? But for the majority of your day you feel like shit. You may feel like bursting into tears randomly, or go hours without feeling anything at all.

Even when I’m “happy” I look at fucking fruit and wonder how many apple seeds it would take to kill me (if you didn’t know there’s cyanide in apple seeds).

I called my GP again because this appointment pushed me down even further. She found another psychiatrist with whom I'll have an appointment next Wednesday.

Even though the last weeks were hell, I feel ok right now. No nervous breakdowns over simple things, no crying, not as much self-hatred and suicidal thoughts like I had in the last weeks. 

I'm so afraid of the new appointment. I'm afraid that this psychiatrist won't believe me, like the last one. I'm afraid that my symptoms won't show up until then and I'll appear as if I'm faking.

But i know this feeling will eventually be back and just knowing that makes me not want to be around for it anymore. I keep trying to push the thoughts away and for a while ive been successful. Recently its been so bad that im starting to make a plan. So im desperately searching for something that might be able to help me. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",Help with Suicidal thoughts,t3_gsk8vg,0
depression,"I've got  so many fucking thoughts,

With not many words to say,

Many jumbled up cloudy emotions,

for no heart to feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten real messed up

Far from the innocent child

going on tangents constantly in my mind

This life has gotten difficult to live

Maybe Im still a child

&amp;#x200B;

My conscious started fading

my mind started giving up

There are so many things I concentrate on,

with not much I grasp.

My thought process ping pongs,

Between many different topics,

At the end of the day I get tired of all the bullshit

because I think so much about what others think, what my actions mean

It's hard to get of feeling there for what is important to feel, and what is REAL

&amp;#x200B;

I hate people with all my heart,

For being so fucking big mouthed, careless, un-emphatetic using others-only caring about their own gains

hypocritic piece of shits

All the trash comes out of their mouth which they don't always mean,

Just because It's so fucking hard of them to think about another human beings feelings, other than themselves, well maybe they don't REALLY 

have feelings, I don't know cuz Im not them.

PARENTS

WHY ARE THEY PARENTS IF THEY DONT REALLY GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT HOW THEIR CHILD REALLY FEELS

THEY ARE CLEARLY AT AN IMPRESSIONABLE AGE AND THEY ARE CLEARLY SUFFERING,

 'WELL YOU CAN ONLY SOLVE THIS YOURSELF'

WHAT IF THERE'S NO SOLUTION?

WHAT IF THERE'S NO REAL ANSWER?

WHAT IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE FUCKED UP? YOU ARE IN THE WRONG, YOU OVETHINK BUT YOU CAN'T

CHANGE IT

IS IT OKAY TO SUFFER WITH THIS MEANINGLESS LIFE WHERE YOU WAKE UP EVERYDAY FEELING ALMOST NO HAPPINESS? WISHING YOU WOULD DIE

BUT CONTINUE ON JUST BECAUSE OTHERS SAY IT'S NOT OKAY TO KILL YOURSELF

AND

IN THE END

MAYBE YOU ARE TOO SCARED AND MASOCHISTIC TO KILL YOURSELF

depression,"This isn't a post aimed at getting anyone to sympathize with me, but moreso me seeking answers of some sort.

It's no secret at this point that our society is home to an increasingly suicidal population. And honestly, it's not hard to see why. Society and life in general is goddamn stressful and it's stopped being enjoyable a loooong time ago. We get out of our bed because it's routine, not because we eagerly await what goodies those gold-hearted politicians and corporates have in store for us. Society has stopped being enjoyable for me as a result of this. The highs don't outweigh the lows and I'm tired of constantly competing so hard in something I barely care about anymore.

This was a sentiment that a friend of mine in 2018 used to have. He was tired of being stuck in the same societal cycle he loathed so much and he made it no secret with me. At one point he told me that he was disowned by his family because he didn't want to share their religion and wanted to let me know, in case he needed a place to crash out at because the possibility of him getting kicked out was very real. He mentioned having suicidal thoughts and I went through the usual process of trying to talk him out of it. Then, after a bit of back and forth, he shared this somewhat enigmatic story that I would remember two years later. (Note: the quote below is somewhat paraphrased as I don't remember exactly what happened).

(By the way, DBD is short for Dead by Daylight, a video game this guy used to enjoy)

&gt;""I used to play DBD with 3 other people who really wanted me around to play the game with them. It was fun at first, but eventually I got tired of DBD. I got tired of its monotony, I got tired of the idiotic decisions the people in charge kept making, I got tired of the constant issues that plague the game, and I got tired of the toxicity and how hateful the community has gotten. I even got tired of my team to an extent as they expected more and more out of me. The game wasn't fun for me anymore.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I told my group I was leaving. I didn't want to play anymore. I wanted to leave that toxic environment and I wanted to leave the game I stopped enjoying.  
&gt;  
&gt;They tried to get me to stay. They told me that there was still so much to await in DBD, that it was too early in the game for him to leave, that they promised it would get better in the future. It didn't matter. I didn't care what was in store for the future, I just plain and simple stopped enjoying the game. When that didn't work, they took on a slightly more vitrolic tone and said that he was selfish for leaving, that he was intruding their happiness by taking an action that would benefit him and him alone, and that regardless of his enjoyment, that he should stick around so he could make others happy.  
&gt;  
&gt;It definitely made me feel guilty. If they were trying to guilt-trip me, they definitely succeeded. It made the decision harder to make. Eventually though, I told them this. If you can't play the game without me, you shouldn't have me. This dependence on me you have is unhealthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know if my selfishness was warranted there. Maybe I should have stuck around as they asked. Maybe I should stop caring about my own happiness as they wanted me to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;So that's why question here is, am I the asshole for supposedly being selfish as they claimed, for prioritizing my own happiness over theirs? And if so, do you think I am obligated to stick around in something I clearly don't enjoy simply because other people demand it? Do you think I'm obligated to participate in something I hate simply because other people demand it?""

I didn't understand. I told him, ""I still don't see what this has to do with your current situation."" (I really wasn't very bright back in the day.)

He gave me an inscrutable expression, then said, ""Maybe one day you will.""

I haven't heard from him since. I think he might be in the Canadian armed forces, but I can't be sure. He hasn't responded to any attempts to communicate with him.

This was two weeks before graduation, in 2018. Now two years later, in 2020, I'm finding myself in a similarly hopeless situation, where I too am running out of reasons to keep persevering for something I hate so goddamn much.

I'm not going to get into it. This isn't the post for that, it's largely irrelevant to the purpose of this post. I will say, though, that the day has indeed come where I now understand what my friend was talking about. I now understand why my friend told me all that.

And I already know the whole song and dance with this whole shtick. How suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem (as if society being incredibly exploitative and hateful is a ""temporary problem"", as if me getting tired of participating in said exploitative society is a ""temporary problem"", and as if that's somehow a bad thing in the first place), how I'm apparently selfish for even considering it (but isn't it selfish to demand people to participate in something they hate for the pleasure of others?), how apparently it ""gets better"" (what if such a promise doesn't change the fact that I no longer want to participate anyways?) and how apparently I'm an awful person for trying to supposedly justify suicide or even thinking about it in the first place. Hell is where I belong I guess, but isn't that a fitting place for someone as hopelessly selfish as I am? It's not much different from Earth. No better therapy for suicidal tendencies than Hell I suppose.

So where am I going with this? What's the point of this entire post? Well, it's mainly for me to ask this question.

If someone gets sick of participating in society and life, then why should we try to convince them or force them to stick around? Why should we try to force someone to participate in something if they very clearly don't enjoy it?

If that's the way they want to carry out their life, I'm not their mother. I can't force them to act a certain way just because I think I have the authority to tell them what to do. No one has that the authority to tell him how to manage his life except for him and him alone.

So why are we so adamant about this? If someone got sick of participating in something, why do we keep trying to force them to stick around anyways?",Searching for Answers,t3_gsk571,0

depression,"I work for a bpo company and recently, we got reprofiled because my original account laid off employees (including me). We are offered by the company to transfer to a different account, but it can only accommodate work from home setup.

The catch is I'm only bedspacing at an apartment, and the company will have to provide a PC for work. I don't have space to lug the machine, the stairs are my only option for me to set up. I also need to take calls during graveyard shift when all my housemates are asleep. My landlady refused my request for this.

I offered to work onsite, risk going out and go to work so I can prevent inconveniencing my housemates, but the account is not open with the idea.

I'm desperate, anxious and confused. I thought this year would be better, since I don't have a job last year. I worked hard to obtain my job now but because of the pandemic and these events, I don't know how to proceed.

I feel guilty that I didn't accept my old account's offer to work onsite during the first few weeks of lockdown here in our country. My thinking before is that I can't risk going out even though I get fully paid salary, because it's still not enough to cover medical expenses if I will be admitted to the hospital if ever I'll be infected with the virus.

depression,"*** I originally posted this on another group, but I realize it was the wrong group. Sorry if this is the second time you see this... ***

First, I want to say, I think there are plenty of teenagers and other young people on this forum who are hurting badly because of external life circumstances or not having found their way in life yet. If that is you, obviously you should seek help without delay, as far as professional counselling, medication, etc. This post is not directed at these people, aware as I am of their very real current struggle.

I believe there is depression, and then there is Depression with a big ""D"". To society at large, depression being a fairly new subject that is being talked about, it's always just ""depression"". But it's like heart disease: it can go from being minor with small, reversible consequences to being permanent, incurable, and life-threatening.

I am 33 years old (man). Relatively speaking, I have a lot of the things people could want in life. I work in health, I make very decent money, I am over 6 feet, rather good looking, I am athletic and talented at many sports, I am trilingual, and I have a supportive family.

And yet, I suffer immensely. For twenty years, I've struggled with low self-esteem, social anxiety, loneliness (friendship-wise and romantic-wise, even though I have a few friends), crippling depression, and other anxiety-related illnesses. Mental illness is the story of my life. Over the years, I have seen plenty of health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers), taken countless types of medications (bupropion, sertraline, prozac, lamotrigine, quetiapine, Ritalin, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, brexpiprazole...), followed therapies (CBT), read countless self-help books, and consulted support groups. I generally have an ideal lifestyle (exercise, great eating habits, good sleep, meditate, mindfulness). I have done EVERYTHING that is recommended for someone in my situation. If that's not your case, I apologize but you have absolutely no business considering suicide as an option.

And at this point in time, after all these years, I find myself EXACTLY where I started. As a matter of fact, things are only deteriorating as time passes for me. My suffering is only intensifying, and my desire to end it is only growing larger.

So this brings me to the point of my post : are there other people in the same boat, that feel that there is indeed a time, when you have exhausted your options, when ending it can really be considered acceptable and reasonable? We often hear people say, ""there is hope"", or ""things will get better"". Really? Have you felt like dying for two decades, went to see every possible ressource out there, and still have not found inner peace? I suspect that, as I said, people tend to put all ""depressions"" in the same basket. Not taking anything away from someone with post partum depression or post-divorce depression or similar ailments, but these can be attributed to a root cause around which you can work. In my case, I have spent years trying to make sense of my depression, trying to find a cause, but I am at a loss.

I truly believe, now, that there are some people, such as myself, that can never be saved. We have depression with a big ""D"". There is no identifiable ""cause"" to explain the empty feeling inside. There is no reason for the hopelessness. The darkness just ""is"". Medical professionals do not understand it and are simply powerless over it. I truly believe there are two choices for people like us : to end it now and alleviate the suffering, or to live in sadness and pain for the rest of our lives.

I am scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy soon, but I'm not sure I'm going to go. I fear that this treatment will simply be one more added to the long list of disappointments I have endured seeking help over the years.

I believe that things simply are as they are. Some people are simply given bad cards to play with in this life. And to me, the worst type of cards to be dealt, by far, are the faulty brain cards. The ""incapable of happiness"" cards. It is as it is and, frighteningly, my very much rational and scientific logic is pushing me closer and closer to the only ""effective"" treatment that I can see working to destroy my illness, and thus end my suffering...

Anybody else in this boat? Thoughts? Does anybody else think that, indeed, there is a time when the most reasonable, thought-out option could in fact be to end it? Can society ever understand this, understand the limit of science and ""accept"" someone doing the ""unacceptable""?

depression,"So this might be long, and for that I apologize. Let me begin by giving the briefest overview of the problems that bring me here today:

* From ages 3-8 I was very heavily abused in literally any way you want to imagine by my mother.
* Started living with my Dad when I was about 10, he passed away in his sleep when I was 11, and I was the one who found the body.
* Throughout my teen years, I bounced around between schools very often due to getting into too many fights/being bullied/""not being the right fit"", along with being homeless off and on.
* At 15, I met a girl that I fell in love with very deeply. When I was 19, she passed away while pregnant with my child.
* And finally, when I was 20, maybe 21, I met another girl who I, again, fell in love with very deeply, and dated her on and off for roughly 9 years, the relationship recently having been permanently ended as it had been very abusive for the last few years, and she did some stuff that I will SLIGHTLY elaborate on later that hurt me very deeply, and changed the way I saw her irrecoverably.

Due to the above factors, I have lived with depression for as long as I can remember, was diagnosed wth schizo-effective disorder at 14, and I'm terrified that I have Dissociative Fugue Disorder due to some very concerning instances of lost time/people saying I'm doing/saying shit and don't remember. But according to my ex, I'm just a liar who's not half as good as half the other men she's been with. So It's probably just that.

Not counting online friends/friends who I don't really keep in touch with, I have two friends. Just two. And those two friends are becoming more and more distant due to their own problems and struggles that they have to deal with, of which I hold no grudge or ill feelings. My relationship with my family is failing due to the fact that I live on social security, and constantly need to ask them for financial help that they simply cannot continue to provide, especially during these times.

I don't leave my house unless it's to buy groceries/check my mail. I'm pretty certain that my smoking habit has begun to cause. Some sort of chronic lung issue of some sort, I genuinely haven't gone to check it out yet. And I'm also very quickly becoming an alcoholic, now that I have virtually no one to really talk to anymore and am confined to my own thoughts.

TL;DR - No matter how hard I look, how hard I try, I cannot find any decent reason to just. Keep trying. It has gotten to a point where I genuinely cannot see any good, logical reason to continue smacking my head against this wall that is apparently my life. I need help. I need something. Someone. Anything, anyone, just. SOMETHING. To hold on to. Because I swear, it's like I can feel myself slipping, and I still have enough of me left to care about the people who care enough to be sad if anything were to happen to me. And I'm really. Really. REALLY. Tired of making people I care about sad and hurt. I just don't know what else to do.

I was just so full of angry in the moment then it immediately went to sadness. I don’t know if I just have this built up anger(it doesn’t feel like I do) or if it has to do with depression. Often times I can feel myself start to feel angry and I won’t have a clue as to why. Sometimes as fast as the anger comes it goes away or turns to sadness. I would like some input as depression and all its symptoms are still pretty new to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance.",Can depression cause you to be angry?,t3_gsbfdl,0
depression,"I made this a account just to post here, because my friends see what i post online and i dont want to unload that baggage on to them.   
My life is, objectively speaking, actually really good. I have a loving family and friends, i dont have to worry about my future, im 20 and i have more money saved than the average american has student loan debt and next week is the last exam i have before i get my admission to go to a university. 

All doors in my life are wide open, but i dont care. I used to care about alot of things, everything was interesting, there was always something to look forward to. Now i dont look forward to anything anymore and all the things i used to enjoy have just become a way to distract myself, from the emptiness i feel when my head isnt busy trying to comprehend new information coming in.  
If its not a particular bad day i dont really notice it when im doing stuff, its the moments of silence that get me.

I used to strugle with the meaning of life in the past because ever since i can remember i always thought of life as meaningless. I didnt care about it when i was younger, but when i became older i looked for a way to get some meaning. I came to the conclusion that, yes nothing matters, but not really. Nothing matters unless you choose it to matter. Yes my emotions are just the chemicals in my brain but that part doesnt matter to me, what does matter is that they can make me feel good and so i want to do the things that make me feel good, if possible with the foresight of long term happiness.

But that source of meaning just doesnt cut it anymore, because its a very flawed system.  
What if i dont choose anything to matter? What if there isnt anything anymore that makes me feel good or happy? What if the thing that makes me happy is thinking about my own death?

The scariest part about imagining death is the amount of excitement i get from thinking about it. It gives me a sense of reliev and freedome, like nothing else does. Finally i wouldnt have to feel this anymore. I dont know how to put this feeling into words, its not just emptiness, it feels like my chest is being pressed on and theres a small constant stream of adrenaline that my body puts out, mixed with an extreme sense of apathy.

There is probably only one thing i care about and thats the people i love. If i didnt have them i would have already driven my car into a wall or off a cliff, sometimes i come close but I just cant bring myself to do it.

depression," Sometimes I think depression gets this generalization of nothing but sadness. That is not the case. Everyone experiences it differently, but what I've realized is depression is also overwhelming anger. At everyone and everything. No one did anything to you, or harmed you in anyway. You're just mad as shit without a logical reason. But most importantly, you're beyond at livid at yourself. Constantly shit talking yourself like an angry boss at a office new hire. It's a bleak outlook on your life ever getting better, thinking that life sucks, and so do you and nothing will ever change. It's constant pessimism, at every waking turn, generally expecting the worse to happen because that's just your life. It's unwarranted explosive anger at your loved ones and closest friends because you can't keep your emotions in check because you're at a constant emotional war within yourself. It's overindulgence of bad coping mechanisms such as excessive porn usage and drinking alcohol like water. being hateful towards others for experiencing happiness and satisfaction and fulfillment while you experience the opposite.

depression,"Hello,

I am a 30/F nurse in the NYC area, have been recently totally overwhelmed with the COVID-19 cases but it is getting better. However, ever since this nightmare started my depression, anxiety and mood has been so bad. I have dealt with a lot during this pandemic, and have watched many people die, including colleagues. Now I find myself in a constant state of anger, sorrow, fatigue and irritability. This is catered solely to my job. At work, I am constantly irritated by everyone except the patients and my fellow nurses. However, when I feel like I am being asked something by a hospital colleague, someone who was/is able to stay home or work from an iPad during the pandemic, like the social workers/dietitian and many speciality doctors like neurologists or psychiatrists, I am so frustrated. 
I feel us nurses were so abused during this crisis, stepping into rooms to hold up an iPad for these specialities and allowing mass exposure to ourselves,  while they of them were able to sit comfortably at home to do their job while putting me and my nurse colleagues at risk. In their notes they would write “to limit personal exposure to COVID19, this interview was done via iPad”. Yes, to limit your exposure and massively increase my own! We did not receive any hazard pay, only empty accolades from hospital staff who would not even come to the floors with these sick covid patients to support us in any way while we were drowning in mass death and chaos. 

Those few weeks were so incredibly stressful and overwhelming, and I can’t stop thinking about it. And now, even though our COVID count has dropped so dramatically and we are regaining a sense of normalcy, some/most of these same staffers are still are not coming in and expect us to do iPad interviews for them, or ask the patient questions for them, each time increasing our exposure/risk. 

My anger and depression over this makes me cry almost every day, and I can’t even sleep anymore. All I do is think about my dead patients who I grew so close to and my dead colleagues, and those who I feel made this so much worse by jeopardizing my health to make themselves safe. I am planning on quitting my job soon due to these terrible feelings, but how do I move on from this?

depression,"Well, hi, first of all, sorry about my english.   
The reality is that i can't take all this anymore, my past is killing me, my present is making me cry, and my future scares a lot. I'm 22, I'm Argentinian, I'm a writer, and the quarantine is erasing me.

My problems began at the age of 10, more or less; in school. Almost all my classmates were awful. I live in a small town not too far from Buenos Aires, but it was enough to make people think like the 17th century.  
The little amount of friends i got where girls (I'm a boy), so, even when kids around 10 years old, that was cataloged as ""gay"". The boy must been with boy, the girls with girls. They started to laugh every day, every single of it. And on the days they did not, they left me alone. Anyone wanted to sit with me, talk to me, even touch me.  
At home, it was about all the same. My dad is and was male chauvinist, my mom didn't had much voice over the house, and I was the oldest brother. So, for this, anything was done with my ""school issue"", even the school doesn't care too much.

When I got to middle school everything went worse. I was 12, and I remember that year as one of the worst years of my life. The biggest problem reside in P.S. The subject was planned as girls with girls in a determined day and hour, and boys with boys in another day an hour. The start of teenage only made the problem worse. But this time, the P.S teacher participated in the whole thing. My classes always ended with me in tears. Every Tuesday and Thursday I arrive home crying, and only my mother was worried. My dad was limited to say: ""punch them! Don't let them feel you weak."", and things like that.  
My classmates used to cornered my on the breaks and ask me if I were a ""gay, or a super gay, o a little fucking passive gay"" and a lot of similar sentences. I couldn't do nothing. At that time I did not had the confidence or ""the muscles"" to defend myself. That also made me feel bad with myself.  
In the first and second year I lost almost all the friends I used to have. I was even more lonely than ever before. And the only place where I was the luck to made friends was the Xbox. I knew some Mexican guy around my age and, luckily, we become real good friends. I started to forget about my ""real world"". My purpose in living become on reaching home and turning on the Xbox so I could talk, smile and laugh with people I like. I lost interest in everything. I continued crying almost every day, but, for me, it was not a problem anymore, as long as, I had the Xbox.  
At the age of 14 I started reconsidering my sexuality. And I have the confidence to say, I'm very proud of myself in that aspect. Even on that environment, and surrendered with the people I were, I had the courage to assume I was and am gay. First, I told my Xbox friends about it, then a guy in school that was starting to be nice with me. And I regret it until today. He ""cheated"" on me. I told clearly to him please do not tell anybody; as so, the next day of school, every single kid there, everyone, knew. When they started to saw me entering by the door, all their eyes pointed at me. In that second, my life collapsed. I ran away from school, and I wait to the time passes to went back home.  
From that day, I started to feel fear. An intense fear. It scared me that my parents found out by someone else than myself. Because, I knew, it all, far to believing, might get worse. I decided, so, to tell them directly. And my god, it's a scene that make me cry even today. Both of them bombarded me with phrases that I don't think I could erase from my mind. My father went away after all of that. And then, the day after, he started to came every day, from almost a month, to my room to continuity say worse and worse thing about all the thing. He convinced me that I couldn't be gay, that it was wrong, that ""what would think the neighbours, my grandfathers, my classmates, my family..."". So then, he forces me to ""try with a woman"", because then, and only then, I could have the real security, if I was or not gay. He sent me, at the age of 15, with no one, but three prostitutes. And it was seemed that he won't stop until I said to him what was pretending to hear: ""Yes, dad, you were right, I'm heterosexual"". I take over three, and then, I say it.  
He smiled. And all stopped.  
On school I said an excuse that my father told me to say, and all stopped.  
But on the Xbox I was still me, on secret, but still me. Why on secret? Well, I said I was reconsidering what I already said, but maybe I were Bi.  
From there on, I force me to watch heterosexual porn, watch girls instead of boy. I was forcing myself on not being what I was, not searching what I like. And entered on a depression that anybody care. Because it wasn't important while I like girls instead of boys.

6 month later, my mom committed a try of suicide. By the magic of biology, she didn't died. But, for me, she did. Our relationship where improving over the years to now on, but it is not the same for me.  
But when all that happened, I exploded. I was not interested on living anymore, but I didn't know how to kill myself.  
So one day, in my grandfather's house, I found a gun. I put it on my mouth. I was alone. And couldn't do it. I left. I left and run, and the Xbox save me again, my friends were there, waiting for me. And smiled.

Time passed and I finished middle school.  
That where all started to become better. I went to Buenos Aire to do college, I met new people, I made friends, I left this ghost town, my family, my past, and everything; sadly, for only 8 hours a day.  
Was a wonderful year, a really good year. But, at the end, my father, who was paying my studies, stopped for no reason. And reality hit me again. I was with no clue for what to do next. I become an sad boy again, my happiness disappeared, and my town started to consume me again.  
At next year my mind made a switch. The loneliness and unhappiness force me to made a change: I get out of the closet once more. But I promised me that I will be what I wanted to be no matter what. And, so, I did. My father were divorced since the try of suicide of my mom, and I cut all connection with my father after what he did with my college studies. So I came out, and try to start a new life from there.

The year was 2017, and I had my first boyfriend. We didn't last much, but it was a nice experience. Also, was the first time I had -real- sex. And I enjoy it a lot. But then it all finished. I don't feel as sad I thought I would be. I felt lonely again. The Xbox was a thing of the past, and I didn't have friends at all.

So then, 2018 came. I started a new career by myself (this said, I didn't depend from anyone), and in April, I new someone else. And god... was the beginning of the end.  
I don't have enough words to describe that year, those feelings. It was something like a roller coaster. I started to ""break"" all my reprimed past with my new boyfriend. I started to compare my life to his and started to feel so bad. I made myself dependent of him. I made him my world, my motivation; my everything. He was younger. We loved each other so much, so well. But i was not happy as I would like. My self esteem was getting so low that I almost cry everyday. But with him I was extremely happy.  
And also, I were in Buenos Aires almost all days. I started to do the life I always wanted, to feel loved, happy, and free. I did almost all the things I always dream about, I had the routine I always fantasized. And I feel as loved as never.  
And then, it all fell. We ended in a troubled relationship, and te problem, believe it or not, wasn't much my fault. He lied to me with the basics, he refused to communicate, he lost interest, his circle was pressing him to left me. It happened at the end of the same year.  
I never felt more depressed in my life. All crashed at the same time. The past, the fantasy of infinite happiness, the lost of the only person I could say I loved, my self esteem become even lower. And I started to thought about suicide almost every day.  
I arrived at a point of no regression and started going, for the first time, to a psychologist. It helped. But not too much.

I reach 2019 crying, wanting to kill myself, to stop the pain my heart was taking. I tried to get hit by a train, I tried 3 times; couldn't do it. To all the things I was feeling, melancholia joined.  
And then, again on April, he came back. And I ran to him with no doubt. But things weren't the same. We finished again in 4 months. And all the same feelings crashed on me again. Luckily I was capable to make a few friends on college, so I didn't feel as lonely as before. A lot of me changed in that second half of the year.  
And in December, he appeared again, for the third time. We were back together again. ""This in the good one"" he told me. And it seems that it was true. I passed a happy summer, and, at all the time passed, my self esteem was solid again. Well, ""solid"". But way better than before. It was not the same again, but, for me, it was better than being alone in my town.

And then 2020. And with it, the quarantine. Sadly, we broke up again. He realised that he didn't want a relationship at all. He wasn't the boy I used to know, so I understand: i wasn't either happy as I used to be with him. We finished, and the melancholy started to rise again, the quarantine doesn't help, my loneliness doesn't help, my house doesn't help. I feel melancholy about 2018, not him. I feel melancholy about the happiness i experienced in that year, the freedom, the ""reconstruction"" it made on my life, my mind, and my heart. I've never felt as lonely as I feel now. And I don't know when I will be able to travel to Buenos Aires again.  
Finally, I always were a sexual person, I liked to much, I enjoy masturbation a lot, and since 2017, I enjoy sex a lot. 2018 made me discovered a lot, made me enjoy a lot. Is one of the thing I miss more about him in general. I was masturbating a lot on the last days, but my psychologist discovered, some days ago, I suffer (also) ""Post-coital tristesse"", so she recommended me to stop all sexual activity for as long as I can. She suggested that, in possible, I only have sex with a person I have confidence, she also asked me to stop masturbating. And, to be honest, it smashed me. Sex for me it was always a really nice thing, a way to give love, to someone or to myself.  
Now I'm asking if a want to be that kind of person. I have to desexualize every aspect of my life (my Post-coital tristesse is severe). I don't want that, I was thinking about finishing all again, I'm really depressed, melancholic, and with a lot of doubts about my future and my capabilities.

It seems that It never stops. The amount of things that, I feel, makes my life miserable, doesn't stops.  
I cried on every single word of this text, I try to cut my arm with a knife last night, and I couldn't stop regretting my life at a hole.

Sorry about this being so long, I just wanted to speak with someone.

depression,"Mid last year I was diagnosed with Psychotic Depression  This condition causes you to experience psychotic symptoms plus the sadness and hopelessness associated with depression. This means seeing, hearing, smelling, or believing things that aren’t real.

Thing is, after being diagnosed I still feel the thing that I thought was true, even now. After being diagnosed I suppressed everything and avoided telling anyone any details except my ex who I had told about the things I thought were true but no one confirmed it. 

I still believe it, but I was too stubborn to be hospitalized... so I had to pretend to be okay. I went crazy, homeless and had a few fall-outs with some family members before I was finally able to suppress everything enough to start studying this year and work over quarantine.

I'm able to focus on work and uni but one of the things that this experience has injured is my social skills. I don't trust anyone. I get anxiety when I talk to people. I don't have friends at work or uni. My speech is starting to worsen each day, I've noticed i slur my words since I barely talk anymore.

depression,"Ive been diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

I started taking Paxil when I was 18 for depression and anxiety. It both helped and destroyed different aspects of my life. I switched to Lexapro 20mg daily 10 years later and have been taking it ever since (10 years).

I also recently added Wellbutrin to the mix at 300mg daily. 

Thought my time with Paxil and Lexapro, I've experienced withdrawal symptoms like brain zaps, nausea, vertigo and diarrhea whenever I'd miss my dose for a few days.

I've tried to get off Paxil and Lexapro un the past, but wasn't successful. I became really agitated, I couldn't think or function well. I lost one job, quit another and ended a relationship during these times of trying to get off. The fallout of my behavior would result in depression, which led me back to taking the drug to gain some stability again.

During the recent lockdown, I haven't been able to get my meds as frequently as I once was able to. I'm still taking Wellbutrin, but I haven't taken Lexapro for about 2 weeks now.

The brain zaps, nausea, and diarrhea started a few days ago. Although, this time around, the agitation is minimal and manageable. I also feel less a lot less anxious then when I was on Lexapro. Another benefit I'm seeing is a clearer mind... For the past few days I've noticed I can focus and understand concepts much better than before.

I'm considering stopping Lexapro altogether, and sticking just with Wellbutrin, but I'm worried that I'll reach a point where my agitation becomes unmanageable, and I start sabotaging my life again. 

I think the addition of Wellbutrin this time around may be helping with the withdrawal from Lexapro, but I'm not certain.

I wanted to get the community's insight into this and maybe hear of any similar experiences the same cocktail of drugs or something similar.

I plan to talk with my doctor about this, but wanted to post this on Reddit in the meantime.",Advice for stopping Lexapro (Cipralex) after 20 years of anti-depressants.,t3_gseoch,0

within the past month or so my parents have temporarily separated and are going to couples counseling. a week after they started going to that my mom started going to solo therapy— which is great! after the first fucking session the therapist told her to go to her doctor to see about antidepressants.... here’s where the issue begins.

last year she was on Zoloft and stopped after i uh... you know.... *tried to yeet with them*. but there was no change in her. it’s like she wasn’t even on them in the first place, she just completely stopped like it was nothing. fast forward to now, she started talking about how bad her “depression” is and has been... yet she did nothing until a few weeks ago. this week she started talking about her “”anxiety””. here’s the bullshit: for the past 5 years of my life she has punished me for showing signs of depression and ridiculed me for being anxious. now she expects my pity for her “depression”*

depression,"  Suicide is hard to think about for so many reasons. The first one is, you never feel ready. There’s so many thoughts that come to mind and things to do or say before. Even when people try to talk you out of it, it doesn’t change anything. I’m so numb to everything, it all just feels so numb. I feel so rejected in so many ways. My father gave up on me ten years ago, my ex girlfriend doesn’t want anything to do with me, it feels like I’m a disappointment to my family after they found out about some of my issues, I feel like I’ve already thrown my life away because of my grades, I stopped caring about school, I just feel like I’m always in a room alone. Even at big events, it’s like looking out a window at happy people. The suicide hotline doesn’t really help. I spoke with a really nice lady though a while back on the hotline named April. I’ll never forget her, she really did seem to care, and relate to me. She offered to call me back days later but I never picked up the phone. A few months later, nothing. I regret not answering. Everyone else I’ve talked too on the hotline just said cliche things and didn’t help at all. I’ve tried to get help, I spoke with my old therapist and it just wasn’t helping. I felt like she didn’t understand as well as April did. I wish I could find someone who understands me. Everybody seems to be in a different reality than me. I feel like I’m in this world all by myself, that nobody truly cares. I wish I could go back in time and appreciate things more, to not take so much for granted. I love my friends and family. Sometimes it probably doesn’t seem like it but I think a lot. I’m always thinking about people. Suicide isn’t a natural thing that someone just thinks of one day, it’s something you think of for weeks, months or even years. You begin to make that thought more comfortable, until it starts to not feel as scary. You get the fear out of the way so that you can go through with it. You begin to realize how things pile up, and suicide starts to feel like an old friend, or sometimes, your only friend. A friend who can take you away from this cruel world, someone who is there for you when you’re ready. There is always fear when thinking it through and I’m sure it’s really intense if you are about to go through with it. The people who attempt suicide, they are beyond saving, the thought process leading up to is too long and painful. I’m still here and still too scared to go through with it. But I know the day will come someday when I lose fear. Once you lose fear, you’ve already lost everything else. It’s all so intense, and people see you as odd, or mentally ill. I hate it when people look and treat me like that, like they’re guilty, or if they talk to you in a certain way you’ll feel better. I want people to treat me normal, but it’s impossible after you discuss this topic. People see you as delicate, or a ticking time bomb.  They call you strong, but treat you like you’re weak. There’s no winning, I’m tired of feeling like this, tired of it all. Tired of hurting people, tired of being such a bad influence on my friends and family. I guess we can call it “depression.” This depression is eating me alive. I would say I want help, but all “help” is, is people in a hospital watching you and talking to you like a child. All “help” is, is a psychologist ending a meeting on a big issue to ensure you come back and pay them again. All “help” is, is people telling you cliche things over and over not knowing how numb you are. It’s exhausting.",A paragraph from my journal,t3_gsih1q,0

depression,"I feel as if though my personality and thought process is very eccentric. I grew up mostly by myself, I had no real friends, I constantly felt out of place. I became depressed at the age of 13, dropped out at 17 and became an alcoholic at 18. I spent the next 3 years without a job, all I did during this time was  trying to figure myself and this life out. I've never come to any sort of conclusion other than that I'm alone in this world, all my social skills have withered away and now I can barely hold a conversation for longer than a couple of seconds. 

My sanity declined, I became apathetic towards everything in life, and I've had many mental breakdowns along the way. The more recent ones I've had included very surreal derealisation episodes where it felt as if my mind escaped my body for a moment, funny enough these have been the most euphoric experiences I've ever felt, so much so that it almost felt spiritual. 

I've tried to make friends, but no one is willing to put in any effort in me. I've tried so many times that I've grown tired of trying, so I decided to give up the idea of establishing any sort of new relationships with people. Instead I intend on living out this ordeal by myself, and eventually die by my own hands. After every breakdown I feel myself drifting ever closer to the end, and at the same time coming to terms with my existence as I find acceptance in my own sorrow. And once my suffering and acceptance align I will die, or so I envision it.

   A doctor came in and sat down with me and actually talked with me about my life which was very comforting. He told me he honestly thinks I have depression/anxiety and it combined with the stress of  work/home resulted in a bad panic attack and suggested I go see a physiologist.

I just don't know what to do. I'm sure I might be suffering from some sort of depression, have felt miserable for a long, long time now, but I just try to get on with life, but lately with this lock down and really having no social aspect to live, with being away from work on furlough, I've started to feel worse and worse. 

Short back story, I'm 31 and male, never really had much of a social life outside work, and very obese. Since last June I had decided to try and do something about myself, started a diet, lost 4 stone and finally encouraged my self to go to the gym in February of this year, went twice, really enjoyed it. Was going with a friend who was trying to help me, encourage me, he knows what feeling like this was like, he went through it when he was younger. Then lock down happened, and I've just spiraled out if control. Daily I just can't be bothered with life, don't see the point. Don't get my wrong, I'm not suicidal, but I just don't care anymore, but I want to. I really want to. I've started sleeping through the day, don't enjoy playing games like I used to, eat cos I'm bored, stopped exercising and regularly say to the cat that if she wasn't here, I'd have no reason to be here. I live alone, I always have since my mum moved out to care for my Grandad who was dieing of cancer 13 years ago. I'm not house proud, but even less so right now. I don't want to speak to my friends or family about how I feel, they've no idea. I want to speak to a GP, but concerned that I'll wake up tomorrow morning and just think ""fuck it"", so made a throwaway account to pour my self out to people I don't know.

Hi all. I’m 2 months pp and hoping to hear from others. it went well for about a month and then I crashed HARD. I’ve had anxiety and depression issues intermittently throughout life. I lost my milk supply due to anxiety which ended up making it worse with a rush of hormones and guilt that I wasn’t giving my daughter the best. I ended up in in-patient for a few nights as I thought I couldn’t do it anymore. 

Since then I’ve started on Citalopram and Trazedone for sleep. I believe the SSRI started to help a little bit but I feel like I can’t wait one more day to feel normal again. 

I love my daughter but every day is so hard. Getting out of bed is hard. Getting clothes on is hard. Washing bottles is hard. 

One of the worst things? I can’t sleep. As soon as I lay down I get a rush of adrenaline and heart palpitations. It makes taking care of my daughter even harder on a few hours of sleep a night. A couple nights I didn’t sleep one minute which required me to lean on my parents to take care of my daughter as I laid there like a zombie.

depression,"People who suffer from depression don't think of it as ""suffering"". It is just a constant state of being. It's a constant dark companion.

They won't talk to or call a friend or family member because they are often told their feelings and thoughts are invalid. 

They are the ones who listen to your problems and try so hard to bring reason or healing - or bring a smile. Helping others sometimes helps them. 

They don't seek help because it's not a one-time event. It's regular or always. They love you too much to bother you that much. 

They don't think you'll understand. Of if you do, you'll grown as tired of them as they do of feeling that way.

Sometimes the reasons seem concrete and incontrovertible. Other times it's a vague darkness. Always, knowing others don't feel this way (this often) they feel broken and worthless ...adding to the problem. 

Sometimes it becomes crippling causing real problems in other areas of life and causing more (some would say, valid) reasons for hopelessness.

depression,"I am a 22 year old male, and I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I always felt a bit out of touch mentally with everything which could be to do with my autism that I was never told about, which I found out through some lost files after both of my parents died. On my 19th birthday my mum was rushed to hospital because of a brain haemorrhage which was totally out of the blue, and then she was quickly diagnosed with stage 3 brain cancer. I was always close to my mum as my parents were separated all my life, I loved her more than anything in the world and we would spend so much time together so this crushed me. She then passed away on Christmas day after spending the whole of new years till Christmas morning in the hospital. My mum had found a partner previous which she married when I was 17, making this partner my step-dad. I have two younger brothers and we were left with nothing in the will. We didn't even get a will hearing. My mum had won a lot of money previous which went straight towards a big house and then there were a lot of savings, she would have done anything she could for me and my brothers cause she was an amazing person.

This step-dad then became extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive towards my middle brother and alienated him from me and my youngest. I was working full time during this period also. Once my younger brother left (Half kicked out/half could not cope being in the house with step-dad) after his whole room being destroyed by step-dad over supposed lying, all the abuse came on to me and I couldn't see it at the time as he was the only adult figure I had in my life. He drank excessively, destroyed cars through drunk driving that my mum had paid for, told me there was no money left despite him constantly buying designer clothes, making me cook the same meals every night after work, belittled me and calling me pathetic and stupid. It was every single day I was being ground down and I hadn't grieved over the loss of my mum. I then ended up in a positive relationship with who is now my ex, who helped me to get out the house understand the manipulation i was put through etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To cut this short, I was not allowed to come back into the house for bullshit reasons such as it's him living his own life. Me and my brothers have not seen any inheritance or support whatsoever. I broke up with my girlfriend because I thought it was the right thing to do for my mental state but even if I wanted to get back with her things would be a mess and I would have totally lost the respect of her family and it is also incredibly difficult to even move to another flat cause of fucking money and paperwork. I also have university now but I can't even finish my year cause of this virus, and it requires me to work with other people for my last modules which is impossible to do according to the brief. I've had a package thrown at me by step-dad's new fucking wife who the police is now involved with and I havent got any response back from any solicitor saying that this case with contesting the will is just a mess.

I've lost hope in humanity, this world, the law, and education which i was enjoying right until the outbreak. Police are murdering people in America, police can't fucking do anything in the UK that's positive. The government are full of hypocrites, and there is no support whatsoever in my situation.

depression,"Hi everyone,

So my problem is in the title. Had bad depression with suicidal attempts for most of my life. Mental hospital was shit that screwed me up even more. My personal psychiatrist has tried her best but nothing works.

We tried everything. Medicine: sertraline, citolopram, cymbalta, paxil, trazodone, mitrazapine, buproprion, amitriptyline, notriptyline, quetiapine (for sleep). Plus Psychotherapy, talk therapy and hypotherapy.

Therapy doesn't do shit for me, because I have real problems and no resourses to solve them. Talking can't doesn't solve big problems. I was hoping that that medication could reduce some of my symptoms, depression, mental function etc. They all failed to help in any way, also they all gave me bad side effects, which caused me to develop additional health problems (in addition to various already existing chronic problems that I had before).

The only thing that was really helping me was some lifestyle chances, church, talking to my priest, etc. I was still depressed, but I somehow had everything together, until about two weeks ago I started falling apart again. The last few days were even worse, depression is suffocating me, I lost my ability to think properly, and I cant eat for the last 2 days. Anything I force myself to eat ends up being immediately vomited out (this is a weird thing which always happens when I'm really down).

But I don't know what the fuck to do? If I go back to the hospital, they would just put me back on the same medications and therapies that never did anything in the first place.

Not to mention I hate that hospital because they massively screwed up my medical records: one of many examples -  A drunk racist man attacked me and threatened to kill me (I'm black). Well after that I was nervous, because someone actually tried to kill me. After the incident I had a few drinks to calm myself down because well someone tried to kill me (there are many witnesses who can prove I was right).

You know what those doctors wrote? That I suddenly developed bipolar, got myself drunk and attacked a random man. That's a complete lie, they never bothered asking the witnesses if what I said was the truth, and those people are willing to talk, hotel staff, waiters, etc they saw everything happen, and were willing to talk to the police, but the police never showed up, because the doctors told them I was bipolar. I was never bipolar, I'm down all the fucking time.

Maybe I could go to another hospital. But what is the point when they'll give me the same meds and treatments that don't work on me?

I feel like I'm going to explode, and I don't know what to do. Antidepressants and Therapy are the standard ways of fixing this problem, and neither of them work for me. It doesn't seem like there is anything that I could do, even if I did check myself in. Maybe I'll just stay here until I collapse.",Depression's stronger than ever.

At this stage, you're too senile to no longer travel, your joints hurt to the point where you can barely walk around the block. You're just there, alone with your thoughts.

What do you want to think about?

So many of us sacrifice precious hours of our lives in our 20s doing, perhaps, shit all. You reach 30, then you realise, ""holy shit I'm 30"" and then proceed to get your shit together. Some people don't - they remain stuck with the 20-year-old mindset. Sleeping around, drinking, procrastinating important things to do in life, going through meaningless relationships that inevitably fail due to unaddressed personal problems…

Perhaps you have kids, but you're nowhere near ready to have them. You're cynical, you want them to be what you want them to be - you fail to learn how to parent properly and in doing so your children don't give you the love and affection that you once thought you'd inherit.

Quite a cynical view right? Yeah, it is. BUT.

As long as you're not on your deathbed I truly believe we all are capable of change. No one can change the past, not even God. What you could do though is change the way you view your past. Perhaps the things I've listed above may resonate with you, but, it's okay.

We're human and in being human we're fallible to life's tragedies. Perhaps you could even argue that's what gives life it's diversity.

I know some people who've changed careers when they hit 40.

Some people have kids in their teens and that drove them into adulthood with vigour and courage.

Some people start their business at 50 after a long career, slaving away in corporate life for 20 years.

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg in what may encompass diversity in people's lives. It's important to realise no matter what mistakes you've made in the past, it's time to reconcile with them and conceptualise it into one of learning, and experience. It's hard, don't get me wrong. We all have perhaps made fucked up mistakes that have led to where we are today.

depression,I found out a week ago that I have become unexpectedly pregnant and then two days later got laid off of my full time job and lost my insurance. I’ve never felt so low in my life. I keep just laying in bed crying feeling so numb and alone and helpless and I know I need to be coming up with a plan be it abortion/adoption/trying to find a new job but I’m so depressed I feel like I’m in a coma. Just laying here day after day. My room is a mess and I have no groceries and I don’t know what to do. I keep having these horrible violent intrusive thoughts (I’ve never experienced anything like this before) and am convinced that everyone would be embarrassed for me/of me if they knew what was going on. I don’t know how I’m going to pay rent and bills and don’t even know where to begin when my brain is attacking me at every turn. I know this situation is kinda specific but I have no experience dealing with depression before and I’m hoping someone might have some advice.,I found out I’m pregnant and then lost my job,t3_gs49hs,0
depression,"**Disclaimer:** *This post has to due with sexual themes, so if this could possibly be a trigger for you, please do scroll passed. Thank you.*

Before I start, let me preface something; I'm one-hundred and ten percent a virgin. Don't assume for a second that I'm some Chad complaining that I get too much sex or something. I've never even hugged or dated a girl before, let alone have sexual relations with one. That being said, I'll start. 

I hate sex and being sexually driven. I'm seventeen, so my hormones are constantly skull-fucking me, no pun intended. I get aroused many times throughout the day and it happens easier than I'd like to admit. When I get that way I often make stupid decisions, or I'll talk to a person in the hopes of sexual gain whether I'm aware of it or not. I'll watch excessive amounts of pornography just to help get it over with so I can move on with my day. Does it keep me from doing things? No, I can live without masturbating, but it's so, so fucking annoying to be aroused when I'm trying to just go about my day.

You may ask ""Why do you hate it so much? It's one of the few pleasures people like us have."" or something like that. Well, quite frankly, I find that statement to be ignorant. I'd rather go my whole life being a virgin if it meant I could maintain what little innocence I have left in my being. To be able to pursue a relationship without having to question whether I only like them because I want to have sex with them or if it's because I truly love them. To be able to take things lightly and not always assume that the things people say are euphemisms and shit like that. I want to be able to look at a girl and think ""Wow, she seems nice."" or ""Wow, I really enjoy her outfit."" rather than ""Man, the things I'd do to her."" or ""Man, she is *way* out of my league."" It can be really, really fucking debilitating. I hate when I'm in public or with a female acquaintance and my eyes trail off to parts of her body as if they were fucking magnetic. I hate it, I hate it, I *hate* it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know being as young as I am may be a deterrent for most of the people on here. ""Oh, you're too young and juvenile to understand."" Fuck you. I don't care how young I am, I've seen and experienced more than I should have at this age, so I feel as though I don't deserve to be baby talked. Am I juvenile and ignorant in ways? Yes. But, for the most part, my eyes have been opened. And I can say, with every shred of confidence I can muster in my being, I fucking hate sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the aggressive tone this gave off, it in no way reflects myself as a person, but I just have so much pent up anger, sadness, and general frustration with this topic. Please tell me I'm not alone. I feel so alone in my thoughts and principles. I doubt I articulated myself well enough, and I highly doubt I said all I wanted to say, but it's probably best I leave it at this. Either way, thanks for reading.

depression,"I've been depressed for almost 3 years now, (which I know doesn't seem that long) but honestly I'm so exhausted of loosing so much. In the last few years, I feel like I have been a shell of a person, unable to commit to anything because I'm either depressed or anxious. I haven't pursued any of the dreams of things I set out to, because I spend most of my time stuck in my own misery. To make things even worse, I was delusional and told myself that finally now that I had the time, I could take some real time to improve myself and take care of myself. Instead, these last few months has just been a repeat of the last 2 shitty years, but instead compressed into months. I just have so much time to think about it all, and I keep coming to the same realization: I am just a broken person pretending that I'm doing better. 

And honestly, I can feel myself slip away again, with the increased disassociation, self harm, panic attacks and depressive episodes, but I seem to be unable to do a thing about it. Because every time that I do, I just end up back where I started, reminding myself that even if I could do better, I could never deserve it. 

Sorry for this rant of a post, but I just really needed to get some things off my chest. I hope everyone is doing a bit better than me during these weird times, and I'd really welcome any response, advice or just someone to tell me I'm not actually loosing my head.","I'm tired of loosing time, control and myself",t3_gsbx4e,0

This test result was the last drop that brought back my depression and suicidal thoughts.

I have been self harm free and clean from alcohol for quite a time , but here I am sitting with the biggest and sharpest knife I could find and considering if I shouldnt make this cut the final one.

depression,"This is now my second post this week but I don´t know what else to do. After having my worst breakdown about a month ago, I started feeling empty or happy, I´m not sure, but still having suicidal thoughts and self harming. 

The current week  I had 1 and a half days of good days where I actually was happy and it scares me.       
 I´m not sure if it´s just a good week or if it´s over. I really hope it´s the first one. I suffered now for nearly a year and this sickens me because when it´s over now it´s just been a year. 

The´re people out there that lived with depression for years decades even and I tried to suffocate my self with being only depressed for a year. It´s just that it feels so insignificant, I haven´t even been to a doctor yet which makes me feel that it´s even more insignificant. What if it was just my hormones freaking out because of puberty that messed things up, or I just pretended. 

With all that mess I also now have like so much schoolwork due that I just couldn´t do and still can´t do today. At this point I´m not sure If I´m lazy or it´s the ""depression"".

Tomorrow I´m meeting friends again in two months and I really hope that it makes me feel like shit so I don´t feel this doubt and dissapointment for being happy. Just feeling pure sadness and falling back in a deep hole.",Running in Circles,t3_gs7evl,0
